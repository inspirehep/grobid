In particular the <lb/>muon multiplicity distribution, that gives information on the primary cosmic ray composition in the energy range <lb/>beyond the knee, has shown some unexpected events of very high multiplicity. The search and the study of these <lb/>events, already detected in previous experiments as ALEPH and DELPHI at LEP, will be discussed in detail. An <lb/>interpretation of these events detected by ALICE, in terms of standard cosmic ray composition with the use of the <lb/>latest hadronic interaction models, will be discussed. <lb/> Keywords: Cosmic rays, Atmospheric muons, High Energy Interactions. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> ALICE [?] is one of the four big experiments of the LHC <lb/>(Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. It is mainly dedicated to <lb/>study a new phase of matter, called QGP (Quark Gluon Plas-<lb/>ma), created in heavy-ion collisions at very high energies. <lb/>Although its main purpose is the analysis of the collisions at <lb/>LHC, it can also operate to detect atmospheric muons pro-<lb/>duced by cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere. The <lb/>use of high-energy collider detectors for cosmic-ray physics <lb/>was pioneered during the era of the Large Electron-Positron <lb/>(LEP) collider at CERN by the ALEPH[?], DELPHI[?], and <lb/>L3[?] collaborations. An evolution of these programmes is <lb/>possible at the LHC, where the experiments are expected <lb/>to operate for many years, with the possibility of recording <lb/>a large amount of cosmic data. In this context, ALICE be-<lb/>gan a programme of cosmic data-taking, collecting data for <lb/>physics for approximately 32 effective days in 2010-2013 <lb/>(more than 30 million events recorded), during pauses in <lb/>LHC operations. Since 2012, in addition to this standard <lb/>cosmic data-taking, a special trigger configuration allowed <lb/>the detection of cosmic events during proton-proton colli-<lb/>sion runs. Because the experiment is located 40 m under-<lb/>ground, with 30 m of overburden rock, only muons with <lb/>an energy larger than 15 GeV can reach the apparatus. The <lb/>muons with zenith angle in the range 0  o  − 60  o  are detect-<lb/>ed in the central barrel and tracked with the ALICE-TPC <lb/>(Time Projection Chamber), while the Forward Muon Spec-<lb/>trometer (FMS) is employed for the detection of the near-<lb/>horizontal muons (zenith angle in the range 70  o  − 85  o  ). In <lb/>this paper contribution, we present a detailed analysis of <lb/>the muon multiplicity distribution detected in the ALICE <lb/>central barrel including a comparison between data and MC <lb/>Corsika[?] events as well as the properties of the muon bun-<lb/>dles (cosmic events with a huge number of paralell muons), <lb/>recorded so far, with more than 100 muon tracks. <lb/> Fig. 1: The ALICE spectrometer at Point2-LHC. <lb/> 2 Atmospheric muons in the central barrel <lb/> Specific triggers have been implemented to detect atmo-<lb/>spheric muons crossing the central barrel (detectors insid-<lb/>e the magnet) of the ALICE apparatus (Fig. 1). For this <lb/>purpose, three detectors have been employed: ACORDE, <lb/>TOF (Time of Flight) and SPD (Silicon Pixel Detector). A-<lb/>CORDE has 60 scintillator modules located on the three <lb/>upper faces of the magnet yoke, covering 10% of its area. <lb/>The trigger is given by the coincidence of the signals in two <lb/>different modules (two-fold coincidence). <lb/>TOF is a cylindrical MRPC (Multi-gap Resistive-Plate <lb/>Chamber) array with a very large area surrounding com-<lb/>pletely the TPC. The trigger requires one pad fired in the <lb/>upper part of the TOF and one pad in the opposite lower <lb/>part. <lb/>SPD is composed of two layers of silicon pixel modules <lb/>located very close to the interaction point. The trigger is <lb/>given by the coincidence of two signals in the top and <lb/>bottom halves of the external layer. <lb/></body>

			<body>Fig. 2: Single atmospheric muon. The TPC reconstructs it <lb/>as two matched tracks. <lb/>An atmospheric muon crossing the apparatus is recon-<lb/>structed by the TPC as two tracks: one in the upper semi-<lb/>cylinder (track up), the other in the lower semi-cylinder <lb/>(track down), as shown in Fig. 2. A specific algorithm to <lb/>match the two tracks has been developed for cosmic events <lb/>in order to count the exact number of muons, and to mea-<lb/>sure the momentum with a better precision using the w-<lb/>hole track length of the particle. Most of the events are sin-<lb/>gle muon or multimuons (Fig. 6 ), with a small percentage <lb/>of interaction events, which occur when a very energetic <lb/>muon interacts with the iron of the magnet yoke producing <lb/>a shower of particles crossing the TPC . Only single and <lb/>multimuon events are analyzed in this paper. <lb/>The correlation between the zenith and the azimuth <lb/>angles of the atmospheric muons shows an increase in their <lb/>number in the direction corresponding to the two shafts, as <lb/>shown in Fig. 3. This is due to a lower energy threshold <lb/>required to reach the apparatus. Muons with zenith angles <lb/>in the range 0  o  − 20  o  (near-vertical muons) are not affected <lb/>by the shaft structures, regardless their azimuth angle. <lb/> 3 Muon multiplicity distribution. Data vs. <lb/>MC comparison <lb/> The TPC excellent tracking performance can be exploited to <lb/>measure the main characteristics of the muon track -such as <lb/>momentum, charge, direction and spatial distribution-with <lb/>good resolution, while the arrival time can be measured <lb/>with a precision of 100 ps with the TOF. In particular the <lb/>ability for tracking a high density of muons -unimaginable <lb/>with a standard cosmic-ray apparatus, together with the <lb/>measurement of all of these observables at the same time-<lb/>permits a new approach to the analysis of cosmic events, <lb/>which has so far not been unexploited. For these reasons, <lb/>the main research related to the physics of cosmic rays <lb/>with the ALICE experiment has centred on the study of <lb/> Fig. 3: Zenith vs azimuth angle of the muons in ALICE. <lb/>the muon-multiplicity distribution and in particular high-<lb/>density events. <lb/>The analysis of the data taken in 2010-2013 revealed a <lb/>muon multiplicity distribution that can be reproduced only <lb/>by a mixed composition. Figure 4 shows the multiplicity <lb/>distribution for real data taken in 2011, together with <lb/>the behaviour of MC CORSIKA multiplicity distribution, <lb/>assuming pure proton and pure iron composition for the <lb/>primaries, with 10 12  − 10 14 eV energy. It is clear from the <lb/>simulation that the lower multiplicities are closer to the pure <lb/>proton points, while at higher multiplicities the data tends to <lb/>approach the iron points. This behaviour is expected from a <lb/>mixed composition that on average increases the mass of <lb/>the primary when its energy increases, a result confirmed by <lb/>several previous experiments. However, five events found in <lb/>an interval of 30 days of effective data taking, taken between <lb/>2010 and 2013, (see Figure 5 ) have an unexpectedly large <lb/>number of muons. Each one of those high muon multiplicity <lb/>(hmm) events, have more than 100 reconstructed TPC <lb/>tracks, arriving at the ALICE spectrometer within a zenith <lb/>angular aperture of 0 0  − 50 0 degrees, giving a rate of 1 <lb/>hmm event each 6 days. Table 1. shows some properties <lb/>of those hmm events. In particular the highest multiplicity <lb/>reconstructed by the TPC has a muon density of 18 µ/m  2 . <lb/>The event display of this event, shown in Figure 6, gives an <lb/>idea of the TPCs capabilities in tracking such high particle <lb/>densities without problems of saturation, a performance <lb/>that was never achieved in previous experiments. <lb/>The estimated energy of the primary cosmic ray for this <lb/>event is at least 3 × 1016eV , assuming that the core of the <lb/>air shower is inside ALICE and that the primary particle <lb/>is an iron nucleus. Recalling that the rate of the cosmic <lb/>rays is 1 event per square metre per year at the energy of <lb/>the knee in the spectrum (3 × 10 15  eV ), and that over one <lb/>decade in energy the flux decreases by a factor of 100, an <lb/>event with this muon density is expected in ALICE in 4-5 <lb/>years of data. Since other events of high multiplicity have <lb/>been found in few days of data taking, further investigation <lb/>and detection is necessary to understand whether they are <lb/>caused by standard cosmic rays -and whether the high <lb/>multiplicity is simply a statistical fluctuation-or whether <lb/></body>

The red (blue) line corre-<lb/>sponds to pure proton (iron) primary composition obtained <lb/>by Corsika MS (ref) <lb/> ALI-PERF-15720 <lb/> Fig. 5: Atmospheric muon multiplicity distribution for the <lb/>data taken in the 2010-2013 data taking period (28 live <lb/>time). Five events, with more than 100 tracks, arriving to <lb/>ALICE with an angular zenith aperture of 0 − 50 0 degree. <lb/>they have a different production mechanism. A detailed <lb/>study of these events has not shown any unusual behaviour <lb/>in the other measured variables. For all of these reasons it is <lb/>important to see whether other unexpected high-multiplicity <lb/>events could be detected and at what rate. To this end, in <lb/>addition to standard cosmic runs, a special trigger with <lb/>requiring the coincidence of at least four ACORDE modules <lb/>was implemented in 2012 to record cosmic events during <lb/>proton-proton collisions, and so increase the live time data-<lb/>taking. <lb/>It is interesting to note that three LEP experiments -<lb/>L3, ALEPH and DELPHI-also found an excess of high-<lb/>multiplicity events that were not explained by Monte Carlo <lb/>models. The strategy in ALICE is to detect and study a <lb/>larger number of these events in a more quantitative way to <lb/>understand properly their nature. <lb/>In the literature we can find several proposals for ori-<lb/>gin of those very high multiplicity cosmic muon events <lb/>(muon bundles) . Among others, there exist the hypothesis <lb/>of strangelets (been small percentage of the composition <lb/>of very energetic cosmic rays) interacting with the atmo-<lb/>sphere nuclei[?] , as well as the appearance of muon bun-<lb/>dles because of the creation of quark gluon plasma in in-<lb/>teractions of very energetic cosmic ray iron nuclei with air <lb/>nuclei[?]. Our approach to the understanding of the nature <lb/>of the muon bundles is to compare the measured rate (num-<lb/> Fig. 6: Up: The highest muon bundle recorded in ALICE. <lb/>This event has 276 muon tracks reconstructed in the TPC. <lb/>Down: Spatial distribution of the muon tracks, projected in <lb/>plane x-z. The measured muon density is 18 muon track/ <lb/> m  2 . <lb/>ber of events per unit time) of high cosmic muon recorded <lb/>and reconstructed in ALICE with the rate of hmm produced <lb/>by standard Corsika showers generated by primary cosmics <lb/>rays (pure proton or iron composition) with energies in the <lb/>range of 10 14  − 10 18  eV , reaching the ALICE apparatus. If <lb/>those counting rates are similar we could go in a deeper <lb/>analysis of the development of MC cosmic showers (nucle-<lb/>ar interaction models involved in Corsika, pion/kaon pro-<lb/>duced, etc.) and understand how the muonic part of stan-<lb/>dard extensive muon showers produce such class of events. <lb/>With this purpose in mind, we produced a sample of <lb/>Corsika MC cosmic showers, generated by primary cosmic <lb/>with energy greater than 10 16 eV, composed by either pure <lb/>proton or pure iron atoms. In this way we shall cover <lb/>the lighter and heavier composites of primary cosmics. <lb/>The event sample generated was equivalent to the events <lb/>recorded in ALICE during one year of continue data taking, <lb/>assuming that the shower core hits the Earth surface within <lb/>an area of 205 m  2 . After the propagation of these showers <lb/>into the molasse rock above ALICE, taking into account <lb/>the geometry of the ALICE cavern at P2-LHC (including <lb/>shafts, corridors, rock composition, etc. ), we placed a <lb/>virtual plane (with area of 6m 2 ) at the same depth as the <lb/>upper part of the ALICE-TPC. The hmm events generated <lb/></body>

Right: point in the <lb/>left side of the red vertical line and below the blue horizontal <lb/>line represent events with more than 100 muons arriving to <lb/>ALICE within an zenith angle window of 0  o  − 60  o  degree <lb/>at this level are named MC Toy events. Using the MC <lb/>Toy sample as the input for the standard ALICE event <lb/>reconstruction programming scheme (AliROOT[?]) we <lb/>were able to reconstruct MC hmm events as exactly the <lb/>same was as we do it with real data. We call those event <lb/>as MC AliRoot-TPC reconstructed events. In Figure ?? <lb/> (left) we show the position of the MC extensive air shower <lb/>core as well as the ALICE spectrometer position, at the <lb/>ALICE depth, within the 205m 2 area. In this figure we <lb/>show only the events reaching ALICE with more than 100 <lb/>muon particles arriving in ALICE within an angular zenith <lb/>window of 0  o  − 60  o  degree. Figure ?? (right) show the <lb/>number of particles, per event, in terms of the core distance <lb/>to ALICE. Point on the left side of the vertical red line <lb/>represent events with more than one hundred muons at the <lb/>ALICE depth level. As we expect, in must of the cases the <lb/>nearest core position is associated with maximal number of <lb/>particle multiplicity, The dashed blue line, at 50 m, bound <lb/>the distance between the core and the ALICE spectrometer <lb/>for such events. In Table ?? we present the result of this <lb/>MC analysis, showing in the same table the hmm rate for <lb/>real data. From this table we note that in one year of data <lb/>taking we obtain more than 40 hmm events, either with <lb/>light or heavy primary composite. It means that we can <lb/>generate hmm events with standard MC showers, without <lb/>including any extra ingredient in the nuclear interactions in <lb/>the Corsika code. It is more remarkable that the MC hmm <lb/>event rate, 2.03 × 10  −6  , is comparable to the rate measured <lb/>in ALICE in real data which is 1.77 × 10  −6  Hz. <lb/> Table 1: Number of hmm events recorded in real data and <lb/>MC events (Toy and TPC) <lb/> Sample <lb/>hmm events (Hz) <lb/> Real Data <lb/>1.77 × 10  −6 <lb/> Toy Corsika ( p ) <lb/>1.05 × 10  −6 <lb/> Toy Corsika (Fe) <lb/>1.49 × 10  −6 <lb/> AliRoot-TPC Corsika ( p ) <lb/> − − ×10 −6 <lb/> AliRoot Corsika (Fe) <lb/>2.03 × 10  −6 <lb/> 4 Conclusions <lb/> In the interval of 2010-2013 ALICE Experiment ran a <lb/>32 live time of dedicated cosmic runs, obtaining around <lb/>35 million trigger events. We found 6 events with more <lb/>than 100 reconstructed tracks, reconstructed in the central <lb/>part of the ALICE spectrometer. Comparing the muon <lb/>momentum distribution and the flux of this kind of event <lb/>with the corresponding distribution of Corsika cosmic ray <lb/>showers generate by high energy primary cosmic ray with <lb/>energy in the range of 10 12 -10 18 GeV we were able to <lb/>reproduce the lower multiplicity behaviour (less than 20 <lb/>muons per event) of the muon multiplicity spectrum, finding <lb/>that the light cosmic ray composite with energies in the <lb/>range of 10 12 -10 14 GeV reproduce the lowest multiplicity <lb/>event. As soon as the multiplicity increases, heavier primary <lb/>component fits the real data curve. Using the latest version <lb/>of the Corsika MC cosmic shower generator and standard <lb/>nuclear interaction models (QGSJET01) included this code, <lb/>we found than the measured rate of the highest muon <lb/>multiplicity events recorded in ALICE is comparable with <lb/>rate of this type of events produced in extensive air showers <lb/>generated by high energy cosmic (10 16 -10 18 eV) ray with <lb/>heavy nuclei composition. <lb/></body>
