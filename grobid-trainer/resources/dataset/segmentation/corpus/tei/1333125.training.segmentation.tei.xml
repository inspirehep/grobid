For this, we adopt <lb/>the point of view of Cartan geometries, and rely as well on the work of John Lott, who has <lb/>found a unified geometrical interpretation of the torsion constraints for many supergravity <lb/>theories, based on the use of H-structures. In this framework, the constraints amount to <lb/>requiring first-order integrability of H-structures, for a specific supergroup H. <lb/> The supergroup H used by Lott is not the usual diagonal representation of the Lorentz <lb/>group on superspace, but an extension of the latter. This extension appears to be natural <lb/>and it can be related to the super-Poincaré group. We also observe that the constraints <lb/>arising from the requirement of first-order integrability have basically the same form, in <lb/>any spacetime dimension. <lb/>Looking at supergravity from an affine viewpoint (i.e. as a gauge theory for the <lb/>super-Poincaré group), we show that requiring first-order integrability amounts to <lb/>requiring the equivalence, up to gauge transformations, between infinitesimal gauge <lb/>supertranslations acting on the supervielbein and infinitesimal superdiffeomorphisms <lb/>acting on the supervielbein. <lb/>The latter action is performed through a covariant Lie derivative, whose expression <lb/>involves naturally the supertorsion tensor. We use this expression to show that the term <lb/>added to the spin connection, in the supercovariant derivative of d  =  11 supergravity, has <lb/>a natural superspace origin. In particular, the 4-form field strength is related to a specific <lb/>component of the supertorsion tensor. <lb/>We conclude by some general remarks concerning Killing spinors in geometry and <lb/>supergravity, discussing their possible interpretations, as Killing vector fields on a specific <lb/>supermanifold on one hand, and as parallel spinors for an appropriate connection on the <lb/>other hand. We show that this last interpretation is very natural from the point of view of <lb/>Klein and Cartan geometries. <lb/> ©  2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> By introducing his concept of generalized spaces, Elie Cartan has defined a very general notion of geometry, combining <lb/>Felix Klein&apos;s perspective with the curved manifolds of Bernhard Riemann. One starts first with a Klein geometry  (G,  H) where <lb/> G is a Lie group and H a Lie subgroup of G. The homogeneous space G/H serves as flat model for the geometry of Cartan. If M <lb/> is a smooth manifold, we will define, with Sharpe [1], a Cartan geometry to be a pair  (P, θ )  where P is a principal H-bundle <lb/> over M and  θ  is a  g-valued  one-form on P (g being the Lie algebra of G). The form  θ  , called a Cartan connection, is a connection <lb/></body>

			<body> one-form, but not in the usual sense of Ehresmann (in which case it would have been  h-valued).  In fact,  θ  is required to be <lb/> H-equivariant and to provide the bundle P with a  g-valued  absolute parallelism which extends its canonical vertical <lb/>parallelism. On a Lie group, there exists a canonical Cartan connection: the left-invariant Maurer–Cartan form, whose <lb/>structure equation expresses precisely that the homogeneous model is flat in the sense of Cartan. <lb/>We will assume that a reductive decomposition  g  =  h  ⊕  m  has been chosen once for all. Then the Cartan connection can <lb/>be written as  θ = ω +  e where  ω  is a usual  h-valued  Ehresmann connection one-form on P, and e is a tensorial  m-valued <lb/> one-form on P, called a soldering form. If  V  is the vector bundle over M associated to P by the adjoint action of H on  m,  then <lb/> e provides an isomorphism, also denoted by e, that solders the auxiliary vector bundle  V  to the tangent bundle TM (cf. [2]). <lb/>Let us forget for a moment about the connection  ω,  and let us consider the action of H on  m.  To simplify the discussion, we <lb/>may assume here that this action is faithful, so that we can write H  ⊂  GL(m). Then, seeing P as an H-subbundle of the frame <lb/>bundle  F  r(V) provides the vector bundle  V  with a canonical H-structure. The soldering form e can be used to pull-back this <lb/>auxiliary H-structure to an H-structure on the manifold M. <lb/> Thus, the soldering form appears as an object of central importance: varying it amounts to vary the H-structure on the <lb/>manifold M. We will allow ourselves to write: &apos;&apos;the H-structure  (P,  e) on M&apos;&apos; (instead of: &apos;&apos;the H-structure defined on M by <lb/>pull-back via e of the auxiliary H-structure on  V&apos;&apos;). <lb/> We see that a Cartan geometry on M modelled by  (G,  H) is basically an H-structure  (P,  e) on M (modelled by  (G,  H)) <lb/> with the additional data of a connection  ω. <lb/> It is only recently that these fundamental concepts of Cartan geometries and H-structures have become popular among <lb/>differential geometers (cf. for example [1,3–5]). In [6], Derek Wise shows that gravity can be conceived as a theory where the <lb/>dynamical variable is a Cartan geometry  (P, θ ).  This theory should admit as a particular solution the &apos;&apos;maximally symmetric&apos;&apos; <lb/>homogeneous space G/H on which it is modelled. The Kleinian model appears then as a vacuum state of the theory. <lb/>This approach, based on H-structures and the Cartan point of view on geometry, covers the most important examples <lb/>of gravitational theories (Poincaré, Anti-de Sitter, . . . ). Also, one can replace the manifold M by a supermanifold, the groups <lb/> G and H by super-Lie groups, and expect the resulting Cartan supergeometry to be the natural geometrical framework of <lb/>supergravity theories. One aim of our work is to explore further the relevance of Cartan geometries and H-structures in <lb/>describing supergravity. There is no doubt that the theory of H-structures is particularly useful in supergravity. For example, <lb/>they have been used recently in classifications of backgrounds admitting Killing spinors. On the other hand, in [7], John Lott <lb/>has shown how H-structures can help in understanding the torsion constraints in superspace supergravity, using Spencer <lb/>cohomology groups. In the next section, we recall the main ideas underlying Lott&apos;s approach. In Section 3, we show that <lb/>this framework also provides an interpretation of torsion constraints in 11-dimensional supergravity. In Section 4, we give <lb/>an alternative interpretation of the torsion constraints, as providing an equivalence between two ways of acting on the <lb/>soldering form. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with some remarks concerning Killing spinors and parallel spinors. <lb/> 2. Supergravity and the integrability of H -structures <lb/> We keep the notations of the preceding section, but specialize to the situation where G  =  H  m,  so that  m  is an ideal <lb/>of  g.  To any Cartan geometry  (P, θ )  one can associate the curvature two-form  Ω  =  dω  + ω ∧ ω  and the torsion two-form <lb/> T  =  de  +  e  ∧ ω  (recall that H  ⊂  GL(m), and we are using the usual conventions in supermanifold category so for instance <lb/>we write e  ∧ ω  instead of  ω ∧  e). <lb/> Torsion is a tensor associated with both the connection and the soldering form. However, the dependence of T on the <lb/>connection  ω  is easily controlled. Connections form an infinite-dimensional affine space, whose direction is given by the <lb/>vector space  ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  (P,  h)  of  h-valued  tensorial one-forms on P. Translating the connection  ω  by a vector  β ∈ ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  (P,  h)  has the <lb/>effect of translating the torsion T by the vector e  ∧ β ∈ ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  (P,  m). <lb/> It is convenient to identify, using the soldering form, elements of  ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  (P,  h)  (resp. of  ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  (P,  m))  with H-equivariant <lb/> functions on P valued in Hom(m,  h)  (resp. in Hom(m∧m,  m)).  Then we have a linear map  δ :  Hom(m,  h)  −→  Hom(m∧m,  m) <lb/> which associates to every &apos;&apos;variation of connection&apos;&apos; b a &apos;&apos;variation of torsion&apos;&apos;  δ(b) =  Id  m  ∧  b. Declare two torsion tensors <lb/>equivalent if they differ from each other by a variation of connection. The set of equivalence classes is Hom(m  ∧  m, m)/Imδ. <lb/> It is called the Spencer cohomology group and is denoted by H <lb/> 0,2 <lb/> h  . <lb/>Now take any H-structure  (P,  e), and let T  :  P  −→  Hom(m  ∧  m, m)  be the torsion tensor associated to  (e, ω)  where  ω  is <lb/>an arbitrary connection on P. It is clear that the function C  (e) :  P  −→  H <lb/> 0,2 <lb/> h  defined by C  (e)(p) = [T (p)]  does not depend on <lb/>the choice of the connection  ω.  It is an invariant of the H-structure  (P,  e), called the first-order structure function of  (P,  e). <lb/> We denote by  τ  the restriction to  m  of the Lie bracket of  g.  Consider the trivial H-bundle  <lb/>  =  G  =  m  ×  H, and let <lb/>   be <lb/>the Maurer–Cartan form of G. Then  (  ˚ <lb/> P, ˚ <lb/> θ )  is a Cartan geometry on <lb/>  =  m.  The Maurer–Cartan form splits into a canonical <lb/>connection <lb/>   and a canonical soldering form <lb/> . In particular, we have a canonical H-structure  (  ˚ <lb/> P, ˚ <lb/> e) on <lb/> . <lb/> It is not difficult to compute the first-order structure function of  (  ˚ <lb/> P, ˚ <lb/> e). One can start by computing the torsion of the <lb/>Cartan geometry  (  ˚ <lb/> P, ˚ <lb/> θ ).  Projecting the Maurer–Cartan equation d ˚ <lb/> θ +  ˚ <lb/> θ ∧  ˚ <lb/> θ =  0, one can show that <lb/>  (p) = π  2  (p) <lb/> −1 · τ  , <lb/>where  π  2 is the projection of <lb/>  on the fibre H, and H acts naturally on Hom(m  ∧  m, m)  and its quotient H <lb/> 0,2 <lb/> h  . <lb/>Consequently, C  (  ˚ <lb/> e)(p)  = π  2  (p) <lb/> −1 · [τ ]. <lb/> For example, if H  =  SO <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) and  m  =  R <lb/> d  (with SO <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) acting on  R <lb/> d  in the standard way), then the ideal  m <lb/> is abelian in the Poincaré Lie algebra  g,  and  τ =  0. In this case, C  (  ˚ <lb/> e)  =  0 (the canonical torsion of flat Minkowski spacetime <lb/></body>

			<body> is zero). However, suppose one takes instead H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) and  m  = (R <lb/> d  ⊗  L <lb/> ev <lb/> ) ⊕ (S ⊗  L <lb/> od <lb/> )  where L <lb/> ev (resp. L <lb/> od ) is the <lb/>even (resp. the odd) part of an auxiliary exterior algebra, S is a spin representation of Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d−1,  1) (and Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d−1,  1) acts <lb/>diagonally on  m).  Then the ideal  m  is not abelian in the super-Poincaré Lie algebra  g,  and  τ ̸ =  0. Consequently, C  (  ˚ <lb/> e)(p)  ̸ =  0 <lb/>(the canonical torsion of flat super-Minkowski spacetime is not zero). <lb/>An H-structure  (P,  e) on a manifold M is said to be integrable or locally flat if it is locally isomorphic to the canonical <lb/> H-structure  (  ˚ <lb/> P, ˚ <lb/> e) on <lb/> . If this the case, it is not difficult to prove that  (P,  e) will be in particular first-order integrable. That <lb/>is, for any p  0  ∈  P, there exists an open neighbourhood  U  of  π (p  0  )  in M, and a smooth function h  : π <lb/> −1 <lb/> (U) −→  H such that <lb/> C  (e)(p) =  h(p)  · [τ ]. <lb/> Thus, the failure of C  (e)  to take its values in the H-orbit of  [τ ]  is an obstruction to the integrability of the H-structure <lb/> (P,  e). For example, in ordinary Poincaré gravity (H  =  SO <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) and  m  =  R <lb/> d  ), we have  τ =  0 and H <lb/> 0,2 <lb/> h <lb/> = {0},  so any <lb/> H-structure (Lorentzian metric) on M is automatically first-order integrable (but not integrable of course: that would require <lb/>the vanishing of the curvature as well). Besides, since we will always have T  (p) ∈  Im  δ,  it is always possible to translate the <lb/>connection in a way that eliminates completely the torsion. Taking into account that Ker  δ = {0}  for H  =  SO <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1), we <lb/>see that this connection giving zero torsion is unique. This provides a conceptual proof of the existence and unicity of the <lb/>Levi-Civita connection on Lorentzian (or Riemannian) manifolds. <lb/>Another example is Poincaré supergravity (H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) and  m  = (R <lb/> d  ⊗  L <lb/> ev <lb/> ) ⊕ (S ⊗  L <lb/> od <lb/> ),  so  τ ̸ =  0). Since <lb/>H <lb/> 0,2 <lb/> h <lb/> ̸ = {0},  a given H-structure  (P,  e) on M is not necessarily first-order integrable. Following Lott, we impose this as a <lb/>constraint: the H-structure  (P,  e) associated with a supergravity theory has to be first-order integrable. In other terms, for <lb/>any super-connection  ω, [T (p)] =  h(p)  · [τ ]  for some H-valued function h defined locally (from now on we will be mainly <lb/>dealing with super-objects, but we will avoid writing systematically the prefix &apos;&apos;super&apos;&apos;). <lb/>We see that although the constraint is expressed in terms of torsion, it is in fact a constraint on the H-structure <lb/> (equivalently, using the language of physicists: a constraint on the vielbein e). Now in this case, where H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d−1,  1),  τ <lb/> (and hence  [τ ])  is H-invariant, so we obtain:  [T (p)] = [τ ].  Then we can use the freedom in translating the connection, to <lb/>choose a particular connection for which T  (p) = τ  . In practice, if  (e  m  )  and  (f  a  )  are bases of  R <lb/> d  and S respectively, then <lb/> T  (p) = τ  becomes: <lb/> T <lb/> m <lb/>ab  = τ <lb/> m <lb/>ab  , <lb/> T <lb/> b <lb/>ma  =  0, <lb/> T <lb/> a <lb/>mn  =  0, <lb/> T <lb/> p <lb/>mn  =  0, <lb/> T <lb/> n <lb/>ma  =  0, <lb/> T <lb/> c <lb/>ab  =  0. <lb/>A problem appears if one takes Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) as group H: as shown in [7], these constraints are too stringent; imposing <lb/>first-order integrability for an H-structure with H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) implies that the curvature is zero, so we only get <lb/>flat solutions. To remedy this situation, Lott extended the structural group by taking H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1)  p  where <lb/> p  is a vector subspace of Hom(R <lb/> d <lb/> ,  S), and the action of an element  (σ , µ) ∈  H on an element  (v,  s)  ∈  m  is given by: <lb/> (σ , µ) · (v,  s)  = (σ v, µ(v) + σ  s). Denoting from now on Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1) by H  0 , we have H  0  ⊂  H. The right constraint <lb/>becomes: <lb/>With H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d−1,  1)p, the H-structure  (P,  e) associated with a supergravity theory has to be first-order integrable. <lb/>In other terms, for any connection ñ <lb/> ω <lb/> ′ <lb/> , [ ˜ <lb/> T <lb/> ′ <lb/> (p)] =  h(p)  · [τ ]  for some H-valued function h defined locally. However, with <lb/>this new choice for H,  τ  is not H-invariant. The stabilizer of  τ  is precisely H  0 . We can still use the freedom in translating <lb/>the connection, to choose a particular connection ñ <lb/> ω  for which  <lb/>   (p) =  h(p)  · τ  . Indeed,  ˜ <lb/> T <lb/> ′ <lb/> (p) −  h(p)  · τ ∈  Imδ implies the <lb/>existence of a &apos;&apos;variation of connection&apos;&apos;  β  such that  <lb/> ′ <lb/> (p) −  h(p)  · τ =  e  ∧ β  (here and in the sequel, we drop any distinction <lb/>between elements of  ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  (P,  h)  (resp.  ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  (P,  m))  and H-equivariant functions valued in Hom(m,  h)  (resp. Hom(m  ∧  m, m)). <lb/> Defining  <lb/>  = ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> ′ − β,  the structure equation ñ <lb/> T  =  de  +  e  ∧ ˜ <lb/> ω  gives immediately  <lb/>   (p) =  h(p)  · τ  . <lb/>The following proposition (cf. [8] for a proof) will be useful in Section 4: <lb/> Proposition 2.1. Let e  ∈ ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  (P,  m)  be a soldering form. The following three statements are equivalent: <lb/> 1. The H-structure  (P,  e) on M is first-order integrable. <lb/> 2. For each z  0  ∈  M, there exists an open neighbourhood W of z  0  , and a local cross-section s  :  W  −→  P such that for any <lb/>z  ∈  W  ,  C  (e)(s(z)) = [τ ]. <lb/> 3. For each p  ∈  P, C  (e)(p)  and  [τ ]  are in the same H-orbit. <lb/> One would like to express the constraint also in terms of H  0 -structures, since this is the most common setting in the <lb/>literature. Define P  0  = {p ∈  P/  ˜ <lb/> T  (p) = τ }.  It is not difficult to check that P  0 is a principal H  0 -bundle over M. Let  ι  be the <lb/>canonical injection of P  0 in P. Since  h  =  h  0  ⊕  p,  there exists a unique connection  ω  on P  0 , and a unique tensorial one-form <lb/> α ∈ ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  0 <lb/> (P  0  ,  p)  such that:  ι <lb/>  *  ˜ <lb/> ω = ω + α.  Since  <lb/>   (p) = τ  for each p  ∈  P  0 , we deduce that de  +  e  ∧ ω +  e  ∧ α = τ  on P  0 , that <lb/>is, T  = τ −  e  ∧ α  on P  0 . <lb/>We see that for the super-Lorentzian structure defined by H  0 , the constraint obtained by imposing first-order integrability <lb/>on the extended structure defined by H translate into the existence of a spin connection whose torsion obeys the following <lb/>conditions: <lb/>  <lb/> T <lb/> m  = τ <lb/> m  −  e <lb/> A  ∧ α <lb/> m <lb/>A <lb/> T <lb/> a  = τ <lb/> a  −  e <lb/> A  ∧ α <lb/> a <lb/>A <lb/></body>

These constraints on the torsion are exactly those imposed in d  =  4, N  =  1 superspace <lb/>supergravity (cf. [9]) as well as in d  =  11 superspace supergravity (cf. [10]). In the d  =  4 case, one takes  p  =  Hom(R <lb/> 4 <lb/> ,  S) <lb/> (cf. p. 584 in [7]). <lb/> 3. The 4-form field strength of 11-dimensional supergravity <lb/> As we said before, the constraints presented above are in particular valid for d  =  11 supergravity, on which we focus <lb/>in the remainder of this note. The next task is standard. We make use of these constraints on T together with the Bianchi <lb/>identities to eliminate most of the irreducible parts of each torsion component. In other terms, we are reducing the theory <lb/>to the minimal number of independent superfields needed to describe the special geometries obtained by imposing the <lb/>constraint of first-order integrability. In the case of d  =  11 supergravity, this will lead naturally to the bosonic vielbein and <lb/>the Rarita–Schwinger spinor field, together with a 3-form gauge field A whose 4-form field strength F  =  dA is naturally <lb/>expected to be related to one of the torsion components. We will see below that it is actually the case. Let V  =  R <lb/> 11 , and S a <lb/>real irreducible 32-dimensional spin representation of Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (V ). <lb/> The component T <lb/> b <lb/>ma  of the torsion is particularly interesting. It belongs to the representation V  ⊗  S  ⊗  S of  spin(V  ).  Here, <lb/>and often in the following, we will identify V and S with their duals, using respectively the Lorentz metric in V and the <lb/>invariant symplectic form in S. We want to write the decomposition of V  ⊗  S  ⊗  S into irreducible representations of  spin(V  ). <lb/> Let <lb/>   k,1 V  = {t ∈ <lb/>   k V  ⊗  V  /t  [m  1  ,...,m  k n]  =  0 and t <lb/> m <lb/>m  1  ,...,m  k−1 m  =  0}. This is the irreducible representation of highest <lb/>weight  ε  1  + ε  k  .

			<body> 4. The affine point of view <lb/> In this section, we will start by showing that the constraints on the torsion tensor can be understood conceptually as a <lb/>condition ensuring the equivalence between the action of infinitesimal super-diffeomorphisms on the soldering form and <lb/>that of infinitesimal gauge super-translations. <lb/>Let G  =  m  H where  m  =  R <lb/> d  ⊕  S and H  =  Spin <lb/> ↑ <lb/> (d −  1, 1)  p.  We can think of G as a generalized super-Poincaré group. <lb/>There exists a natural extension of the H-bundle P to a G-bundle Q . Let  ι :  P  ↩→  Q the natural inclusion. We can restrict our <lb/>attention to the connections  ˘ <lb/> ω  on Q for which the splitting  ι <lb/>  *  ˘ <lb/> ω = ˜ <lb/> ω +  e (according to  g  =  h  ⊕  m)  is such that e is indeed an <lb/>isomorphism. Those &apos;&apos;affine&apos;&apos; connections on Q are in one-to-one correspondence with Cartan connections  θ  on P (cf. [1]). <lb/>An infinitesimal gauge transformation  ˘ <lb/> Λ  of Q acts on  ˘ <lb/> ω  as usual:  δ  ˘ <lb/> Λ  ˘ <lb/> ω =  D <lb/> ˘ <lb/> ω  ˘ <lb/> Λ  =  d  ˘ <lb/> Λ  + [ ˘ <lb/> Λ,  ˘ <lb/> ω].  It is natural to split <lb/> ˘ <lb/> Λ  according to  g  =  h  ⊕  m  as follows:  ι <lb/>  *  ˘ <lb/> Λ  =  Λ  + ξ  where  Λ  is an infinitesimal gauge transformation of P and  ξ  is an <lb/>infinitesimal gauge &apos;&apos;translation&apos;&apos;. The action on  ι <lb/>  *  ˘ <lb/> ω = ˜ <lb/> ω +  e splits accordingly: <lb/>  δ  ˘ <lb/> Λ  e  = [ξ ,  e]  +  D <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ + [Λ,  e] <lb/> δ  ˘ <lb/> Λ  ˜ <lb/> ω =  D <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω Λ. <lb/> We can consider two particular cases: <lb/> •  Action of  ξ  alone (Λ  =  0): <lb/>  δ ξ  e  = [ξ ,  e]  +  D <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ <lb/>δ ξ  ˜ <lb/> ω =  0. <lb/> •  Action of  Λ  alone (ξ  =  0): <lb/>  δ Λ  e  = [Λ,  e] <lb/> δ Λ  ˜ <lb/> ω =  D <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω Λ. <lb/> Notice that since the Lie bracket  τ = [, ]  appearing in the action on e is not H-invariant, it is clear that this action is <lb/>not covariant under H. In other terms,  δ ξ  e  = [ξ ,  e]  +  D <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ  is invariant only under gauge transformations for the group H  0 . <lb/>Moreover, this action of the gauge translations on e is  <lb/> -dependent.  On the other hand, there is a natural way to make <lb/>infinitesimal diffeomorphisms (i.e. vector fields) act on e (also in an ñ <lb/> ω-dependent  way). This is performed through the <lb/> covariant Lie derivative defined below: <lb/> Definition 4.1. To each connection ñ <lb/> ω  on P, we may associate a Lie derivative acting on the sections of  V,  and on the elements <lb/>of  Λ <lb/> k <lb/> (M,  V).  It is the covariant Lie derivative  L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω  , defined for each X  ∈  Γ (TM)  by: <lb/> L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X  Φ  = ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X  Φ,  for any  Φ  ∈  Γ (V) <lb/>(L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X a)(Y  ) = ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X  (a(Y )) −  a([X  ,  Y  ]),  for any a  ∈  Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> (M,  V)(and  Y  ∈  Γ (TM)). <lb/> One can easily show the following Cartan formula for the covariant Lie derivative: for every X  ∈  Γ (TM),  we have: <lb/> L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X  =  i X  ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω  i X  . <lb/> Taking a to be the soldering form e, we deduce that: <lb/> L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X e  =  i X  ˜ <lb/> T  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> (e(X)). <lb/> Unlike the action of the translation gauge algebra on e, the action of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms on e through the <lb/>covariant Lie derivative is fully covariant under H. In other terms,  L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X e  =  i X  ˜ <lb/> T  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> (e(X))  is invariant under gauge <lb/>transformations for the whole group H. <lb/> Theorem 4.2. Let e  ∈ ¯ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> H  (P,  m)  be a soldering form,  ˜ <lb/> ω  a connection on P, and  <lb/>  the torsion of the pair  (e, ˜ <lb/> ω).  There is an <lb/>equivalence between infinitesimal gauge translations acting on e and infinitesimal diffeomorphisms acting on e, if and only if <lb/>   = τ  . <lb/> Proof. Let  ξ ∈  Γ (V).  We set X  =  e <lb/> −1 <lb/> (ξ ) ∈  Γ (TM).  Then: <lb/> δ ξ  e  =  L <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> X e  ⇐⇒ [ξ ,  e]  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ =  i X  ˜ <lb/> T  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> (e(X)) ⇐⇒ [ξ ,  e]  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ =  i X  ˜ <lb/> T  + ∇ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ω <lb/> (ξ ) ⇐⇒ [ξ ,  e]  =  i X  ˜ <lb/> T  ⇐⇒ [ξ ,  e(Y  )] = <lb/> (i  X  ˜ <lb/> T  )(Y ) ⇐⇒ [e(X),  e(Y  )] = ˜ <lb/> T  (X,  Y  ) ⇐⇒ τ = ˜ <lb/> T .  <lb/> We have seen in Section 2 the first-order integrability of the H-structure  (P,  e) on M is characterized by the existence <lb/>of a connection ñ <lb/> ω  and a smooth function h  :  P  −→  H defined locally, such that the torsion ñ <lb/> T associated with  (e, ˜ <lb/> ω) <lb/> satisfies  <lb/>   (p) =  h(p)  · τ  . But the assertion 2. of Proposition 2.1 implies the existence of a gauge in which the preceding <lb/>condition is given by:  ˜ <lb/> T  = τ  . We deduce that the equivalence between infinitesimal gauge supertranslations acting on e <lb/> and infinitesimal super-diffeomorphisms acting on e holds up to gauge transformations for the group H, provided that the <lb/></body>

			<body> H-structure  (P,  e) on M is first-order integrable. The gauge-dependence of this result is natural since the action of <lb/>infinitesimal gauge translations is not covariant under H while the action of infinitesimal diffeomorphisms is fully covariant. <lb/>At the end of the preceding section, we have seen that the supercovariant derivative of d  =  11 supergravity can be re-<lb/>expressed in terms of the torsion tensor. The appearance of torsion at this level is not a coincidence and is not particular to <lb/>the d  =  11 case. Using the covariant Lie derivative seen above, we prove the following: <lb/> Theorem 4.3. In any supergravity theory, the supercovariant derivative has the following generic form:  D  µ ε = ∇  µ ε −  T  µ ε. <lb/> Proof. Consider a vector field X , and denote by  ξ =  e(X  )  the associated gauge translation. We know that: <lb/> L <lb/> ω <lb/> X e  =  i X T  + ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ . <lb/> In particular, <lb/> (L <lb/> ω <lb/> X e)(∂ M  ) = (i  X T  )(∂  M  ) + (∇ <lb/> ω <lb/> ξ )(∂  M  ) <lb/> =  T  (X, ∂  M  ) + ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/> M  ξ <lb/> = −(−1) <lb/> |X| |M|  T  (∂  M  ,  X  ) + ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/> M  ξ <lb/> = −(−1) <lb/> |X| |M| <lb/> (ι ∂  M T  )(X) + ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/> M  ξ . <lb/> Thus, <lb/> (δ  X e) M  = ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/> M  ξ − (−1) <lb/> |X| |M|  T M  (X). <lb/> In particular, <lb/> (δ  X e)  µ  = ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/>µ ξ −  T  µ (X). <lb/> We deduce, at the level of the component fields and transformations  ψ <lb/> a <lb/> µ (x) =  e <lb/> a <lb/> µ (x, θ =  0) and  ε <lb/> a <lb/> (x) = ξ <lb/> a <lb/> (x, θ =  0), that: <lb/> D  µ ε = (δ ε ψ) µ  = ∇ <lb/> ω <lb/>µ ε −  T  µ ε <lb/> in agreement with what we found in the preceding section.  <lb/> 5. Conclusion and perspectives <lb/> We have shown that the use of Cartan geometries and Lott&apos;s approach through H-structures applies for 11-dimensional <lb/>supergravity as well, and leads naturally to the 4-form field strength F  =  dA (and to the fact that the 3-form A is entirely <lb/>contained in the supervielbein). Besides, we have explored two different ways of transforming the supervielbein, proving <lb/>the existence of a gauge where the two ways coincide if the torsion constraint is satisfied. <lb/>Also, we have shown that the somehow complicated expression of the supercovariant derivative  D  in d  =  11 <lb/>supergravity becomes simple and natural when we relate it to its superspace origin: the action of infinitesimal <lb/>superdiffeomorphisms on the supervielbein, that is, on the H-structure. Existence of non-trivial elements in the kernel of  D <lb/> is simply the existence of supersymmetries of the background, in other terms, existence of automorphisms of H-structures. <lb/> Going to superspace, we expect this to translate into existence of parallel sections on some adjoint bundle in super-Lie <lb/>algebras (the bundle whose sections are &apos;&apos;the symmetries of the theory&apos;&apos;, forming an infinite-dimensional vector space; <lb/>among these sections, the parallel ones are &apos;&apos;the symmetries of a solution&apos;&apos; and they form a finite-dimensional subspace, <lb/>having at most the dimension of the algebra, which is attained in the parallelizable case). Of course, one needs a specific <lb/>superconnection on this bundle to state the existence of H-structure automorphisms in terms of parallel sections. <lb/>Another way to express the supersymmetry of a background is in terms of Killing super-vector fields, by a condition of the <lb/>type &apos;&apos;Lie derivative equal to zero&apos;&apos; (in superspace). To our knowledge, this is not done yet for 11-dimensional supergravity. <lb/>It is done in the simpler situation of a spin manifold M equipped with a metric g and a parallel symplectic form b on the <lb/>bundle of spinors  S  (endowed with the spin connection). In [13], the authors associate to the pair  (M,  S)  a supermanifold <lb/>in the usual way, and to the data  (g,  b) an H-structure on this supermanifold, where H  ≃  spin(V  ) ⊕  S (H is nothing but <lb/>the super-Poincaré group in its standard representation on superspace; the action of V is killed since it is abelian). Then, <lb/>they prove that Killing spinors on M (in the usual sense) correspond to odd Killing super-vector fields for this H-structure <lb/> associated to  (g,  b). <lb/> It is not difficult to see that the supergroup H used in [13] belongs to the class of extended supergroups defined by Lott, <lb/>if we take  p  to be a subspace isomorphic to S. This class appears therefore to be natural, as claimed in the introduction. We <lb/>did not investigate yet the consequence of choosing  p  ≃  S in the context of supergravity. It might be that this choice is too <lb/>restrictive and leads only to flat solutions. <lb/>Returning to Killing spinors, and restricting to the usual type (with a Killing constant  α),  it is known that in some cases the <lb/>Killing spinor equation can be reformulated as a parallel spinor condition. This approach was initiated for real  α  by Christian <lb/>Bär; in [14], he achieves the classification by extending the connection to  spin(n  +  1)  =  spin(n)  ⊕ <lb/> ′  R <lb/> n  . This time, the action <lb/>of V  =  R <lb/> n  on S is not killed, contrary to the case of the super-Poincaré algebra. At the same time,  R <lb/> n  is not an ideal anymore <lb/></body>

			<body> (in  g  =  spin(n  +  1)), so G  =  Spin(n  +  1) does not act on  R <lb/> n  . It would rather act on the (n  +  1)-dimensional metric cone, but <lb/>let us make it act on the sphere S <lb/> n  =  Spin(n  +  1)/Spin(n). With the point of view of Cartan geometries, the picture becomes <lb/>very clear: <lb/>Killing spinors are always parallel spinors in disguise, provided we select the appropriate flat model  (G,  H) for the theory, <lb/>and modify the spin connection into an appropriate Cartan connection. Then  α  is related to the cosmological constant, and <lb/>thus to the radius of the flat model G/H. Ordinary parallel spinors (α  =  0) correspond to taking the Euclidean space as Klein <lb/>model. The other equations (for  α ∈  R <lb/>  *  or  α ∈  iR) are also parallel spinor equations, but to see it one has to take the model <lb/>that corresponds naturally to the problem (sphere or hyperbolic space in the Euclidean signature, de Sitter or Anti-de Sitter <lb/>in the Lorentzian signature). Killing spinor equations of supergravity are usually more complicated, but going to superspace <lb/>makes them much clearer, as we have seen in this note. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore Cartan geometries in <lb/>superspace. <lb/>On the other hand, a deep geometrical understanding of d  =  11 supergravity, in particular of the supercovariant <lb/>derivative and its holonomy, is highly desirable in view of the classification of M-theory backgrounds preserving a certain <lb/>amount of supersymmetry (cf. [15] for instance). From this perspective, the results announced in this note support our belief <lb/>that a proper superspace formulation of d  =  11 supergravity, in terms of H-structures and Cartan generalized spaces (with <lb/>their analogs in the category of supermanifolds), is necessary. Such a formulation, with a more detailed exposition of several <lb/>ideas outlined here, will be the object of a subsequent paper. <lb/></body>
