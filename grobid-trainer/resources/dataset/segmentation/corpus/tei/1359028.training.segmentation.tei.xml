			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> The <lb/> 15 C nucleus is a neutron rich system which has stimulated an increasing interest in <lb/>the years (see [1-3] and reference therein). The low lying states with positive parity <lb/>can be described within the 1p-2h space, i.e. a sd-shell neutron coupled to the <lb/> 14 <lb/> C <lb/>ground state. Differently for the negative parity states, where the 2p-3h space with the <lb/>inclusion of the supplemental hole in the p-shell, is necessary. A detailed study of both <lb/>kind of excitation has been done in the past by transfer reactions [1-2]. In addition a <lb/>clear evidence of the effect of the core polarisation has been found by charge <lb/>exchange reactions by the appearance of Fano resonances at about 8.4 MeV excitation <lb/>energy [3]. With the present we want to present a new attempt to study the <lb/> 15 <lb/> C spectra <lb/>by the use of the ( <lb/> 18 O, <lb/> 16 <lb/> O) transfer reaction at 84 MeV. At this incident energy (i.e. <lb/>about 7.5 times the Coulomb barrier) the angular distributions of multi nucleon <lb/>transfer reactions are sensitive to the details of the final populated states [4-5]. In <lb/>addition, according to the Brink&apos;s energy and angular momentum matching conditions <lb/>[6], one expects to excite significantly states with L = 0, 2 and 4. <lb/></body>

			<body> THE EXPERIMENT <lb/> The experiment has been performed in two steps, first in January 2008 and after in <lb/>March 2009, at the INFN-LNS Laboratory of Catania. In the first run a restricted <lb/>angular range between 18° and 40° in the CM reference frame was covered. In the <lb/>second such range was enlarged between 9° to 50° and a supplemental target of <lb/> 12 C <lb/>was used. In this manuscript we refer to the first run, being the analysis of the second <lb/>still under way. <lb/>The <lb/> 18 O beam bombarded a 140 µg/cm <lb/> 2 self supporting <lb/> 13 C target at 84 MeV incident <lb/>energy. The Oxygen isotopes produced in the collisions were detected by the <lb/>MAGNEX spectrometer with the purpose to study the structure of <lb/> 14 C, <lb/> 15 <lb/> C and <lb/> 16 <lb/> C <lb/>nuclei via the ( <lb/> 18 O, <lb/> 17,16,15 <lb/> O) multi-neutron transfer reactions. The magnetic fields were <lb/>set in order to accept the Oxygen ions with charge between 6 <lb/> + to 8 <lb/> + at the maximum <lb/>kinetic energy. These were identified by the simultaneous measurement of their <lb/>position along the focal plane and their residual energy on the silicon detector <lb/>hodoscope. In Fig.1 an example of the capabilities of the instrument to identify the <lb/>ejectiles is shown for this reaction. This result indicates that, for many cases the <lb/>particle identification can be successfully obtained without the standard measurement <lb/>of the time of flight as discussed in ref. [7]. <lb/> FIGURE 1. In the left panel the measured energy loss is shown versus the kinetic energy. Different <lb/>ions are identified by comparison with loci expected from kinematics and energy loss calculations. The <lb/>selection condition for the Oxygen ions is also drawn. In the right panel the focal plane position is <lb/>correlated with the kinetic energy for the gated Oxygen ions. Different isotopes and charge states are <lb/>identified. The selection condition for the <lb/> 16 O <lb/> 8+ ions is also drawn. <lb/></body>

			<body> excitation energy. These indicate the population of discrete states and narrow <lb/>resonances of the <lb/> 15 C. One should also note the obtained independence of the <lb/>reconstructed excitation energy from the scattering angle. By projecting the same data <lb/>on the abscissa, as done in Fig.3, one gets a closer inspection of the energy of these <lb/>states. Several peaks are recognized as due to transitions to known states of <lb/> 15 <lb/> C, <lb/>namely the ground and states at excitation energy of 0.74, 3.1, 4.22, 4.66, 6.84 and <lb/>7.35 MeV. Deviations between the measured energies and the known ones are within <lb/>30 keV. Two broad resonances are observed with energies centered at about 11.4 and <lb/>13.5 MeV and FWHM of 2 and 2.5 MeV, respectively. These are unknown from <lb/>literature and represent an interesting result of the experiment. <lb/> FIGURE 2. Bi-dimensional spectrum of the reconstructed laboratory angle versus the reconstructed <lb/> 15 C <lb/>excitation energy for the selected <lb/> 16 O <lb/> 8+ ions , in the angular range 0.174 &lt; θ  lab  &lt; 0.189 rad. <lb/> After gating on the <lb/> 16 O <lb/> 8+ ejectiles, the horizontal and vertical positions and angles <lb/>at the focal plane are analyzed, thus providing the constraints for the application of the <lb/>high order algorithms of trajectory reconstruction, implemented in the spectrometer <lb/>(see [7-8] and reference therein). This procedure does allow for the reconstruction of <lb/>interesting physical quantities like the scattering angle and the excitation energy of the <lb/>target residual. An example of bi-dimensional histogram correlating these quantities is <lb/>shown if Fig.2. In the plot several vertical lines are evident, especially at low <lb/></body>

			<body> FIGURE 3. One-dimensional spectrum of the reconstructed <lb/> 15 <lb/> C excitation energy for the selected <lb/> 16 O <lb/> 8+ <lb/> ions , in the angular range 7.2° &lt; θ  lab  &lt; 13.4°. The solid line is only intended to guide the eye. <lb/> In Fig.4a the angular distributions of the resonance at 11.4 MeV is compared with that <lb/>of the 1/2 <lb/> - resonance at 3.03 MeV, which is almost a pure L = 0 transition from the <lb/>1/2 <lb/> -13 C ground state [1-2]. Similarly in Fig.4b the same comparison is done with the <lb/>angular distribution for the L = 3 transition to the 5/2 <lb/> + bound state at 0.74 MeV. A <lb/>similar behavior is observed between the transition to the 11.4 MeV resonance and the <lb/> L = 0 one, while deviations are observed with the L = 3 one, at least as regards the <lb/>slope of the curves. Similar deviations are observed in the comparison with the L = 4 <lb/>transitions to the 7/2 <lb/> -<lb/> , 9/2 <lb/> - states at 6.84 and 7.35 MeV. As regards the resonance at <lb/>13.5 MeV it behaves exactly as the one at 11.4 MeV, thus indicating that perhaps the <lb/>physical origin of these modes is the same. Taking all of this into account one can <lb/>infer that the L = 0 transfer seems to be the most likely angular momentum transfer for <lb/>the population of the resonances at 11.4 and 13.5 MeV. <lb/> 13 C( <lb/> 18 O, <lb/> 16 O) <lb/> 15 C <lb/> E  inc  = 84 MeV <lb/>7.2° &lt;  θ  lab  &lt;13.4° <lb/></body>

			<body> FIGURE 4. a) Comparison of the measured angular distributions for the transition to the resonance at <lb/> E  x  = 11.45 MeV and at E x  = 3.103 MeV (L = 0). b) Comparison of the measured angular distributions <lb/>for the transition to the resonance at E x  = 11.45 MeV and to the bound state at E x  = 0.74 MeV (L = 3). <lb/> It is also interesting to note in Fig.4a that the cross section for the resonances at <lb/>11.4 and 13.5 MeV are about one order of magnitude larger than that at 3.1 MeV, <lb/>clearly showing that a large amount of the L = 0 strength is exhausted in the former. <lb/>Since the state at 3.1 MeV is an almost pure 2p-1h state, one can conclude about the <lb/>collective nature of these resonances. <lb/>To summarize the dominance of the two neutron transfer mechanism compared to <lb/>the single neutron transfer has been observed. This indicates the dominance of the pair <lb/>transfer compared to the second order process of uncorrelated transfer of two neutrons <lb/>in such experimental conditions. In addition it looks like that a collective degree of <lb/>freedom has been stimulated by the pair transfer mechanism. The preliminary analysis <lb/></body>
