The spectra show several known low lying states up to about 7 MeV <lb/>excitation energy as well as two unknown resonant structures at about 11.4 <lb/>and 13.5 MeV. The strong excitation of these latter together with the <lb/>measured width of about 2 MeV FWHM could indicate the presence of <lb/>collective modes of excitation connected to the transfer of a correlated <lb/>neutron pair. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 <lb/>Introduction <lb/> The <lb/> 15 C nucleus is a neutron rich system which has stimulated an increasing spectroscopic interest in <lb/>the years (see [1-3] and reference therein). A simple representation of the low lying states with <lb/>positive parity can be established within the 1p-2h space, i.e. a sd-shell neutron coupled to the <lb/> 14 C <lb/>ground state. Differently for the negative parity states, where the 2p-3h space with the inclusion of the <lb/>supplemental hole in the p-shell, is necessary. A detailed study of both kind of excitation has been <lb/>done in the past by transfer reactions [1-2]. In addition a clear evidence of the effect of the core <lb/>polarisation has been found in charge exchange reactions by the appearance of Fano resonances at <lb/>about 8.4 MeV excitation energy [3]. With the present we want to present a new attempt to study the <lb/> 15 C spectra by the use of the ( <lb/> 18 O, <lb/> 16 O) transfer reaction at 84 MeV. It is known that, at incident <lb/>energies about 7.5 times the Coulomb barrier the angular distributions of multi nucleon transfer <lb/>reactions are sensitive to the details of the final populated states [4-5]. In addition under these <lb/>conditions, according to the Brink&apos;s energy and angular momentum matching conditions [6], one <lb/>expects to excite significantly states with L = 0, 2 and 4. <lb/> 2 <lb/>The experiment <lb/> The experiment has been performed in two steps, first in January 2008 and after in March 2009, at the <lb/>INFN-LNS Laboratory of Catania. In the first run a restricted angular range between 18° and 40° in <lb/>the CM reference frame was covered. In the second such range was enlarged between 9° to 50° and a <lb/></body>

			<body> supplemental target of <lb/> 12 C was used. In this manuscript we refer to the first run, being the analysis of <lb/>the second still under way. <lb/>The <lb/> 18 O beam bombarded a 140 g/cm <lb/> 2 self supporting <lb/> 13 C target at 84 MeV incident energy. The <lb/>Oxygen isotopes produced in the collisions were detected by the MAGNEX spectrometer with the <lb/>purpose to study the structure of <lb/> 14 C, <lb/> 15 C and <lb/> 16 C nuclei via the ( <lb/> 18 O, <lb/> 17,16,15 O) multi-neutron transfer <lb/>reactions. The magnetic fields were set in order to accept the Oxygen ions with charge between 6 <lb/> + to <lb/>8 <lb/> + at the maximum kinetic energy. These were identified by the simultaneous measurement of their <lb/>position along the focal plane and their residual energy on the silicon detector hodoscope. In Fig.1 an <lb/>example of the capabilities of the instrument to identify the ejectiles is shown for this reaction. This <lb/>result indicates that, for many cases the particle identification can be successfully obtained without the <lb/>standard measurement of the time of flight as discussed in ref. [7]. <lb/>Fig.1: In the left panel the measured energy loss is shown versus the kinetic energy. Different <lb/>ions are identified by comparison with loci expected from kinematics and energy loss calculations. <lb/>The selection condition for the Oxygen ions is also drawn. In the right panel the focal plane position is <lb/>correlated with the kinetic energy for the gated Oxygen ions. Different isotopes and charge states are <lb/>identified. The selection condition for the <lb/> 16 O <lb/> 8+ ions is also drawn. <lb/>After gating on the <lb/> 16 O <lb/> 8+ ejectiles, the horizontal and vertical positions and angles at the focal <lb/>plane are analyzed, thus providing the constraints for the application of the high order algorithms of <lb/>trajectory reconstruction, implemented in the spectrometer ( see [7-8] and reference therein). This <lb/>procedure does allow for the reconstruction of interesting physical quantities like the scattering angle <lb/>and the excitation energy of the target residual. An example of bi-dimensional histogram correlating <lb/>these quantities is shown if Fig.2. In the plot several vertical lines are evident, especially at low <lb/>excitation energy. These indicate the population of discrete states and narrow resonances of the <lb/> 15 C. <lb/>One should also note the obtained independence of the reconstructed excitation energy from the <lb/>scattering angle. By projecting the same data on the abscissa, as done in Fig.3, one gets a closer <lb/>inspection of the energy of these states. Several peaks are recognized as due to transitions to known <lb/>states of <lb/> 15 C, namely the ground and states at excitation energy of 0.74, 3.1, 4.22, 4.66, 6.84 and 7.35 <lb/>MeV. Deviations between the measured energies and the known ones are within 30 keV. Two broad <lb/>resonances are observed with energies centered at about 11.4 and 13.5 MeV and FWHM of 2 and 2.5 <lb/>MeV, respectively. These are unknown from literature and represent an interesting result of the <lb/>experiment. <lb/></body>

			<body> In Fig.4a the angular distributions of the resonance at 11.4 MeV is compared with that of the 1/2 <lb/> -<lb/> resonance at 3.03 MeV, which is almost a pure L = 0 transition from the 1/2 <lb/> -13 C ground state [1-2]. <lb/>Similarly in Fig.4b the same comparison is done with the angular distribution for the L = 3 transition <lb/>to the 5/2 <lb/> + bound state at 0.74 MeV. A similar behavior is observed between the transition to the 11.4 <lb/>MeV resonance and the L = 0 one, while deviations are observed with the L = 3 one, at least as regards <lb/>the slope of the curves. Similar deviations are observed in the comparison with the L = 4 transitions to <lb/>the 7/2 <lb/> - ,9/2 <lb/> - states at 6.84 and 7.35 MeV. As regards the resonance at 13.5 MeV it behaves exactly as <lb/>the one at 11.4 MeV, thus indicating that perhaps the physical origin of these modes is the same. <lb/>Taking all of this into account one can infer that the L = 0 transfer seems to be the most likely angular <lb/>momentum transfer for the population of the resonances at 11.4 and 13.5 MeV. <lb/> Fig.4: a) Comparison of the measured angular distributions for the transition to the resonance at E x  = <lb/>11.45 MeV and at E x  = 3.103 MeV (L = 0). b) Comparison of the measured angular distributions for the <lb/>transition to the resonance at E x  = 11.45 MeV and to the bound state at E x  = 0.74 MeV (L = 3). <lb/></body>

			<body> It is also interesting to note in Fig.4a that the cross section for the resonances at 11.4 and 13.5 <lb/>MeV are about one order of magnitude larger than that at 3.1 MeV, clearly showing that a large <lb/>amount of the L = 0 strength is exhausted in the former. Since the state at 3.1 MeV is an almost pure <lb/>2p-1h state, one can conclude about the collective nature of these resonances. <lb/>To summarize the dominance of the two neutron transfer mechanism compared to the single <lb/>neutron transfer has been observed. This indicates the dominance of the pair transfer compared to the <lb/>second order process of uncorrelated transfer of two neutrons in such experimental conditions. In <lb/>addition it looks like that a collective degree of freedom has been stimulated by the pair transfer <lb/>mechanism. The preliminary analysis of the data of the second experiment seems to confirm all of the <lb/>main features discussed in this manuscript. <lb/></body>
