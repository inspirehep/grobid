The peculiarity of the Eckart potential problem on H <lb/> 2 <lb/> +  (the upper sheet of the <lb/>two-sheeted two-dimensional hyperboloid), to preserve the (2l + 1)-fold degeneracy of the <lb/>states typical for the geodesic motion there, is usually explained in casting the respective <lb/>Hamiltonian in terms of the Casimir invariant of an so(2,1) algebra, referred to as potential <lb/>algebra. In general, there are many possible similarity transformations of the symmetry <lb/>algebras of the free motions on curved surfaces towards potential algebras, which are not <lb/>all necessarily unitary. In the literature, a transformation of the symmetry algebra of the <lb/>geodesic motion on H <lb/> 2 <lb/>+  towards the potential algebra of Eckart&apos;s Hamiltonian has been <lb/>constructed for the prime purpose to prove that the Eckart interaction belongs to the class <lb/>of Natanzon potentials. We here take a different path and search for a transformation <lb/>which connects the (2l +1) dimensional representation space of the pseudo-rotational so(2,1) <lb/>algebra, spanned by the rank-l pseudo-spherical harmonics, to the representation space of <lb/>equal dimension of the potential algebra and find a transformation of the scaling type. Our <lb/>case is that in so doing one is producing a deformed isometry copy to H <lb/> 2 <lb/>+  such that the <lb/>free motion on the copy is equivalent to a motion on H <lb/> 2 <lb/>+  , perturbed by a coth interaction. <lb/>In this way, we link the so(2,1) potential algebra concept of the Eckart Hamiltonian to <lb/>a subtle type of pseudo-rotational symmetry breaking through H <lb/> 2 <lb/>+  metric deformation. <lb/>From a technical point of view, the results reported here are obtained by virtue of certain <lb/>nonlinear finite expansions of Jacobi polynomials into pseudo-spherical harmonics. In due <lb/>places, the pseudo-rotational case is paralleled by its so(3) compact analogue, the cotangent <lb/>perturbed motion on S <lb/> 2  . We expect awareness of different so(2,1)/so(3) isometry copies to <lb/>benefit simulation studies on curved manifolds of many-body systems. <lb/> Key words: pseudo-rotational symmetry; Eckart potential; symmetry breaking through met-<lb/>ric deformation <lb/> 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 47E05; 81R40 <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> Group theoretical approaches to bound state problems in physics have played a pivotal róle in <lb/>our understanding of spectra classifications. It is a well known fact, that several of the exactly <lb/>solvable quantum mechanical potentials give rise to spectra which fall into the irreducible repre-<lb/>sentations of certain Lie groups. As a representative case, we wish to mention the widely studied <lb/>class of Natanzon potentials [1] known to produce spectra that populate multiplets of the pseudo-<lb/>rotational algebras so(2,2)/so(2,1). This phenomenon has been well understood in casting the <lb/>Hamiltonians of the potentials under consideration as Casimir invariants of so(2,2)/so(2,1) alge-<lb/>bras in representations not necessarily unitarily equivalent to the pseudo-rotational and referred <lb/> arXiv:1112.2333v2  [math-ph] 24 Dec 2011 <lb/></body>

			<body>to as &quot; potential algebras &quot; [2, 3]. One popular representative of the Natanzon class potentials <lb/>is the Eckart potential, suggested by Manning and Rosen [4] for the description of the vibra-<lb/>tional modes of diatomic molecules. Its so(2,2)/so(2,1) potential algebras have been constructed, <lb/>among others, in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. One can start with considering the Eckart potential on H  2  , <lb/>the two-sheeted 2D hyperbolic surface, defined as <lb/> H <lb/> 2 <lb/> ±  : z <lb/> 2  − x <lb/> 2  − y <lb/> 2  = R <lb/> 2  , <lb/> where R is a constant. This geometry has been studied in great detail [11], and finds applications, <lb/>among others, as a coherent state manifold [12, 13]. One usually chooses the upper sheet H  2 <lb/>+  , <lb/>which corresponds to the following parametrization in global coordinates <lb/> z = R cosh η, <lb/>x = R sinh η cos ϕ, <lb/>y = R sinh η sin ϕ, <lb/>z &gt; <lb/> x  2  + y  2  , <lb/>η ∈ [0, ∞). <lb/> The free geodesic motion on H  2 <lb/>+  is now determined by the eigenvalue problem of the squared <lb/>pseudo-angular momentum operator C <lb/>HY <lb/> m <lb/> l  (η, ϕ) = − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> l(l + 1)Y <lb/> m <lb/>l  (η, ϕ), <lb/> H = − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> C, <lb/>C = <lb/>1 <lb/>sinh η <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂η <lb/> sinh η <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂η <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>sinh <lb/> 2  η <lb/>∂  2 <lb/> ∂ϕ  2  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>so that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, H, is so(2,1). Here, Y  m <lb/>l  (η, ϕ) are the standard pseudo-<lb/>spherical harmonics [14] <lb/> Y <lb/> m <lb/>l  (η, ϕ) = P <lb/> m <lb/>l  (cosh η)e <lb/> imϕ  , <lb/>η ∈ (−∞, +∞), <lb/>(2) <lb/>with P  m <lb/>l  (cosh η) being the associated Legendre functions of a hyperbolic cosines argument. In [9] <lb/>it has been shown that the following particular similarity transformation of C <lb/> F(η)CF <lb/> −1  (η) = <lb/> C, <lb/> F(η) = <lb/> sinh 2g(r) <lb/> g   (r) <lb/> , <lb/> tanh <lb/> 2  g(r) = z = e <lb/> −r  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>transforms equation (1) into a Natanzon equation in the z variable, and to the central Eckart <lb/>potential problem in ordinary 3D flat position space in the r variable. In this fashion it became <lb/>possible to cast the Schrödinger Hamilton operator with the Eckart potential, treated as a central <lb/>interaction, in the form of a particular Casimir invariant of the so(2,1) algebra. <lb/>Compared to [5], and [9], we here exclusively focus on the relationship between the free, and <lb/>the coth η perturbed motions on H  2 <lb/>+  and find a transformation that connects the (C +2b coth η)-<lb/> and C-eigenvalue problems and their respective invariant spaces, a transformation which has not <lb/>been reported in the literature so far. The C invariant spaces are (2l + 1)-dimensional, non-<lb/>unitary, and spanned by the pseudo-spherical harmonics in (2). Towards our goal, we develop <lb/>a technique for solving the (C + 2b coth η)-eigenvalue problem which slightly differs from the one <lb/>of standard use. Ordinarily, the respective 1D Schrödinger equation is resolved by reducing it to <lb/>the hyper-geometric differential equation satisfied by the Jacobi polynomials. We here instead <lb/>construct the solutions directly in the basis of the free geodesic motion, i.e. in the Y  m <lb/>l  (η, ϕ) <lb/> basis. In so doing, we find superpositions of exponentially damped pseudo-spherical harmonics <lb/>which describe the perturbance by a hyperbolic cotangent function of the free geodesic motion <lb/>on H  2 <lb/>+  . The matrix similarity transformation between the C and (C + 2b coth η) eigenvalue <lb/>problems is then read off from those decompositions which allow to interpret the Hamilto-<lb/>nian of the perturbed motion as a Casimir invariant of an so(2,1) algebra in a representation <lb/></body>

The consequence is a breakdown of the pseudo-<lb/>rotational invariance of the free geodesic motion only at the level of the representation functions <lb/>which becomes apparent through a deformation of the metric of the hyperbolic space, and with-<lb/>out a breakdown of the (2l + 1)-fold degeneracy patterns in the spectrum. Moreover, due to <lb/>cancellation effects occurring by virtue of specific recurrence relations among associated Le-<lb/>gendre functions, the similarity transformation presents itself simple and, as explained in the <lb/>concluding summary section, may specifically benefit applications in problems with an appro-<lb/>ximate so(2,1) symmetry. The problem under investigation is well known to transform into the <lb/>Rosen–Morse potential problem on S  2  by a complexification of the hyperbolic angle, followed by <lb/>a complexification of the strength of the coth η potential. On this basis, the statement on the <lb/>symmetry and degeneracy properties of the Eckart potential on H  2 <lb/>+  can easily be transferred to <lb/>the trigonometric Rosen–Morse potential problem on S  2  . <lb/>The paper is structured as follows. In the next section we present the eigenvalue problem <lb/>of the coth-perturbed particle motion on H  2 <lb/>+  . There, we furthermore work out the respective <lb/>solutions as expansions in the basis of the standard pseudo-spherical harmonics, find the non-<lb/>unitary transformation relating the free and the perturbed geodesic motions, present the class <lb/>of recurrence relations among associated Legendre functions that triggers the above similarity <lb/>transformation. In due places, the conclusions regarding the Rosen–Morse potential problem <lb/>on S  2  have been drawn in parallel to those regarding the Eckart potential. The paper ends with <lb/>concise summary and conclusions. <lb/> 2 Scalar particle motions on H <lb/> 2 <lb/>+  and S <lb/> 2  and representations <lb/>for the so(2,1) and so(3) algebras unitarily nonequivalent <lb/>to the respective pseudo-rotational and rotational ones <lb/> 2.1 From free to perturbed motions <lb/> We begin with taking a closer look on equation (1) for the particular case of l = 0 <lb/> − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> CY <lb/> 0 <lb/>0  (η, ϕ) = 0, <lb/>(4) <lb/>and subject it to a similarity transformation to obtain <lb/> − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> F <lb/> −1  (η)CF(η) <lb/> F <lb/> −1  (η)Y <lb/> 0 <lb/>0  (η, ϕ) <lb/> = − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> C <lb/> F <lb/> −1  (η)Y <lb/> 0 <lb/>0  (η, ϕ) <lb/> = 0, <lb/>(5) <lb/>with <lb/> C = F  −1  (η)CF(η). The general expression for any transformation in (5) is easily worked <lb/>out (cf. [9]) and reads <lb/> C = F <lb/> −1  (η)CF(η) = C + <lb/>1 <lb/> F(η) <lb/> d  2  F(η) <lb/> d  2  η <lb/> + 2 <lb/>1 <lb/> F(η) <lb/> dF(η) <lb/>dη <lb/> d <lb/>dη <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>coth η <lb/> . <lb/> We here chose F(η) differently than in (3) and consider the following scaling similarity trans-<lb/>formation <lb/> F(η) = e <lb/> α (l=0) η <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/>α  (l=0)  = 4b. <lb/>(6) <lb/>Substitution of (6) into (5) amounts to <lb/> − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> C <lb/> Y <lb/> 0 <lb/>0  (η, ϕ) = − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2M <lb/> e <lb/> − <lb/> α (l=0) η <lb/> 2 <lb/> Ce <lb/> α (l=0) η <lb/> 2 <lb/> e <lb/> − <lb/> α (l=0) η <lb/> 2 <lb/> Y <lb/> 0 <lb/>0  (η, ϕ) <lb/></body>

			<body>The latter equation can equally well be used to pin down the expansion coefficients upon using <lb/>the orthogonality properties of the associated Legendre functions. <lb/>The (C + 2b coth η) eigenvalue problem is closely related to the rigid rotator problem on S  2 <lb/> perturbed by a cotangent interaction, (L  2  − 2b cot θ). The two problems have several features in <lb/>common. Also the cot θ interaction preserves the (2l+1)-fold degeneracy patterns characterizing <lb/>the spectrum of the free geodesic motion, despite its non-commutativity with L  2  . The similarities <lb/>between these two cases are due to their interrelation by the following complexifications <lb/> C + 2b coth η <lb/> η→iθ,b→−ib <lb/> −→ <lb/> L <lb/> 2  − 2b cot θ. <lb/> (26) <lb/>It is straightforward to prove that in effect of the complexifications in (26), the equation (22) <lb/>is transformed to <lb/> L <lb/> 2  − 2b cot θ <lb/> X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) = <lb/> e <lb/> − <lb/> α l η <lb/> 2 <lb/> L <lb/> 2  − <lb/> α  2 <lb/> l <lb/> 4 <lb/> e <lb/> α l η <lb/> 2 <lb/> X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) <lb/> = <lb/> L <lb/> 2  − <lb/> α  2 <lb/> l <lb/> 4 <lb/> X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) = <lb/> l(l + 1) − <lb/> α  2 <lb/>(l) <lb/> 4 <lb/> X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ), <lb/> (27) <lb/>with X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) being given as <lb/> X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) = <lb/>  m=l <lb/> m= <lb/> m <lb/> c  l  a <lb/> l <lb/> ( <lb/> m+1)(m+1)  e <lb/> −imϕ <lb/> Y <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) <lb/> e <lb/> i <lb/> mϕ  , <lb/> Y <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) = e <lb/> − <lb/> α l θ <lb/> 2  Y <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ), <lb/> (28) <lb/>where Y  m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) are the standard spherical harmonics, and the constants |c  l  | = 1 account for <lb/>possible sign changes in a  l <lb/> ( <lb/> m+1)(m+1)  in depending on the power of (ib) contained there. In <lb/>conclusion, also the cotangent perturbed rigid rotator can be cast into the form of a Casimir <lb/>invariant of the so(3) algebra though in a representation unitarily nonequivalent to the rotational. <lb/>Also for the latter case the exact solutions of equation (27) are known [16], and expressed in <lb/>terms of real Romanovski polynomials [17] as <lb/> X  <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ, ϕ) = e <lb/> −αθ/2  sin <lb/> l  θR <lb/> 2b <lb/> l+ 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ,−(l+ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  ) <lb/> n <lb/> (cot θ)e <lb/> i <lb/> mϕ  , <lb/> (29) <lb/>and also here in comparing (28) to (29) one finds finite nonlinear decompositions of Romanovski <lb/>polynomials into spherical harmonics according to <lb/>sin <lb/> l  θR <lb/> 2b <lb/> l+ 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ,−(l+ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  ) <lb/> n <lb/> (cot θ) = <lb/> m=l <lb/> m= <lb/> m <lb/> c  l  a <lb/> l <lb/> ( <lb/> m+1)(m+1)  P <lb/> m <lb/>l  (θ). <lb/>The Romanovski polynomials satisfy the following differential hyper-geometric equation <lb/> 1 + x <lb/> 2  d  2  R <lb/> α,β <lb/>n <lb/> dx  2  + 2 <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/>+ βx <lb/> dR <lb/> α,β <lb/>n <lb/> dx <lb/> − n(2β + n − 1)R <lb/> α,β <lb/>n  = 0. <lb/>They are obtained from the following weight function <lb/> ω <lb/> α,β  (x) = <lb/> 1 + x <lb/> 2   β−1  exp <lb/> −α cot <lb/> −1  x <lb/> , <lb/> by means of the Rodrigues formula <lb/> R <lb/> α,β <lb/>n  (x) = <lb/>1 <lb/> ω  α,β  (x) <lb/>d  n <lb/> dx  n <lb/> 1 + x <lb/> 2   n  ω <lb/> α,β  (x) <lb/> . <lb/></body>

			<body> Breaking Pseudo-Rotational Symmetry <lb/>9 <lb/>Although they are related to the Jacobi polynomials as <lb/> R <lb/> α,β <lb/> n  (x) = i <lb/> n  P <lb/> 1−β−i <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,1−β+i <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/> n <lb/> (ix), <lb/>(30) <lb/>within Bochner&apos;s classification scheme they appear as one of the five independent polynomial <lb/>solutions of the hyper-geometric differential equation. Within this context, equation (30) does <lb/>not rule out the necessity of considering the Romanovski polynomials, rather, it presents itself <lb/>as one out of many possible interrelationships among polynomials, valid only under certain <lb/>restrictions of the parameters of at least one of the involved polynomials. <lb/>Another known example of such an interrelationship is provided by the possibility of estab-<lb/>lishing the following link between (unnormalized) associated Legendre functions P  m <lb/>l  and Jacobi <lb/>polynomials <lb/> P <lb/> m <lb/>l  (cos θ) = sin <lb/> m  θP <lb/> m,m <lb/>l−m  (cos θ). <lb/> Obviously, the latter equation does not rule out the associated Legendre functions as a mathe-<lb/>matical entity on its own in favor of Jacobi polynomials with parameters restricted in this very <lb/>particular way. <lb/>Back to the (L  2  − 2b cot θ) eigenvalue problem, it is of interest in the spectroscopy of diatomic <lb/>molecules and has been investigated in the work [16] prior to this, where one can find explicit <lb/>expressions of the expansion coefficients for some of the lowest l values. However, there the <lb/>study has been carried out from a predominantly spectroscopic, and significantly subordinate <lb/>algebraic perspective. Compared to [16], the present work is entirely focused on the algebraic <lb/>aspect of the particle motion on the curved surface of interest, which parallels the formation <lb/>mechanism of the non-unitary similarity transformation connecting C, and (C + 2b coth η). In <lb/>addition, we wish to emphasize, that casting the cotangent perturbed motion on S  2  in (27) as <lb/>a Casimir invariant of an intact geometric so(3) algebra, provides a simple alternative to the <lb/>deformed dynamic so(3) Higgs algebra [18], which approaches same problem from the perspective <lb/>of a rotational generator on the plane tangential to the North pole of the sphere, complemented <lb/>by the two components of a properly designed Runge–Lenz vector there. <lb/> 2.3 Matrix forms of the wave equations <lb/> Equations (23), (24) can be generalized to arbitrary l according to <lb/> X  l  (η, ϕ) = <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> X  0 <lb/> l  (η, ϕ) <lb/> X  1 <lb/> l  (η, ϕ) <lb/>. . . <lb/> X  l <lb/>l  (η, ϕ) <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> = e <lb/> − <lb/> α l η <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> F  0 <lb/> l  (η)e  i0ϕ <lb/> F  1 <lb/> l  (η)e  iϕ <lb/> · · · <lb/> F  l <lb/>l  (η)e  ilϕ <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> = A  l  (ϕ)e <lb/> − <lb/> α l η <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> Y  0 <lb/> l  (η, ϕ) <lb/> Y  1 <lb/> l  (η, ϕ) <lb/>. . . <lb/> Y  l <lb/>l  (η, ϕ) <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/>A  l  (ϕ) = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> a  l <lb/> 11  a  l <lb/> 12  e  −iϕ  . . . <lb/>a  l <lb/> 1(l+1)  e  −ilϕ <lb/> 0 <lb/> a  l <lb/> 22 <lb/> ... a  l <lb/> 2(l+1)  e  −i(l−1)ϕ <lb/> . . . <lb/>. . . <lb/>. . . <lb/>. . . <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/> a  l <lb/> (l+1)(l+1) <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> . <lb/> (31) <lb/>Then the matrix form of equation (22), after accounting for (11), extends correspondingly to <lb/> e <lb/> − <lb/> α l η <lb/> 2  A  l  (ϕ)Ce <lb/> α l η <lb/> 2  A <lb/> −1 <lb/> l  (ϕ) + <lb/> α  2 <lb/> l <lb/> 4 <lb/> X  l  (η, ϕ), = −  l  X  l  (η, ϕ), <lb/> l  = −l(l + 1) − <lb/> α  2 <lb/> l <lb/> 4 <lb/>= −l(l + 1) − <lb/> b  2 <lb/> l + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>  2  . <lb/> (32) <lb/></body>

			<body> In this way, the eigenvalue problem in equation (10) takes its final form <lb/>(C + 2b coth η)X  l  (η, ϕ) = <lb/> C + <lb/> α  2 <lb/> l <lb/> 4 <lb/> X  l  (η, ϕ), <lb/> C = e <lb/> − <lb/> α t η <lb/> 2  A  l  (ϕ)Ce <lb/> α t η <lb/> 2  A <lb/> −1 <lb/> l  (ϕ), <lb/>(33) <lb/>with C being extended to a matrix encoding the dimensionality of the so(2,1) representation <lb/>space under consideration. The explicit matrices A  l  (ϕ) for l = 1 and l = 2 were given in <lb/>equations (23), (24). As a reminder, equation (33) can be obtained from equation (13) in combi-<lb/>nation with the recurrence relations in equations (18)–(21). Equation (33) defines a particular <lb/>representation of the so(2,1) algebra whose eigenvalue problem is related to the standard pseudo-<lb/>rotational one by a dilation transformation. The <lb/> C operator realization is unitarily nonequivalent <lb/>to C and the motion of a particle on H  2 <lb/>+  , perturbed by the coth η potential, breaks the pseudo-<lb/>rotational invariance at the level of the representation functions. However, the degeneracy is <lb/>defined by the eigenvalues of the Casimir invariant of the algebra and does not depend on the <lb/>particular realization of the algebra, a reason for which the perturbed spectrum in (32) carries <lb/>same degeneracy patterns as the unperturbed one, corresponding to b = 0. <lb/>Finally, obtaining the counterpart to equation (33) for the case of the cotangent perturbed <lb/>rigid rotator on S  2  along the line of equations (26)–(28) is too simple an exercise as to be <lb/>explicitly worked out here, and we omit it in favor of a keeping the presentation more concise. <lb/> 3 Summary and conclusions <lb/> In the present study, attention was drawn to relevance for physics problems of non-unitary <lb/>similarity transformations of some isometry algebras of curved surfaces. Specifically, the so(1,2) <lb/>isometry algebra of the two-dimensional two-sheeted hyperboloid was considered in detail and <lb/>a non-unitary similarity transformation was found that connected the eigenvalue problems of the <lb/>Casimir operator of the free geodesic motion and the one perturbed by a hyperbolic cotangent <lb/>interaction. <lb/>The similarity transformation was concluded from transparent finite decompositions of the <lb/>exact solutions of the Eckart potential in the bases of exponentially scaled pseudo-spherical <lb/>harmonics presented in the above equations (24), and (31). It furthermore was motivated by <lb/>the relevance of specific recurrence relations (19)–(21) among associated Legendre functions. <lb/>A merit of representing the exact solutions of the Eckart potential as superpositions of damped <lb/>pseudo-spherical harmonics is that these expansions would provide a practical tool in the de-<lb/>scription of quantum mechanical systems on H  2 <lb/>+  whose interactions are only approximately <lb/>described by the Eckart potential, in which case the elements of the matrices A  l  (ϕ) could be <lb/>considered as parameters to be adjusted to data. <lb/>The perturbed geodesic motion on H  2 <lb/>+  in terms of the Eckart potential as considered here, had <lb/>the peculiarity that the perturbance respected the degeneracy of the unperturbed free geodesic <lb/>motion though it broke the isometry group symmetry at the level of the representation functions. <lb/>The case under consideration easily extended to the cotangent perturbed rigid rotator on S  2  and <lb/>verified similar observations earlier reported in [16]. In this fashion, two examples of a symmetry <lb/>breaking at the level of the representation functions have been constructed, breakdowns that <lb/>appeared camouflaged by the conservation of the degeneracy patterns in the spectra. <lb/>This subtle type of symmetry breaking was visualized in Figs. 1 and 2 through the deformation <lb/>of the metric of the respective H  2 <lb/>+  hyperboloid, and the S  2  sphere, by the exponential scalings <lb/> e  −αη/2  |Y  0 <lb/>0  (η, ϕ), and e  −αθ/2  |Y  0 <lb/>0  (θ, ϕ). <lb/></body>
