Ramsey-Musolf <lb/> a b s t r a c t <lb/> The aim of this report is to give basic notions on electromagnetic hadron form factors <lb/>(FFs), as they are understood at the present time, to summarize and analyze the present <lb/>experimental results and available theoretical models and to open a view on future <lb/>perspectives. <lb/>FFs are fundamental quantities, which describe the internal, dynamical structure of <lb/>hadrons. Although the theoretical formalism was settled in the middle of last century, as <lb/>well as the first experiments in electron–proton elastic scattering for which R. Hofstadter <lb/>got the Nobel prize in 1961, a renewed activity is due to recent, surprising results and <lb/>to the opening of new experimental possibilities. An elegant formalism was built on the <lb/>assumption of a hadron electromagnetic interaction based on the exchange of a virtual <lb/>photon of four-momentum q <lb/> 2 . In this case FFs are analytic functions of only one variable, <lb/> q <lb/> 2 , and the electromagnetic vertex  γ <lb/>  *  hh (h is any hadron) is defined by two structure <lb/>functions, which, in turn, are expressed in terms of  (2S +  1) FFs, S being the hadron spin, <lb/>assuming parity and time-invariance. <lb/>Our aim is to anticipate the potentiality contained in the future data, combined with <lb/>the present knowledge, to point out the relevant observables and the most significative <lb/>measurements, and to give predictions to be compared to the data when they will be <lb/>available. <lb/> ©  2014 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction <lb/> The first experimental evidence for a composite structure of the proton, arising from charge and magnetization currents, <lb/>dynamically changing with the distance (probed by the virtual photon in ep elastic scattering), was given in a series of <lb/>experiments at the Stanford accelerator SLAC [1]. <lb/>The fundamental role played by form factors (FFs) was recognized since these first measurements when R. Hofstadter <lb/>(and collaborators) [2] was rewarded by the Nobel prize in 1961. G. Liljestrand, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, <lb/>addressed to him with these words: &apos;&apos;The myth of the indivisibility of the atom, implied in its very name, was shattered in the <lb/>beginning of this century, and a completely new and fascinating world of the utmost importance became revealed. You have <lb/>been able to obtain further significant information of the intimate structure of this intriguing world by disclosing the distribution <lb/>of electric charges and magnetic forces within the atomic nucleus, and the particles of which it is composed&apos;&apos;. R. Hofstadter in <lb/>his Nobel lecture replies: &apos;&apos;Over a period of time lasting at least two thousand years, Man has puzzled over and sought an <lb/>understanding of the composition of matter. It is no wonder that his interest has been aroused in this deep question because <lb/>all objects he experiences, including, even his own body, are in a most basic sense special configurations of matter. The history <lb/>of physics shows that whenever experimental techniques advance to an extent that matter, as then known, can be analyzed by <lb/>reliable and proved methods into its &apos;&apos;elemental&apos;&apos; parts, newer and more powerful studies subsequently show that the &apos;&apos;elementary <lb/>particles&apos;&apos; have a structure themselves. Indeed this structure may be quite complex, so that the elegant idea of elementarity must <lb/>be abandoned.&apos;&apos; <lb/> Since, the experimental determination of the elastic proton electromagnetic FFs at large momentum transfer has been <lb/>one of the major field of research in hadron physics, following the experimental progress which allowed to reach better <lb/>precision and/or kinematically unexplored regions. It is presently of large interest, especially due to the possibility to perform <lb/>polarization experiments. <lb/>The possibility of extended measurements has inspired experimental programs to measure hadron FFs at practically <lb/>all experimental facilities dedicated to hadron physics, both in scattering and in annihilation processes. Electron beams <lb/>in the GeV range are presently available at MAMI and JLab, with high intensity and high polarization, large acceptance <lb/>spectrometers, hadron polarized targets, and hadron polarimeters. In colliding mode, the VEPP-2000 facility at Novosibirsk <lb/>and, at higher energy, the BESIII facility at BEPCII provide 4π detection with high luminosity e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  collisions. High intensity <lb/>antiproton beams will be available at PANDA (FAIR) in near future. <lb/>Hadron FFs are considered fundamental quantities, as they characterize the internal structure of a non pointlike <lb/>particle. They contain dynamical information on the electric and magnetic currents of hadrons. Experimentally, they are <lb/>accessible through the measurements of differential cross section and polarization observables. Theoretically, FFs enter in <lb/>the expression of the electromagnetic current. Any hadron theory, that reproduces the static properties such as masses <lb/>and magnetic moments, should be able to describe also the dynamics of the charge and magnetic distributions, i.e., the <lb/>electromagnetic FFs. <lb/>In a P and T invariant theory, the structure of any particle of spin S is parametrized in terms of (2S  +  1) FFs. Protons and <lb/>neutrons are described by two FFs, electric G E  and magnetic G M  , which are functions of one kinematical variable, physically <lb/>representing the internal scale. The deuteron (spin one particle) is described by three FFs, charge, electric, and quadrupole. <lb/>The  α  particle, spin zero, has one FF. <lb/>The normalization of these FFs is related to the charge and the magnetic moment of the hadron and corresponds to <lb/>the static value which can be observed through low energy electron elastic scattering on hadrons, at the photon point. <lb/>Schematically, one can say that at small momenta (large internal distances) FFs probe the size of the nucleus. At high <lb/>energies (short distances) they probe the quark and gluon structure. Their behavior should follow scaling laws, predicted by <lb/>perturbative quantum-chromodynamics (pQCD). In this respect, the precise knowledge of FFs in a wide kinematical region <lb/>should probe the transition region, from non perturbative to pQCD. <lb/>The traditional way to measure proton electromagnetic FFs consists in the measurement of electron–proton elastic <lb/>scattering, assuming that the interaction occurs through the exchange of a virtual photon, of four momentum squared <lb/> Q <lb/> 2  = −q <lb/> 2 . The differential cross section at a fixed value of Q <lb/> 2 depends linearly on cot <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ /2)  (where  θ  is the electron <lb/>scattering angle). The slope and the intercept allow to determine G E  and G M  . This is a specific characteristic of the one <lb/>photon exchange mechanism. This method was proposed first by N.M. Rosenbluth [3]. <lb/></body>

			<body> Polarization phenomena play a major role (except for spin zero particles), as they contain unique information on the <lb/>imaginary part of amplitudes (amplitudes are, in general, complex functions). Being related to interference of amplitudes, <lb/>they are very sensitive to small contributions. Elastic electron–hadron scattering has been the privileged reaction to access <lb/>FFs. Assuming one photon exchange, a simple and elegant formalism, which will be illustrated in this paper, relates all <lb/>observables, cross section and polarization phenomena, to hadron FFs. <lb/>The idea that double spin polarization observables in elastic electron–proton (ep) scattering (with longitudinally <lb/>polarized electrons on a polarized target, or on an unpolarized target with measurement of the transverse polarization of <lb/>the scattered proton) carry the information on the product G E G M  was firstly suggested by A.I. Akhiezer and M.P. Rekalo [4,5], <lb/>but was only recently applied. Besides the expected large precision achieved, the surprising fact was that the data revealed a <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 -dependence of the ratio  R  = µG  E  /G  M  (µ is the proton magnetic moment) which deviates from unity, as was previously <lb/>commonly assumed. <lb/>In case of the neutron, the measurements are even more difficult, as the electric FF is small (the static value is zero). As <lb/>there is no free neutron target, one has to use either a deuteron or a <lb/> 3 He target, and then correct for nuclear effects. In the <lb/>neutron case, too, the polarization method allows to extend the measurements in the scattering region at larger Q <lb/> 2 values <lb/>with higher precision. <lb/>For other baryons, as  Λ,  it is possible to measure the polarization through the angular distribution of their (weak) decay <lb/>products. This is especially relevant to  Λ  ¯ <lb/> Λ  production at electron–positron colliders. <lb/>Applying crossing symmetry considerations, the same physical information can be extracted from the annihilation <lb/>reactions:  ¯ <lb/> p  +  p  ↔  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> −  through the measurement of a precise angular distribution. However, the kinematical variables <lb/>scan a different region, called the time-like (TL) region, because the momentum transfer squared is positive here (i.e., the <lb/>time component of the four momentum transfer squared, q <lb/> 2 , is larger than the space component). The region accessible <lb/>through the scattering channel is denoted as space-like (SL) region. <lb/>FFs are assumed to be analytic functions of q <lb/> 2 [6]. In the general case, reaction amplitudes are complex functions of the <lb/>relevant kinematical variables. Analyticity and unitarity constrain FFs to be real in SL region, and complex in TL region. Up <lb/>to now, no individual determination of FFs has been done in TL region, due to the low available luminosity. FFs have been <lb/>determined under the assumption G E  =  G M  or G E  =  0 [7]. Attempts of measuring the FF ratio were done by PS170 [8] and <lb/>BaBar collaborations [9]. <lb/>Inconsistencies appeared among the results from polarized and unpolarized experiments in SL region. The ratio  µG  E  /G  M <lb/> measured from the ratio P  ℓ /P  t  (the longitudinal and transverse polarization of the recoil proton in ep scattering induced by <lb/>longitudinally polarized electrons) shows a monotone decreasing with Q <lb/> 2 , whereas the individual determination of G E  and <lb/> G M  from unpolarized ep scattering suggests a constant behavior. No shortcoming has been found either in the experiments <lb/>nor in the data analysis, both being based on the same theoretical background (the lowest order diagrams for ep elastic <lb/>scattering). Therefore, the attention has been focused to higher order radiative corrections in the power of  α,  (∼α <lb/> n  ) including <lb/>the interference between one and two photon exchange. This puzzle has given rise to many speculations and different <lb/>interpretations, suggesting further experiments (for a review, see Ref. [10]). <lb/>From a theoretical point of view, the new results obtained with the polarization method have stimulated a revision of <lb/>the nucleon models. The interpretation of FFs as the Fourier transforms of charge and magnetization densities is exact only <lb/>in non relativistic approximation or in the Breit frame, where the four components of the momentum can be reduced to <lb/>three. Recent model dependent pictures of the proton structure have been derived. In particular, FFs are specific integrals <lb/>of generalized parton distributions, and they constitute, in this respect, an experimental constraint for these functions. <lb/>Different classes of models have been developed in the non perturbative region: soliton models, constituent quarks, di-<lb/>quark models, vector meson dominance (VMD), dispersion relations (DR) etc. However, not all of these models are able to <lb/>describe the existing data on the four nucleon FFs (electric, magnetic, neutron and proton) and not all of them contain the <lb/>necessary analytic properties to describe both the SL and TL regions [11]. <lb/>Reviews are present in the literature, reflecting, however, a sociological aspect of the discipline: the fact that communities <lb/>are clustered around accelerator-based laboratories, therefore focused on a specific probe: electron scattering at JLab, <lb/>electron–positron collisions at SLAC (BaBar), IHEP (BESIII) and Novosibirsk (VEPP-2000), proton–antiproton annihilation <lb/>at FermiLab and FAIR (PANDA). <lb/>For instance, Ref. [10] covers in detail aspects concerning both experiments and theory of nucleon FFs in SL region only. On <lb/>the other hand, Ref. [12], is an exhaustive review mostly devoted to FFs in the TL region. In both cases the authors mention the <lb/>main theoretical concepts on which the FF analyticity is grounded and eventually the possibility of interpreting SL and TL FF <lb/>data as the same physical object but in different kinematical domains. However, the need of a unified description that fulfills <lb/>the regularity requirements coming from first principles is not stressed. Even though phenomenological parametrizations <lb/>of FFs, based on DRs, from Refs. [13–16] (see also Section 5.2.1), have been quoted as an example of unified description, no <lb/>special attention has been payed to the concrete advantages in imposing such analyticity constraints, as, in particular, those <lb/>concerning the asymptotic behavior and the connection between SL zeros of FFs with their TL phase. <lb/>Specializing a review on a particular domain and thus focusing on either SL or TL FFs, does not allow to fully exploit the <lb/>rich information contained in the relevant data and theory. <lb/>This work recalls the essential mathematical background and gives the basic derivations of the necessary formulas. We <lb/>focus here on a global understanding of FFs in the full kinematical domain: TL and SL regions. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1. Schematic view of elastic scattering on a composite object with charge distribution  {e  j  }. <lb/> Model independent and dependent aspects of the underlying theory will be presented, emphasizing those models which <lb/>may offer, by construction, a description in both TL and SL regions. A review of the existing data and of the planned <lb/>experiments will follow. Finally, the expectations from future experiments will be critically summarized at the light of the <lb/>recent theoretical findings. <lb/>The report is structured as follows: <lb/> •  Section 2 recalls historical notions and retraces the concepts which lead to the definition of FFs, starting from a <lb/>(semi)classical approach. The formal definition, in frame on the one-photon exchange mechanism both in annihilation <lb/>and scattering regions, is presented in a fully relativistic framework. The expressions relating the experimental <lb/>unpolarized and polarized observables to FFs are explicitly given. <lb/> •  In Section 3 mathematical properties of FFs, related to analyticity are developed and their consequences on the <lb/>asymptotic behavior are illustrated. Quark counting rules are recalled. DRs which connect real to imaginary part are <lb/>derived. <lb/> •  The experimental data are presented in Section 4. The experimental methods for extracting FFs in unpolarized and <lb/>polarized electron–proton scattering, as well as in the annihilation region, are recalled with particular attention to the <lb/>unique information contained in polarization observables. <lb/> •  Selected theoretical models on the nucleon structure are described in Section 5, with specific attention to those models <lb/>which contain by construction the necessary properties to be applied to both the SL and TL regions. The comparison with <lb/>the experimental data in all the kinematical region is discussed. <lb/> •  FFs describe the vertex  γ <lb/>  *  NN and have their meaning in frame of the one photon exchange approximation. Section 6 <lb/>presents the radiative corrections beyond the Born approximation, due to hard, soft, real, and virtual additional photon <lb/>emission. Model independent and model dependent properties of two photon exchange are described, together with the <lb/>search for experimental evidence of a sizable effect. <lb/> •  Future experimental programs at the main dedicated experimental facilities are presented in Section 7. Conclusions <lb/>summarize the main issues and open questions in this field. <lb/>Detailed derivations of specific parts, along the text, are presented in appendices: kinematical relations and expressions <lb/>for the hadronic and leptonic tensors are derived in Appendix A. Appendix B details the expressions for the relativistic <lb/>description of the electron and proton polarizations necessary for the calculation of the observables in SL region. Appendix C <lb/>gives the unpolarized and polarized cross sections in the TL region in terms of (complex) FFs. Appendix D gives details related <lb/>to hermiticity, and to mathematical properties of FFs and recalls useful theorems. It contains a formal derivation of DRs, in <lb/>the case of logarithm with singularities. Model independent properties of the unpolarized cross section and of polarization <lb/>observables induced by two photon exchange are presented in Appendix E. Finally, Appendix F contains a list of notations <lb/>and abbreviations frequently used along the text. <lb/> 2. Basic notions <lb/> 2.1. Semi-classical definition <lb/> Let us recall briefly a semi-classical treatment of two-body elastic scattering in order to introduce the concept of FF. <lb/>In quantum mechanics, the particle–wave duality requires that a particle of three momentum p is associated to a plane <lb/>wave vector k  =  p/¯ h. If a plane wave scatters off a charge e j  at a position  ρ  j  , it generates a spherical wave, that can be <lb/>observed at large distances as a plane wave k <lb/> ′ =  p <lb/> ′ <lb/> /¯  h. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of this process. The amplitude of <lb/>the scattered wave in the point defined by r is: <lb/> A j  =  fe i e <lb/> ik·ρ i e <lb/> ik  ′ ·(r−ρ  i  )  =  fe <lb/> ik  ′ ·r  e j e <lb/> iq·ρ i  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where f is the amplitude on the unit charge, f  =  Z a e, which is the same for all constituent particles, r  − ρ  i  is the vector from <lb/>the observation point to the ith charge, and q  =  k  −  k <lb/> ′  is the momentum transfer. The factor e <lb/> ik·ρ j  defines the phase of the <lb/></body>

			<body> incident plane wave at the interaction point, and e <lb/> ik  ′  ·(r−ρ  j  )  determines the phase of the scattered wave at the observation <lb/>point. Similarly to optics, the total scattered amplitude on a charge distribution  {e  j  }  can be taken as the sum of the amplitudes <lb/>on the individual charges: <lb/> A  = <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> A j  =  fe <lb/> ik  ′ ·r <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> e j e <lb/> iq·ρ j  /¯  h <lb/> . <lb/> (2) <lb/>However, in quantum mechanics,  ρ  j  represent the position operators of the internal motion in the target. Therefore the last <lb/>term should be replaced by the corresponding mean value in the ground state of the target. We define the FF as: <lb/> F  (q) = <lb/> 1 <lb/> Z b e <lb/> ⟨i| <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> e j e <lb/> iq·ρ j  /¯  h  |i⟩, <lb/> (3) <lb/>and then the cross section on an extended nucleus becomes <lb/>  <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/>  <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  <lb/> pl <lb/> |F (q)| <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where <lb/>  <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  <lb/> pl <lb/> = (Z  b e) <lb/> 2  |f | <lb/> 2  ∝ (Z  a Z b e <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (5) <lb/>is identified to the cross section on a point-like particle. <lb/> 2.2. The charge form factor <lb/> FFs are fundamental quantities, as they allow a direct comparison between the theory and the experiment. In order to <lb/>determine  |F (q)| <lb/> 2 one has to measure the differential cross section, for different values of q. This can be done by varying the <lb/>scattering angle and the energy of the projectile. The mean value of the charge density can be deduced by inverting Eq. (3) <lb/>and, using natural units  ¯ <lb/> h  =  c  =  1, <lb/> 1 it reads <lb/> ρ(x) = ⟨Ψ  i  | ˆ <lb/> ρ(x)|Ψ  i  ⟩ = <lb/> Z b e <lb/> (2π )  3 <lb/>  <lb/> d <lb/> 3  q F  (q)e <lb/> −iq·x <lb/> . <lb/> (6) <lb/>However, in practice, F  (q)  cannot be determined for all values of q, due to the limits of the kinematically accessible region. <lb/>Moreover, at large q, cross sections are very small and difficult to measure. Furthermore, the cross section is sensitive to <lb/>the FF modulus squared, and does not give access to the phase. Therefore, in general, one assumes a specific mathematical <lb/>function for  ρ(x),  and free parameters that are fitted to the experimental data. <lb/>For small values of q <lb/> 2 one can develop F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  in a Taylor series expansion on q  ·  x: <lb/> F  (q) = <lb/> 1 <lb/> Z b e <lb/>  <lb/> d <lb/> 3  xe <lb/> iq·x <lb/> ρ(x) <lb/> = <lb/> 1 <lb/> Z b e <lb/>  <lb/> d <lb/> 3  x <lb/>  <lb/> 1  +  iq  ·  x  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> (q ·  x) <lb/> 2  + . . . <lb/>  <lb/> ρ(x) <lb/> ≃ <lb/> 1 <lb/> Z b e <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> x <lb/> 2  dx <lb/>   2π <lb/>0 <lb/> dφ <lb/>   1 <lb/> −1 <lb/> d cos  ϑ <lb/>  <lb/> 1  +  iqx cos  ϑ − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> q <lb/> 2  x <lb/> 2 cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> ϑ <lb/>  <lb/> ρ(x). <lb/> The normalization, over a volume  Ω  containing the whole charge distribution, is <lb/>  <lb/> Ω <lb/> d <lb/> 3  xρ(x)  =  Z b e. The second term does <lb/>not give any contribution, as q  ·x =  qx cos  ϑ  and <lb/>   1 <lb/> −1  cos  ϑ  d cos  ϑ =  0.

Relativistic kinematics <lb/> We describe the proton electromagnetic interaction, with a similar formalism for the reactions of interest: ep elastic <lb/>scattering and the crossed reactions: e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − ↔ ¯ <lb/> p  +  p, following Ref. [18]. It is assumed that the interaction occurs through <lb/>one-photon exchange, in t and s channels, respectively. Let us consider elastic electron–proton scattering: <lb/> ¯ <lb/> e <lb/> − <lb/> (k  1  ) +  p(p  1  ) →  e <lb/> − <lb/> (k  2  ) +  p(p  2  ). <lb/> (16) <lb/>Crossing symmetry applies at the tree level (Born approximation) and, for the considered reactions, it implies that the two <lb/>channels are described by the same amplitude, when the Mandelstam variables s and t scan different accessible kinematical <lb/>regions. The transformation t  →  s-channel can be realized by the following substitution: k  1  → −k  1  ,  p  2  → −p  2 , and, <lb/>of course, for the invariant variables: t  →  s. Therefore, expressing the phase space and the matrix element in form of <lb/>invariants, gives a powerful method to describe simultaneously the three channels. <lb/>The Feynman diagram for elastic eN-scattering, N is any hadron, is shown in Fig. 2, assuming one-photon exchange. <lb/>The squared value of the four-momentum transferred by the virtual photon, q  =  k  1  −  k  2  =  p  2  −  p  1 , represents a basic <lb/>kinematical variable for elastic eN scattering. It can be expressed in terms of the energies and the scattering angle  θ  e  in the <lb/>laboratory frame as <lb/> q <lb/> 2  = (k  1  −  k  2  ) <lb/> 2  =  2m <lb/> 2  −  2ϵ 1  ϵ  2  (1 − β  1  β  2 cos  θ  e  ) −−→ <lb/> m→0 <lb/> −4ϵ  1  ϵ  2 sin <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/>β  i  = <lb/>  <lb/> 1  −  m  2  /ϵ <lb/> 2 <lb/> i  , <lb/> q <lb/> 2  = (p  2  −  p  1  ) <lb/> 2  = −2M(E  2  −  M)  = −2M(ϵ  1  − ϵ  2  ), <lb/> (17) <lb/>where m is the mass,  ϵ  i  (β  i  ), i  =  1, 2, is the energy (velocity) of the initial and scattered electron, while E  2 and M are the <lb/>energy and mass of the recoil nucleon. From Eq. (17) follows that, in case of elastic scattering, the momentum transfer <lb/>squared, q <lb/> 2 , is negative for all energies and scattering angles of the outgoing electron. As q <lb/> 2 is a relativistic invariant, this is <lb/>true in any reference system. <lb/>2The most used reference systems are the following (see Table 2). <lb/> •  In the scattering region the laboratory system (Lab), where the target is at rest, and the Breit system defined as the <lb/>reference frame where the initial and final nucleon energies are the same, see Appendix A. <lb/> •  In the annihilation region the center of mass system (CMS), where the sum of initial (as well as final) particle three-<lb/>momenta is zero. <lb/> •  The Sudakov (or light cone) frame introduced for peripheral collisions, which allows to consider separately the <lb/>longitudinal direction and the transverse plane. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 3. Illustration of the Rosenbluth separation for the differential cross section of eN-elastic scattering. <lb/> which is valid for elastic electron scattering by any hadron, in any reference system (dΩ  e  should be defined consistently), <lb/>assuming one-photon exchange. The q <lb/> 2 -dependent quantities A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are scalar structure functions, which are <lb/>expressed through electromagnetic FFs. A measurement at fixed q <lb/> 2 and forward or backward angles allows to single out <lb/>one or the other function. <lb/>Let us introduce two invariant expressions: <lb/> I  0  = (k  1  ·  p  1  )(k  2  ·  p  1  ) + <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> q <lb/> 2  M <lb/> 2  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>16 <lb/> [(s −  u) <lb/> 2  −  t(t  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> )], <lb/> I  1  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> (t +  2m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> (31) <lb/>where: s  = (k  1  +p  1  ) <lb/> 2 , u  = (k  2  −p  1  ) <lb/> 2 , t  =  q <lb/> 2  = −Q <lb/> 2  = (k  1  −k  2  ) <lb/> 2 are the Mandelstam variables, with s+t  +u =  2(M <lb/> 2  +m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ). <lb/> In the approximation of zero electron mass they reduce to: <lb/> I  0  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> t M <lb/> 2 cot <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ  e  /2), <lb/> I  1  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> t M <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> and Eq. (30) becomes <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ e <lb/> = <lb/> dσ M <lb/> dΩ e <lb/>  <lb/> A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) +  B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> I  1 <lb/> I  0 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (32) <lb/>with <lb/> A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  + τ <lb/>  <lb/> G <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + τ  G <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>  , <lb/> B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  2τ G <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ). <lb/> (33) <lb/>The positivity of G <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  , which is a consequence of its reality in the SL region, implies the inequality <lb/> B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> A(q  2  ) <lb/> ≤  1  + τ . <lb/> Note that the very specific cot <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ  e  /2)-dependence  of the cross section for eN-scattering results from the assumption of one-<lb/>photon mechanism. This can be easily proved [20], by exploiting crossing symmetry, considering the annihilation channel, <lb/> e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p. In CMS of such reaction, the one-photon mechanism induces a simple and evident cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ )-dependence <lb/> (where  θ  is the proton scattering angle) of the corresponding differential cross section, due to the C -invariance of the hadron <lb/>electromagnetic interaction and unity of the photon spin. <lb/> 2.5.2. Polarization observables <lb/> In general the hadronic tensor W  µν  , for ep elastic scattering, contains four terms, corresponding to the four possibilities <lb/>of polarizing the initial and final protons: <lb/> W  µν  =  W <lb/> (0) <lb/>µν  +  W  µν (P  1  ) +  W  µν (P  2  ) +  W  µν (P  1  ,  P  2  ), <lb/> where P  1 , (P 2 ) is the polarization vector of the initial (final) proton. The first term corresponds to the unpolarized case, <lb/>the second (third) term corresponds to the case when the initial (final) proton is polarized, and the last term describes the <lb/>reaction when both protons (initial and final) are polarized. The 2  ×  2 density matrix for a nucleon with polarization P can <lb/>be written as:  ρ = (1 + σ ·  P)/2, where  σ  is the three-vector of the Pauli matrices. <lb/></body>

			<body> In the case where only the final proton is polarized (P  =  P  2 ): <lb/> W  µν  (P) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>Tr[F  µ  F <lb/> Ď <lb/> ν  σ ·  P], <lb/> (34) <lb/> F  µ  is given in Eq. (A.11). For the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons (by unpolarized target), only the x and z <lb/> components of the polarization vector P do not vanish. To find these components, the tensors W  µν (P  x  )  and W  µν (P  z  )  have <lb/>to be computed. From the definition of F  µ  , Eq. (A.11), and the simple algebra of the Pauli matrices we can see that the only <lb/>non-zero components of the hadronic tensor W  µν (P  x  )  are: <lb/> W  0y  (P  x  ) =  i <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 2MG  E G M  , <lb/> W y0  (P  x  ) = −i <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 2MG  E G M  . <lb/> It follows that W  µν (P  x  )  is an antisymmetrical tensor and hence the contraction L  µν  W <lb/> µν <lb/> (P  x  )  vanishes. This means that the <lb/>polarization of the final proton vanishes, if the electron is unpolarized: unpolarized electrons cannot induce polarization <lb/>of the scattered proton. <lb/> This is a property of the one-photon mechanism for any elastic electron–hadron scattering and of the hermiticity of the <lb/>Hamiltonian for the hadron electromagnetic interaction. Namely the hermiticity condition allows to prove that the hadron <lb/>electromagnetic FFs are real functions of the momentum transfer squared in the SL region. On the other hand, in the TL <lb/>region, which is scanned by the annihilation processes, e <lb/> − +  e <lb/> + ↔ ¯ <lb/> p  +  p, the nucleon electromagnetic FFs are complex <lb/>functions of q <lb/> 2 , if q <lb/> 2  ≥  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  , where m  π  is the pion mass (see Section 3.1). <lb/>The complexity of nucleon FFs (in the TL region) results in specific polarization phenomena, for the annihilation processes <lb/> e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − ↔ ¯ <lb/> p  +  p, which are different from the case of elastic ep-scattering. For example, the polarization of the final proton <lb/>(or antiproton) is different from zero, even in the case of collisions of unpolarized leptons: this polarization is determined <lb/>by the imaginary part: Im[G  E G <lb/>  * <lb/> M  ]  (and, therefore, it vanishes in the case of elastic ep-scattering, where FFs are real). <lb/>Let us consider now the proton polarization in the z-direction: <lb/>W  µν (P  z  ) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>Tr[F  µ  F <lb/> Ď <lb/> ν σ  z  ]. <lb/> One finds that W  0ν  (P  z  ) =  W  ν0 (P  z  ) =  0, for any  ν,  and no interference term G E G M  is present. The non-zero components of <lb/> W  µν (P  z  )  are: <lb/> W xy  (P  z  ) = −iq <lb/> 2  G <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  , <lb/> W yx  (P  z  ) =  iq <lb/> 2  G <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  , <lb/> (35) <lb/>therefore, W  µν (P  z  )  is an antisymmetrical tensor, which depends on G <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  and the ratio P x  /P  z  ∝  G E  /G  M  . <lb/> Polarized electron <lb/> The leptonic tensor, L  µν  , in case of unpolarized particles, contains only one term. For longitudinally polarized electrons, <lb/>the polarization is characterized by the helicity  λ,  which takes values  ±1,  corresponding to the direction of spin, parallel or <lb/>anti-parallel, to the electron three-momentum. <lb/>The general expression for the leptonic tensor in case of longitudinally polarized electrons is: <lb/> L  µν  =  L <lb/> (0) <lb/>µν  +  L  µν (λ  1  ) +  L  µν (λ  2  ) +  L  µν (λ  1  , λ  2  ), <lb/> (36) <lb/>where the first term, previously considered, describes the collision where the initial and final electrons are unpolarized, the <lb/>second (third) term describes the case when the initial (final) electron is longitudinally polarized, and the last term holds <lb/>when both electrons are longitudinally polarized. <lb/>If only the initial electron is polarized,  λ  1  = λ,  one can write (see Appendix B.1) <lb/> L  µν (λ) =  2iλϵ  µναβ  k  1α  k  2β  . <lb/> (37) <lb/>The effect of the electron polarization is described by an antisymmetrical tensor L  µν (λ).  If the initial proton is unpolarized, <lb/>again, being described by symmetrical tensor, the total result will be zero. This conclusion can be drawn because FFs are <lb/>real, so it does not apply to TL region. <lb/> Recoil proton polarization <lb/> The proton recoil polarization technique consists in measuring the polarization, transferred to the recoiling protons, by <lb/>polarized incident electrons in a elastic scattering process  ⃗  e <lb/> − +p →  e <lb/> − +⃗  p (the over arrow indicates polarized particle). The <lb/>proton polarization vector, P, lies in the scattering plane, identified with the xz plane, hence P y  =  0. The x and z components, <lb/>also called transverse P t  =  P x  and longitudinal P l  =  P z  , depend on the FFs in such a way that their ratio is proportional to <lb/>the ratio G E  /G  M  as <lb/> P t <lb/> P  ℓ <lb/> = −2  cot(θ  e  /2) <lb/> M p <lb/> ϵ  1  + ϵ  2 <lb/> G E <lb/> G M <lb/> . <lb/> (38) <lb/>For a detailed derivation see Appendix B.2. The relation of Eq. (38) clearly shows that a measurement of the ratio of transverse <lb/>to longitudinal polarization of the recoil proton gives a direct measurement of the ratio of electric and magnetic FFs, G E  /G  M  . <lb/></body>

This results from the one-photon mechanism and the fact that G E  and G M  are real. For the same reasons, the <lb/>corresponding analyzing power, A y  , also vanishes. <lb/> 2.6. Helicity amplitudes for binary reactions with spins 1/2  +  1/2  →  1/2  +  1/2 <lb/>Let us consider ep elastic scattering, although the statements in this section have a general validity for binary reactions <lb/>involving spin 1/2 particles. Assuming that the scattering matrix  M  is invariant under Lorentz transformation, the total <lb/>number of amplitudes which characterize a binary reaction is  (2S  1  +  1)(2S 2  +  1)(2S 3  +  1)(2S 4  +  1), where S i  , i  =  1,  . . . ,  4, <lb/>is the spin of the ith particle involved. For spin 1/2 particles, which can be in two helicity states, denoted &apos;&apos;±&apos;&apos;, the 16 <lb/>possibilities are listed in Table 3. These amplitudes are, in general, complex functions of two kinematical variables, for <lb/>example s and t. However, not all of them are independent, in fact they are related by symmetry properties. <lb/> •  Parity conservation implies the identity of the amplitudes obtained by reversing all spins and reduces the number of <lb/>amplitudes from 16 to 8. <lb/> •  The identity of initial and final states gives two more conditions, that, referring to Table 3 are: R2  =  R5 and R3  =  R9  = <lb/> R8 (the last identity was already implied by parity conservation). <lb/>We are left with 16/2  −  2  =  6 amplitudes. In Table 4, they are classified with the amplitudes which require a spin–flip of <lb/>the projectile in the right column. <lb/>In case of high energy electrons (where m/E  ≪  1), helicity conservation strongly suppresses the amplitudes R4−R6. We <lb/>consider now the one-photon exchange mechanism for e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − →  p  + ¯ <lb/> p. Only the states R1 and R2 are allowed by the <lb/>quantum number of the photon for the initial e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  and final  ¯ <lb/> pp systems contributing to the cross section. Such two states <lb/>are described by two amplitudes, the (combinations of) electric and magnetic FFs. The state R3 requires  λ =  1. <lb/></body>

			<body> As it can be better seen in the Breit frame, see Eq. (49), a change of helicity of the proton is related to non-spin–flip <lb/>and the electric contribution to the cross section. The magnetic contribution is accompanied by a change of sign of the spin <lb/>component of the proton [21]. <lb/>Note that, in case of identical particles, the Pauli principle gives one more constraint and the number of amplitudes <lb/>reduces to five. The formalism for pp elastic scattering has been derived during the years and can be found in Ref. [22]. If P, <lb/>T and C are conserved separately, the same five amplitudes contribute to  ¯ <lb/> pp  → ¯ <lb/> pp, (and  ¯ <lb/> nn  → ¯ <lb/> nn), taking into account that <lb/>charge conjugation plays the role of Pauli principle in NN scattering [23]. The parity of the e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  or p¯ p system in an orbital S <lb/> is odd, opposite to the pp system in the same state. <lb/>The formalism of helicity amplitudes is very useful to construct states of definite angular momentum out of states <lb/>containing particles of definite helicity, in particular in the decays. <lb/>The calculation, however, may become quite involved when the number of particle increases and/or when polarization <lb/>observables are considered. Let us mention that an extension of this formalism has been suggested in a series of papers [24], <lb/>which allows to express the amplitudes in a frame, called diagonal spin basis. Exact expressions of the transition operator <lb/>can be derived in a convenient form in terms of &apos;&apos;diagonal amplitudes&apos;&apos;. The method is fully covariant and takes into account <lb/>spin and masses of the particles. It has been applied to elastic ep scattering and electromagnetic FFs in Refs. [25–27]. <lb/> 2.7. The annihilation channel <lb/> In the one photon exchange approximation, the annihilation channels  ¯ <lb/> p  +  p  →  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> −  and e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p bring <lb/>the same information on FFs, assuming that the vertices  γ <lb/>  *  pp and  γ <lb/>  *  p¯ p are the same, i.e., assuming charge invariance of the <lb/>electromagnetic interaction. <lb/>The expressions which relate the experimental observables to FFs are briefly recalled below. The annihilation into heavier <lb/>leptons,  µ  or  τ  pairs, contains the same physical information. However one should take into account the lepton mass. <lb/>The formulas in this case are more complicated and their derivation can be found in Ref. [28]. Such experiments have not <lb/>been performed yet. They might bring information on the structure of  µ  or  τ  , if any. The measurement has the advantages <lb/>that photon emission is suppressed by the lepton mass, and radiative corrections are smaller. Moreover, the polarization <lb/>measurement of these particles does not require polarimetry, as it can be measured from the angular distribution of the <lb/>products of their (weak) decays. <lb/> 2.7.1. The annihilation reaction:  ¯ <lb/> p  +  p  →  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − <lb/> The annihilation process <lb/> ¯ <lb/> p(p  1  ) +  p(p  2  ) →  e <lb/> − <lb/> (k  1  ) +  e <lb/> + <lb/> (k  2  ) <lb/> (41) <lb/>is best studied in CMS, where the initial and final four-momenta are: p  1,2  = (±p,  E), k  1,2  = (±k,  E), and moreover <lb/> q <lb/> 2  =  s  = (k  1  +  k  2  ) <lb/> 2  = (p  1  +  p  2  ) <lb/> 2  =  4E <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The differential CMS cross section in Born approximation, that has been obtained in detail in Appendix C.1 and is also <lb/>given in Eq. (C.4), reads <lb/> dσ <lb/>d cos  θ <lb/> = <lb/> π α <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2q 2  β <lb/>  <lb/> (1 +  cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ )|G  M  | <lb/> 2  + <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ |G  E  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> where  β = <lb/>√ <lb/> 1  −  1/τ , with  τ =  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /(4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ≥  1, represents, in CMS, the velocity of the incoming proton. Such a cross section <lb/>contains the moduli of the FFs, indeed they are complex in the TL region. Moreover, they do not depend on the emission <lb/>angle  θ  , between the antiproton and electron three-momenta p and k. Then the total cross section is <lb/> σ (¯  pp  →  e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − <lb/> ) = <lb/> 4π <lb/> 2 <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/> 3q 2  β <lb/>  <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> |G  E  | <lb/> 2  +  2|G  M  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (42) <lb/>For the time reversal process e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p, see Eq.

			<body> Polarization observables <lb/> Polarization phenomena are particularly important in TL region, were FFs are complex. A detailed description of the <lb/> ¯ <lb/> p  +  p  →  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> −  polarized cross section is given in Appendix C.2, we discuss here some specific case. <lb/>The simplest polarization phenomenon, called single spin polarization, is defined when only the proton or the <lb/>antiproton is polarized. Indicating P  1 its polarization vector (P 2  =  0), the only non-zero analyzing power in the reference <lb/>system defined in Appendix C.2 is related to the normal polarization P y  , and the corresponding contribution to the cross <lb/>section, Eq. (C.7) is <lb/>  <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  <lb/> 0 <lb/> A y  = − <lb/> π α <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2β q  2  √ τ <lb/> sin(2θ  )  Im(G  M G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  ). <lb/> This analyzing power, being T -odd, does not vanish, even in one-photon approximation, due to the fact that FFs are com-<lb/>plex in TL region. This is a principal difference with elastic ep scattering. Moreover the assumption G E  =  G M  implies <lb/> (dσ /dΩ)  0  A y  =  0, independently from any model taken for the calculation of FFs. <lb/>The contributions to the cross section in case of polarized proton and antiproton, called double spin observables, are <lb/>given in Eq. (C.8). The &apos;&apos;diagonal&apos;&apos; observables, proportional to A xx  , A yy  and A zz  , depend only on the moduli of FFs, and hence <lb/>do not contain any additional information with respect to the total cross sections of Eqs. (42) and (43). On the other hand, <lb/>the only non vanishing off-diagonal contribution, <lb/>  <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  <lb/> 0 <lb/> A xz  = <lb/>  <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/>  <lb/> 0 <lb/> A zx  = <lb/> π α <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2β q  2  √ τ <lb/> sin(2θ  )  Re <lb/>  <lb/> G M G <lb/>  * <lb/> E <lb/>  <lb/> (45) <lb/>is proportional to the real part of G M G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  and thus it provides information complementary to that of  (dσ /dΩ)  0  A y  . <lb/>In other words, in order to determine the difference between the phases of G E  and G M  , in TL region, the interesting ob-<lb/>servable is either A y  or A xz  depending on the size of the relative phase. Indeed, containing respectively the imaginary and <lb/>the real part of the product G M G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  , they give the sine and cosine of such a phase. <lb/> 2.7.2.

(C.5), is <lb/> dσ  (e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  p¯ p) <lb/>dΩ <lb/> = <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/> β  C <lb/> 4q 2 <lb/>  <lb/> |G  M  | <lb/> 2   <lb/> 1  +  cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> |G  E  | <lb/> 2 sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (47) <lb/>Actually, with respect to Eq. (C.5), Eq. (47) contains an additional factor  C.  It represents a correction which accounts for the <lb/>electromagnetic interaction between proton and antiproton when produced close to the threshold, i.e. for q <lb/> 2  →  4M <lb/> 2 . The <lb/>same correction has to be considered in time reversal process. This factor, at the lowest order in the QED coupling constant  α, <lb/> affects the S-wave only and it may be considered as a final (initial, in case of  ¯ <lb/> p  +  p  →  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> −  annihilation) state interaction <lb/>correction. The correction can be written as [32,33] <lb/> |ψ  L=0  (0)| <lb/> 2  ≡  C  = <lb/> π α/β <lb/> 1  −  exp(−π  α/β) <lb/>, <lb/> (48) <lb/>where  ψ  L=0  (r)  is the wave function solution of the Schrödinger equation with a Coulomb potential and zero orbital angular <lb/>momentum, i.e. L  =  0. In Ref. [34] it has been suggested that this factor can be decomposed in two parts: the enhancement <lb/>factor,  E  , and the Sommerfeld resummation factor,  R,  with <lb/> E  = <lb/> π α <lb/>β <lb/>, <lb/> R  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  −  exp(−π  α/β) <lb/>. <lb/> The main features of the enhancement factor in case of NN production is that the velocity  β  in the denominator cancels the <lb/>phase-space  β  factor, see Eq. (47), so that, at threshold, a step is expected in the cross section. In other words, as q <lb/> 2 reaches <lb/>the threshold 4M <lb/> 2 , the cross section becomes suddenly different from zero, reaching the finite value <lb/> σ (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> α <lb/> 3 <lb/> 2M 2  . <lb/> However, due to the resummation factor, this cancellation disappears just few MeV above the threshold, where the cross <lb/>section rises again as expected according to the opening of the phase space. Actually, due to the finite CMS energy resolution, <lb/>it is not simple to detect this threshold step-wise behavior. The connection of these consideration to the data is discussed <lb/>in Section 4.2.2. <lb/></body>

			<body> 3. Mathematical properties of form factors <lb/> FFs represent the limit values on the real axis of analytic functions defined in the q <lb/> 2 -complex plane, with the unitarity <lb/>cut  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞).  This is a crucial feature that not only imposes constraints on the possible parametrizations, but allows us <lb/>to use mathematical theorems to verify theory predictions (e.g. the asymptotic power-laws) and to connect experimental <lb/>information coming from different kinematical regions. <lb/> 3.1. Hermiticity of the current and reality of form factors <lb/> The hermiticity of the current operator implies that FFs must be real in the SL region, and have to fulfill the Schwarz <lb/>reflection principle in TL region, where they are complex. On the other hand, the validity of the Schwarz reflection principle <lb/>is also a necessary consequence of analyticity, once the FFs are proved to be real on the portion of real axis contained in <lb/>the analyticity domain, that, for the nucleon FFs, corresponds to the q <lb/> 2 -interval  (−∞,  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ),  where m  π  is the charged pion <lb/>mass. A detailed derivation is given in Appendix D.1, in the following we summarize the main steps. <lb/>We consider the transition amplitude, between the two states  |p  i  ⟩  and  |p  f  ⟩,  of a spin 1/2 field, <lb/> ⟨p  f  | ˆ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|p  i  ⟩ =  N  u(p f  ) γ <lb/> µ  u(p i  ), <lb/> (49) <lb/>where ê <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (x)  is the current operator,  N  is a normalization constant and u(p) is a Dirac spinor. In case of a non-pointlike <lb/>particle, for instance the proton, the previous expression can be generalized as <lb/> ⟨p  f  | ˆ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|p  i  ⟩ =  N  u(p f  ) Γ <lb/> µ <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  u(p i  ), <lb/> (50) <lb/>with  Γ <lb/> µ <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  see Eq. (20), <lb/> Γ <lb/> µ <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F  1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) γ <lb/> µ  −  F  2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>σ <lb/> µν  q  ν <lb/> 2M <lb/> , <lb/> (51) <lb/>where F  1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and F  2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are the Dirac and Pauli FFs, and q  =  p f  −  p i  is the momentum transfer. <lb/>The hermiticity of the current operator  <lb/> µ  implies <lb/> ⟨p  f  | ˆ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|p  i  ⟩ <lb/> *  = ⟨p  i  | ˆ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|p  f  ⟩, <lb/> and hence, from Eqs. (50) and (51), <lb/> F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F <lb/>  * <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ). <lb/> In other words, FFs are real in the SL region, indeed, this result has been obtained by considering a SL four-momentum q, <lb/> i.e., q <lb/> 2  = (p  f  −  p i  ) <lb/> 2  ≤  0. <lb/>In TL region, the hadronic vertex is:  γ <lb/>  * <lb/> (q) →  p(p  1  )+p(p  2  ),  with the momentum transfer q  =  p  1  +p  2 , thus the transition <lb/>amplitude reads <lb/> ⟨p  1  p  2  | ˆ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|0⟩ =  u(p  1  ) <lb/>  <lb/> F  1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )γ <lb/> µ  −  F  2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>σ <lb/> µν  q  ν <lb/> 2M <lb/>  <lb/> v(p  2  ). <lb/> The hermiticity condition for the current operator is <lb/> ⟨p  1  p  2  | ˆ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|0⟩ <lb/>  *  = ⟨0| <lb/> µ <lb/> (0)|p  1  p  2  ⟩, <lb/> (52) <lb/>which, if there are no singularities for q <lb/> 2  ≥  0, implies real FFs also in TL region, i.e. <lb/> F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F <lb/>  * <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  for: q <lb/> 2  ≥  0. <lb/>(53) <lb/>This is indeed the case of pointlike fermions where the FFs are constant and real, in particular: F <lb/> point−like <lb/>1 <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  1 and <lb/> F <lb/> point−like <lb/>2 <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  0. <lb/>However, physical FFs are singular in TL region. In fact, as a consequence of the optical theorem, transition amplitudes <lb/>have a discontinuity cut for all q <lb/> 2 values that allow the virtual photon to couple with on-shell intermediate hadronic states. <lb/>Since the lightest of such states is  |π <lb/> + <lb/> π <lb/> − ⟩,  the cut covers the positive q <lb/> 2 half line  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞). <lb/> Such a discontinuity prevents to access the positive q <lb/> 2 real axis, hence, FFs in TL region are given by their values on the <lb/>upper edge of the cut, i.e. for q <lb/> 2  ≥  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  , it is understood: F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  lim  ϵ→0  +  F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2  +  iϵ). <lb/> In light of this, having not only complex FFs, but also complex squared four-momenta, the identity of Eq. (52) implies <lb/> F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2  +  iϵ)  =  F <lb/>  * <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2  −  iϵ)  =  F <lb/>  * <lb/> 1,2 <lb/>  (q <lb/> 2  +  iϵ) <lb/>  *   , <lb/> (54) <lb/>i.e., in TL region, FFs fulfill the Schwarz reflection principle. <lb/>As already stated, this can also be seen as a necessary consequence for FFs that are analytic functions, in the cut complex <lb/>plane and real, for real q <lb/> 2  ∈ (−∞,  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ). <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 4. Feynman diagram for nucleon–pion loop that contributes to the nucleon FFs. Solid and dashed lines represent nucleons and pions respectively. <lb/> 3.2. Dispersion theory <lb/> The dispersion theory studies the analytic properties of FFs as functions of the complex momentum transfer squared q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>Indeed, FFs that have been defined for only real values of q <lb/> 2 , can be analytically continued into the q <lb/> 2 -complex plane. So <lb/>that, the physical values (real q <lb/> 2 ) of the Dirac and Pauli FFs F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  can be defined as the limits, on the upper edge of the <lb/>real axis, of their continuations F  1,2  (z),  i.e., <lb/> F  1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  lim <lb/> z→q  2  +iϵ <lb/> F  1,2  (z), <lb/> (55) <lb/>where  ϵ →  0 <lb/> +  is understood. The functions F  1,2  (z)  are required <lb/>1. to be analytic in the closed upper half plane, Re(z)  ≥  0, except for the branch cut  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞),  on the positive real axis (m  π <lb/> is the pion mass); <lb/>2. to vanish as z  → ∞,  uniformly in Re(z)  ≥  0. <lb/> 3.2.1. Analyticity of form factors <lb/> Analyticity, as given at the first point in Section 3.2, is still not rigorously demonstrated [6]. However, in the framework <lb/>of perturbation theory, it can be proved at any order. It is interesting to see how such a proof can be given, for instance, at <lb/>the first order. <lb/>The contribution to the nucleon FFs of the pion–nucleon loop shown in Fig. 4 is: <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/>  <lb/> d <lb/> 4  k Tr <lb/>  <lb/> 1 <lb/> k  2  −  m  2 <lb/> π <lb/> γ <lb/> 5 <lb/> 1 <lb/> ̸  p  − ̸  k  −  M <lb/> γ <lb/> 5 <lb/> 1 <lb/> (k +  q)  2  −  m  2 <lb/> π <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (56) <lb/>considering a unique, effective nucleon FF, F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ).  Such a simplification does not change the analytic properties under study, <lb/>while it reduces a lot the spinology, otherwise needed. Moreover, following the treatment of Appendix D.2, such a FF has <lb/>the same analyticity of <lb/>   (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>   1 <lb/>0 <lb/> dα  1 <lb/>   1 <lb/>0 <lb/> dα  2 <lb/>   1 <lb/>0 <lb/> dα  3 <lb/> δ <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> 3 <lb/>  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> α  j <lb/>  <lb/> α  1  α  3  q  2  − α <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  M  2  − (1 − α  2  )m  2 <lb/> π  +  iϵ <lb/> , <lb/> (57) <lb/>where, according to the usual procedure, a small and positive imaginary part has been added to the masses to remove the <lb/>poles away from the real axis. It follows that  <lb/>   (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is analytic in the upper half q <lb/> 2 -complex plane. <lb/>Using physical considerations, it is possible to show that there exist real values of q <lb/> 2 at which  <lb/>   (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is real, so that it can <lb/>be analytically continued from the upper to the lower half q <lb/> 2 -complex plane by means of the Schwarz reflection principle <lb/>(see. Appendix D.2). <lb/>However, singularities appear for TL momenta, in particular the integrand has poles for any real q <lb/> 2  ≥  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  . As a <lb/>consequence, the function ñ <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  and so the FF F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  which share the same analytic structure, acquire a discontinuity cut <lb/>along the real axis, from the threshold q <lb/> 2  =  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  up to infinity. <lb/> 3.2.2. The asymptotic behavior of form factors <lb/> The analytic properties of FFs have also the important consequence that they are bounded functions for all finite values <lb/>of q <lb/> 2 . In fact, the complex poles, that represent the resonant contributions, must lie in the so-called unphysical sheets, i.e., <lb/>in the secondary Riemann planes, otherwise they would spoil the analyticity. <lb/>Another crucial feature of FFs, is the power-law asymptotic behavior in the SL region, that follows from dimensional <lb/>counting rule or pQCD [35,36]. In particular, the Dirac and Pauli FFs, in the SL region, as  (−q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) → ∞,  scale like <lb/> F i  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →−∞ <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2    −1−i  ,  i  =  1, 2, <lb/></body>

			<body> while the Sachs, electric and magnetic FFs, have the same power-law <lb/> G E,M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →−∞ <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2    −2  . <lb/> These additional regularities allow to apply, to the FFs, the Phragmèn–Lindelöf (P–L) theorem [37], which states that the SL <lb/>asymptotic behavior can be extended to any direction in the q <lb/> 2 complex plane. A detailed demonstration, in case of Sachs <lb/>FFs, is given in Appendix D.3. <lb/>The main result is that, following Eq. (D.19), is that a given FF, for instance G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  not only scales with the same power <lb/>in both SL and TL limit, i.e., <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →−∞ <lb/> G SL <lb/> (q  2  )  2  , <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/> G TL <lb/> (q  2  )  2  , <lb/> (58) <lb/>but also that the constant coefficients G SL  , G TL  coincides, then <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> G M  (−q  2  ) <lb/> −−−→ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/> 1. <lb/>(59) <lb/>As an obvious consequence, since in the SL region the FF is real, TL limit is also real. In other words, as q <lb/> 2 diverges in TL <lb/>region, the imaginary part of G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  vanishes faster than the real part, that is: the phase, arg[G  M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )],  goes to an integer <lb/>multiple of 2π radians. This result can be applied to each FF. <lb/> 3.2.3. Dispersion relation for the imaginary and real parts <lb/> Assuming for a generic FF, F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  the properties illustrated in the two items of Section 3.2, we can use the Cauchy integral <lb/>theorem to represent the FF in a generic q <lb/> 2 value with Im(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) &gt;  0 as <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2iπ <lb/>   ∞ <lb/>−∞ <lb/> F  (q <lb/> ′2 <lb/> ) <lb/> q  ′2 −  q  2  −  iϵ <lb/>dq <lb/> ′2 <lb/> . <lb/> (60) <lb/>Moreover, using the Schwarz reflection principle and the fact that F  (t)  is real for real values of t  ≤  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  =  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  , the so called <lb/>DR for the imaginary part is derived: <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 1 <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)] <lb/> t  −  q  2  dt,  ∀  q <lb/> 2  ̸ ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞), <lb/> (61) <lb/>where it is understood that the imaginary part is evaluated over the upper edge of the cut  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞).  This DR establishes <lb/>a connection between the imaginary part of a FF, on the upper edge of the cut, and its value in a generic complex q <lb/> 2 . In <lb/>particular, for q <lb/> 2 real and negative, the connection is between TL and SL values of the FF. <lb/>The integral representation of Eq. (61) can be also extended to values of q <lb/> 2 that lie on the upper edge of the cut, i.e., for <lb/> q <lb/> 2  →  s  +  iϵ, with s  ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞)  and  ϵ →  0 <lb/> +  . In this case we use the Sokhotski–Plemelj formula [38], in terms of the Cauchy <lb/>principal value (PV), given in Appendix D.4, to obtain an expression for the real part of the FF over the cut, i.e., <lb/>Re[F  (s)] = <lb/> 1 <lb/> π <lb/> PV <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)] <lb/> t  −  s <lb/>dt, <lb/> (62) <lb/>where the term iϵ in the left-hand side is omitted. The last identity is the DR for the real part. <lb/>DRs can be used also in case of FFs having the generic power-law asymptotic behavior, even divergent as, for instance, <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2    1−ν  , <lb/> with 0  &lt; ν &lt;  1. The general procedure to treat such cases is described in Appendix D.4. In particular, for this example, we <lb/>choose a suitable value s  0 where the FF is not only analytic but also experimentally or theoretically known, for instance a <lb/>real s  0  &lt;  s  t , and consider the DR of Eq. (61), but for the function <lb/> G(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) −  F  (s  0  ) <lb/> q  2  −  s  0 <lb/> . <lb/> This function has the same analytic properties of F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and, in addition, it is asymptotically vanishing as <lb/> G(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2    −1 ∝ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2    −ν  , <lb/> being  ν &lt;  0. <lb/></body>

			<body> From DRs of Eqs. (61) and (62) for G(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  we get <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F  (s  0  ) + <lb/> q <lb/> 2  −  s  0 <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)] <lb/> t(t  −  q  2  ) <lb/> dt, <lb/> Re[F  (s)] =  F  (s  0  ) + <lb/> s  −  s  0 <lb/> π <lb/> PV <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)] <lb/> t(t  −  s) <lb/>dt, <lb/> (63) <lb/>with: q <lb/> 2  ̸ ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞),  s  =  s <lb/> ′ +  iϵ, s  ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞)  and  ϵ →  0 <lb/> +  . <lb/>These are the so-called DR for imaginary and real parts subtracted (once) in q <lb/> 2  =  s  0 . To exploit such integral representa-<lb/>tions, however, the FF must be known not only over the TL cut but also at an arbitrary q <lb/> 2  ̸ ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞),  the subtraction point. <lb/>As discussed in Appendix D.4, if the asymptotic behavior has a higher order of divergence, a larger number of subtractions <lb/>is needed, so that besides the value of FF at the subtraction point, we also have to know the values of a certain number of its <lb/>derivatives. <lb/> 3.2.4. Convergence and super-convergence relations for physical form factors <lb/> The values that FFs assume at q <lb/> 2  =  0 are connected to static properties of the described hadrons, as for instance: electric <lb/>charge and magnetic moment, and hence they are experimentally and theoretically well known. Moreover, counting rules <lb/>and pQCD [35,36] impose to FFs power-law vanishing behavior, as the squared momentum transfer increases. For nucleon <lb/>Sachs FFs the expected behavior is <lb/> G E,M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2    −2  . <lb/> In such a case we can use the DR of Eq. (61) at q <lb/> 2  =  0, to obtain the convergence relation <lb/> F  (0) = <lb/> 1 <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)] <lb/> t <lb/>dt, <lb/> which can be used to constraint the asymptotic behavior, once experimentally known at low q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>From the same DR, in the SL limit q <lb/> 2  → −∞,  we obtain the so-called super-convergence relation <lb/>0  = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)]  dt, <lb/> this implies that the imaginary part has to change sign. Moreover, assuming the generic power-law behavior <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2    −n  , <lb/> with integer n  ≥  2, we can write super-convergence relations for the  (n −  1) functions: F  (t),  tF  (t), . . . ,  t <lb/> n−2 F  (t),  i.e., for <lb/> F  (t)  and its first  (n −  2) momenta, so that: <lb/>0  = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[F  (t)]  dt  = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> t Im[F  (t)]  dt  = · · · = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> t <lb/> n−2  Im[F  (t)]  dt. <lb/> (64) <lb/>The previous identities can be also given in a more compact form as <lb/>0  = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> P m  (t)  Im[F  (t)]  dt, <lb/> (65) <lb/>where P m  (t)  is a generic m-degree polynomials with m  ≤  n  −  2. <lb/> 3.2.5. Dispersion relation for the logarithm <lb/> In the DRs for imaginary and real part, given in Eqs. (61) and (62), the integral representation is always written in terms <lb/>of the imaginary part of the FF in TL region. However, in most of the cases, data in such a region concern the moduli of FFs, <lb/>that are extracted, for instance, from the differential cross section of the e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  -annihilation process (see Section 4.2). <lb/>Thus, to exploit the possibility of using directly the data, it is useful to consider a DR written in terms of the FF modulus, <lb/>instead of its imaginary part. This can be done, following the development detailed in Appendix D.5. In particular, assuming <lb/>that the FF has no zeros in the whole q <lb/> 2 -complex, the so-called &apos;DR for the logarithm&apos; can be written, see Eq. (D.28): <lb/>ln[F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )] =  ln[F  (0)] + <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> iπ <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/>(t −  q  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt. <lb/> (66) <lb/>In other words, the value of the FF in a generic complex q <lb/> 2 not belonging to the cut  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞),  is completely determined by <lb/>its modulus over the cut, i.e.,  |F (t)|  evaluated for TL transfer momenta, with t  ≥  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t . <lb/></body>

			<body> For q <lb/> 2 values lying on the upper edge of the cut, i.e., s  =  q <lb/> 2  +  iϵ,  ϵ →  0 <lb/> +  and q <lb/> 2  ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞),  we obtain a DR for the phase <lb/> δ(s) =  arg [F  (s)]  on the upper edge of the cut: <lb/> δ(s) = − <lb/>  <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> π <lb/> PV <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/>(t −  s) <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt, <lb/> (67) <lb/>where, for the variable s, the positive vanishing imaginary part is understood. <lb/>Even though, in case of DR for the logarithm, the integrand vanishes fast enough to ensure always the convergence, we <lb/>may need to improve such a vanishing behavior to achieve results less model-dependent. Indeed, the model dependence <lb/>due to the power-law asymptotic behavior (in which, in any case, we should rely to perform the DR integration) is reduced <lb/>by faster vanishing kernels and thus faster converging integrals. <lb/>As discussed in previous Section 3.2.3 and Appendix D.4, such kernels can be obtained by making subtractions, see Eqs. <lb/>(63), (D.24) and (D.25). In the simplest case where there is a subtraction at q <lb/> 2  =  0, we have DRs of Eq. (D.29), that in fact <lb/>have a further factor 1/t in the kernel. <lb/>A superconvergence relation is obtained by considering the DR of Eq. (66) with q <lb/> 2  =  0, i.e., <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/> t <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  =  0. <lb/>(68) <lb/>Such an identity implies that the modulus of the FF in TL region assumes values both greater and lower than its absolute <lb/>value at q <lb/> 2  =  0. In other words, since usually  |F (0)|  represents the maximum of the modulus of the FF in SL region, that is <lb/>for  |F (t)|  with t  ≤  0, we may conclude that the main contributions to the FF should lie in TL region. <lb/> 3.2.6. Dispersion relation for the logarithm with zeros <lb/> The DRs of Eqs. (66) and (67) can be generalized to the case where the FF has a finite number of zeros  {z  k  } <lb/> N <lb/>k=1  . Since FFs <lb/>fulfill the Schwarz reflection principle, non-real zeros must appear in pairs of complex conjugates. So that, the set of zeros <lb/>can be defined as <lb/>  <lb/> {r  j  } <lb/> n <lb/>j=1  ; {p  k  } <lb/> m <lb/>k=1  ; {p <lb/> * <lb/> k  } <lb/> m <lb/>k=1 <lb/>  <lb/> , with N  =  n  +  2m, where r j  and p k  are real and non-real zeros. In the light of <lb/>that, the sum of logarithms in Eq. (D.34), for real q <lb/> 2 and q <lb/> 2  ≤  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t , can be rewritten as <lb/> C  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ≡ <lb/> N <lb/>  <lb/> k=1 <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> z k  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  − <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/>  <lb/> z k  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  + <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/> n <lb/>  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  r j  − <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  r j  + <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> −  2i <lb/> m <lb/>  <lb/> k=1 <lb/> arctan <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  q  2 Re <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> p k  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/>  <lb/> |p  k  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  | −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  +  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (69) <lb/>If, instead, q <lb/> 2 lies over the cut, hence q <lb/> 2  =  s  +  iϵ, with s  ∈ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞)  and  ϵ →  0 <lb/> +  , we have <lb/> C  (s) =  2i <lb/> n <lb/>  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> arctan <lb/>   <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  r j <lb/>  <lb/> +  2 <lb/> m <lb/>  <lb/> k=1 <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> p k  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  − <lb/>  <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/>  <lb/> p k  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  + <lb/>  <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> . <lb/> (70) <lb/>In terms of these functions, the DRs for logarithm and phase become <lb/>ln[F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )] =  ln[F  (0)] + <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> iπ <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/>(t −  q  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  +  iπ N r  +  C  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> (71) <lb/> δ(s) = − <lb/>  <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> π <lb/> PV <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/>(t −  s) <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  + π  N r  −  iC  (s), <lb/> where N r  is the number of real zero lying between q <lb/> 2  =  0 and the threshold q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t . <lb/>In the simple case where there is a SL real zero q <lb/> 2  =  r  1  &lt;  0 the previous DRs become <lb/>ln[F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )] =  ln[F  (0)] + <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> iπ <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/>(t −  q  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  +  ln <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  r  1  − <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  r  1  + <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/>δ(s) = − <lb/>  <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> π <lb/> PV <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/>(t −  s) <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  +  2 arctan <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> s  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  r  1 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/></body>

			<body> 3.2.7. Nucleon radii <lb/> As already discussed in Sections 1 and 2.2, FFs in the Breit system represent the Fourier transforms of electric charge and <lb/>magnetization spatial distributions of nucleons. As a consequence, using Eqs. (7) and (8), that can be applied to all nucleon <lb/>FFs, mean square radii can be obtained in terms of FFs as <lb/>  <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/> E,M <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/> 6 <lb/> G E,M  (0) <lb/> dG E,M <lb/> dq  2 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> q  2  =0 <lb/> . <lb/> (72) <lb/>Experimental evaluations are quite difficult, because, being strongly dependent on the slope of the FF at q <lb/> 2  =  0, require <lb/>measurements of cross sections at arbitrarily small transferred momenta, which are in principle impossible to obtain. Hence, <lb/>the usual procedure to determine such radii consists in fitting the low-Q <lb/> 2 data and taking the analytic derivative at q <lb/> 2  =  0 <lb/>of the fit function. It is interesting, by the way, to notice that mean square radii are proportional to the logarithmic derivative <lb/>of the corresponding FF in the origin and hence do not depend on the normalization. <lb/>Using the DR for the logarithm of Eq. (66), hence assuming that the FF has no zeros, and taking its first derivative at <lb/> q <lb/> 2  =  0, we get directly <lb/>  <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/> E,M <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/> 6 <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |G  E,M  (t)/G  E,M  (0)| <lb/> t  2 <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt. <lb/> (73) <lb/>On the other hand, if the FF has zeros, we can use the DR of Eq. (71) <lb/>  <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/> E,M <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/> 6 <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |G  E,M  (t)/G  E,M  (0)| <lb/> t  2 <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  +  6 <lb/> dC <lb/>dq  2 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> q  2  =0 <lb/> , <lb/> where the function C  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  given in Eq. (69), is defined in terms of the zeros of the FF. In the simple case where the FF has <lb/>only one real SL zero, q <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  &lt;  0, with G E,M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  ) =  0, the mean square radius reads <lb/>  <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/> E,M <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/> 6 <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> ln  |G  E,M  (t)/G  E,M  (0)| <lb/> t  2 <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt  − <lb/> 6 <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> . <lb/> (74) <lb/>Also the DR for the imaginary part of Eq. (61) can be used and we get <lb/>  <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/> E,M <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/> 6 <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[G  E,M  (t)]/G  E,M  (0) <lb/> t  2 <lb/> dt. <lb/> (75) <lb/>All these expressions give the mean square radii in terms of integrals of moduli or imaginary parts of FFs over the TL cut, <lb/>this means that: TL data, as well as asymptotic behaviors, can be also exploited to determine FF derivatives at q <lb/> 2  =  0. <lb/>In particular, from Eq. (73), we can deduce that the main contribution to FFs lies at low t values. Indeed, since FFs are <lb/> O <lb/>  <lb/> t <lb/> −2   <lb/> as t  → ∞,  there exists a minimum TL value t  asy  &gt;  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t , so that: ln  |G  E,M  (t)/G  E,M  (0)| &lt;  0 for t  &gt;  t  asy and thus the <lb/>DR integral over the corresponding half line  (t  asy  , ∞)  is negative. Having positive radii, this contribution is exceeded by the <lb/>remaining part of the integral. In other words, in the finite interval  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  ,  t  asy  ),  it must be  |G  E,M  (t)| ≫ |G  E,M  (0)|,  i.e., FFs give <lb/>their main contribution. <lb/>Such an argument, about the TL low-q <lb/> 2 dominance of FFs, is also reinforced in the case of a FF with a unique SL zero, that, <lb/>as it is shown in Eq. (74), implies a further negative contribution to be compensated and exceeded. <lb/>Finally, considering the DR for the imaginary part, similar conclusions on the TL behavior of FFs can be also drawn. In <lb/>particular, from Eq. (75) follows that imaginary parts of FFs give their main contribution at low-t values, where it must <lb/>be Im[G  E,M  (t)]/G  E,M  (0) ≫  0. Assuming that FFs are described in terms of a combination of intermediate resonances, that <lb/>couple to the virtual photon, see Section 5.1. This result can be exploited to constraint corresponding coupling constants <lb/>and relative phases. <lb/> 3.2.8. Phase of form factors <lb/> The generalized Levinson theorem [39], which is recalled in Appendix D.7, can be summarized by this relation (see Eq. <lb/>(D.39)): <lb/> φ(∞) − φ(x  0  ) = π (N −  M), <lb/> (76) <lb/>where  φ(z)  is the phase of a function F  (z),  i.e., F  (z) = |F (z)|e <lb/> iφ(z)  , which has: N zeros,  {z  j  } <lb/> N <lb/>j=1  , M poles,  {p  k  } <lb/> M <lb/>k=1  , with <lb/> {z  j  } <lb/> N <lb/>j=1  ∩ {p  k  } <lb/> M <lb/>k=1  = ∅  (poles and zeros are counted with their multiplicities), the cut  (x  0  , ∞)  along the real axis, and tends <lb/>uniformly to a finite and non-vanishing limit, as z  → ∞. <lb/> Eq. (76) states that the difference between the values of the phase at the two diramation points: z  =  x  0 and z  = ∞, <lb/> coincides, in units of  π  radians, with the difference between the numbers of zeros and poles. <lb/>This result, with the opportune adjustments, can be applied to FFs. As we have seen so far, FFs fulfill all analyticity <lb/>requirements needed to apply the theorem and hence to deduce the relation of Eq. (76). In addition, FFs have no poles being <lb/></body>

			<body> analytic in the whole q <lb/> 2 complex plane, apart from the cut  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞).  The only important difference between a generic <lb/>FF, say G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  and the function F  (z)  concerns the asymptotic behavior: G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  vanishes uniformly as q <lb/> 2 diverges, hence <lb/>its logarithmic derivative is not integrable at infinity, contrary to F  (z).  As we have already done when we treated the P–L <lb/>theorem in Section 3.2.2 and Appendix D.3, since the asymptotic behavior is known, we can rescale the FF with the opportune <lb/>power of q <lb/> 2 in order to have a constant finite limit at infinity. <lb/>Having that G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> −2  as q <lb/> 2  → ∞,  we define <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2  G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> which, with respect to the FF, has only an additional zero of order two in the origin, due to the factor  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 . It follows that, <lb/>for real values of q <lb/> 2 , F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  have the same phase and hence, from the Levinson&apos;s theorem, we have <lb/> θ (∞) − θ (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ) = θ (∞) = π (N  G  +  2), <lb/>where N G  is the number of zeros of G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and  θ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  its phase, that we assume to be zero at the threshold q <lb/> 2  =  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  . <lb/>This result can be generalized to the case of a FF with an arbitrary asymptotic behavior G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> −N  A  , N A  ∈  N,  for <lb/>which we would have <lb/> θ (∞) = π (N  G  +  N A  ). <lb/> (77) <lb/>In other words, under the assumptions we have done, that are quite reasonable and physically well established, the asymp-<lb/>totic limit of the phase of a FF (in TL region) is &apos;&apos;quantized&apos;&apos; in units of  π  radians. The value  θ (∞)/π  gives crucial information <lb/>of the asymptotic power-law and also on the possible presence of zeros. <lb/> 4. Experiments: past, present, and future <lb/> In this section, a comprehensive review of the experimental data is given, underlying the most significative results and <lb/>the expected progress at ongoing and future facilities. <lb/> 4 <lb/> The elegant QED formalism described in Section 2 relates measured quantities, as differential cross section and <lb/>polarization observables to FFs. The unpolarized differential cross section is expressed in terms of FFs squared (moduli in <lb/>TL region), Eq. (29). During the last century, unpolarized electron–proton scattering was the only way to access FFs in SL <lb/>region. The main limitation of this method appears at large momentum-transfer where the cross section is dominated by <lb/>the magnetic contribution and radiative corrections become very significant. Polarization experiments, although suggested <lb/>much earlier [4], could be realized only with the advent of high-intensity electron beams, large acceptance detectors and <lb/>due to the tremendous progress in polarization techniques for beams, targets and hadron polarimetry. <lb/>Specific polarization observables are more sensitive to small amplitudes because they are related to interference terms, <lb/>i.e., to the product G E G M  in the SL region and G E G <lb/>  * <lb/> M  in TL region. Moreover they allow to determine the sign of the FFs, <lb/>in the SL region, and their relative phase in the TL region. The separation of electric and magnetic FFs requires, in the SL <lb/>region the measurement of the differential cross section at different angles for fixed q <lb/> 2 : each setting requires to change the <lb/>incident energy and the detection angle. In the TL region it is in principle more simple, because it is necessary a complete <lb/>measurement of the angular distribution at fixed energy. However the luminosity of the machines has not allowed, so far, <lb/>the separation of  |G  E  |  and  |G  M  |.  At large q <lb/> 2 , for  τ ≫  1, the differential cross-section dσ  /dΩ  e  (with unpolarized particles) <lb/>is insensitive to G E  : the corresponding combination of the nucleon FFs is dominated by the G M  contribution, due to the <lb/>following reasons: <lb/> •  G M  /G  E  ≃ µ  p  , where  µ  p  is the proton magnetic moment, so G <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  /G <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  ≃  2.79 <lb/> 2  ≃  9; <lb/> •  the magnetic contribution increases at large momentum transfer, as  τ  increases. <lb/>Therefore unpolarized ep-scattering is dominated by the magnetic term, at large values of momentum transfer. The same <lb/>holds for en-scattering, even at relatively small values of q <lb/> 2 , due to the small value of the neutron electric FF. The precise <lb/>determination of the proton electric FF, in the region of large momentum transfer, and for the neutron electric FF — at any <lb/>value of q <lb/> 2 , requires polarization measurements and in particular those polarization observables which are determined by <lb/>the product G E G M  , and are, therefore, more sensitive to G E  . <lb/>There are at least two different classes of polarization experiments of such type: the scattering of longitudinally polarized <lb/>electrons by polarized target (with polarization in the reaction plane, but perpendicular to the direction of the three-<lb/>momentum transfer)  ⃗  e  + ⃗ <lb/> p  →  e  +  p, or the measurement of the ratio of transversal to longitudinal proton polarization <lb/>(in the reaction plane) for the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons by unpolarized target,  ⃗  e  +  p  →  e  + ⃗ <lb/> p. <lb/> In principle, there are some components of the depolarization tensor characterizing the dependence of the final proton <lb/>polarization on the target polarization, for the scattering of unpolarized electrons, e+  ⃗ <lb/> p  →  e+  ⃗ <lb/> p, which are also proportional <lb/>to G E G M  , and therefore can be used for the determination of the nucleon electric FF [4,5,40]. <lb/>Both experiments (with polarized electron beam) have been realized: p(⃗ e,  ⃗ <lb/> p)e for the determination of the proton electric <lb/>FF, G Ep  and, for the determination of the neutron electric FF, G En  , d(⃗ e, e <lb/> ′ ⃗ <lb/> n)p and d(⃗ e, e <lb/> ′  n)⃗ p. <lb/></body>

Contribution of the G E  (Q <lb/> 2  )  dependent term to the reduced cross section (in percent) for  ϵ =  0.2 (solid line),  ϵ =  0.5 (dashed line),  ϵ =  0.8 <lb/>(dash-dotted line), in the hypothesis of FF scaling (thin lines) or following Eq. (78) (thick lines). <lb/> At large Q <lb/> 2 the contribution of the electric term to the cross section becomes very small, as the magnetic part is amplified <lb/>by the kinematical factor  τ  . This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the ratio of the electric part to the reduced cross section <lb/> ϵG <lb/> 2 <lb/> E  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )/σ  red  (θ ,  Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  is shown as a function of Q <lb/> 2 , for different values of  ϵ.  The different curves correspond to different <lb/>values of  ϵ,  assuming FF scaling or following the parametrization of FFs ratio suggested by polarization measurements: <lb/> µG  E  /G  M  =  1 for Q <lb/> 2  ≤  0.4 GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/>µG  E  /G  M  =  1.0587  −  0.14265Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> for Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &gt;  0.4 GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (78) <lb/>In the second case (thick lines), one can see that, for example, for  ϵ =  0.2 the electric contribution becomes lower than 3% <lb/>starting from 2 GeV <lb/> 2 [41]. This number should be compared with the absolute uncertainty of the cross section measurement: <lb/>when they are of the same order, the sensitivity of the measurement to the electric term is lost and the extraction of G E <lb/> becomes meaningless. <lb/>In TL region, all the information on the nucleon structure as well as on the reaction mechanism, is contained in the <lb/>differential cross section. The electric term is accompanied by a dependence in sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  . It means that, whatever is the model <lb/>used for  |G  E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| <lb/> 2 , it has a maximum at cos  θ =  0 and vanishes at cos  θ = ±1.  The magnetic term has a maximum at <lb/>cos  θ = ±1,  which equals to 2τ  |G  M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| <lb/> 2 and a minimum at cos  θ =  0, which equals to  τ |G  M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| <lb/> 2 . The relative electric and <lb/>magnetic contributions to the differential cross section F M  and F E  , are illustrated as functions of cos  θ  for q <lb/> 2  =  5 and 8 GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> in Fig. 6 left panel. <lb/>Therefore, in TL region, the individual determination of  |G  E  |  and  |G  M  |  requires the measurement of the angular <lb/>distribution of the outgoing leptons, at fixed total energy s  =  q <lb/> 2 and it is, in principle, simpler than in SL region where the <lb/>Rosenbluth separation requires at least two measurements at fixed q <lb/> 2 and different angles implying a change of incident <lb/>energy and scattered electron angle at each q <lb/> 2 point. <lb/>In order to enhance the different angular behavior of the electric and magnetic terms with respect to  θ = π /2,  let us in-<lb/>troduce an angular asymmetry,  A.  One can express the angular dependence of the differential cross section in terms of  A  as: <lb/> dσ <lb/>d(cos  θ ) <lb/> = σ  0 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  +  A  cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ <lb/>  , <lb/> (79) <lb/>where  σ  0 , the differential cross section at  θ = π /2,  and  A  can be written as functions of the FFs as: <lb/> σ  0  = <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4q 2 <lb/>  τ <lb/>τ −  1 <lb/>  <lb/> |G  M  | <lb/> 2  + <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> |G  E  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> ; <lb/> A  = <lb/> τ |G  M  | <lb/> 2  − |G  E  | <lb/> 2 <lb/> τ |G  M  |  2  + |G  E  |  2  = <lb/> τ −  R <lb/> 2 <lb/> τ +  R  2  , <lb/> R  = <lb/>|G  E  | <lb/>|G  M  | <lb/> . <lb/> (80) <lb/>The angular asymmetry  A  lies in the range  −1 ≤  A  ≤  1. For  |G  E  | =  0 one obtains  A  =  1 and for  |G  E  | = |G  M  |  one obtains <lb/> A  = (τ −  1)/(τ  +  1). <lb/>The relative electric and magnetic contributions to the total cross section and to the angular asymmetry, A M  , A E  , are <lb/>illustrated, as function of  θ  and in Fig. 6 right panel, as function of q <lb/> 2 . The unphysical region is indicated by a dashed area. <lb/>Although the magnetic contribution largely dominates in the physical region, the relative contribution of the electric term <lb/>to the cross section is larger than 10% for q <lb/> 2  ≤  15 GeV <lb/> 2 , and it contributes even more to the angular asymmetry. <lb/>From the total cross section, it is possible to extract  |G  M  |  under a definite hypothesis on the FFs. The experimental results <lb/>are usually given in terms of  |G  M  |,  under the hypothesis that G E  =  0 or  |G  E  | = |G  M  |.  The first hypothesis is arbitrary whereas <lb/>the second one is strictly valid at threshold only, and there is no theoretical argument which justifies its validity at any other <lb/></body>

Data in space-like region <lb/> Since the earliest experiments, unpolarized cross section measurements for ep elastic scattering have been considered <lb/>the privileged tool for extracting hadron FFs. Several experiments have been performed during the years, starting from <lb/>single arm experiments, where only the lepton is (magnetically) analyzed, to coincidence experiments, where the scattered <lb/>electron and proton are detected. Note that a precise full determination of the four momenta of both particles has not yet <lb/>been reported. Experiments differ also for the model of radiative corrections which has been applied. Typically, first order <lb/>radiative corrections can reach several tens of percent on the unpolarized cross section at large Q <lb/> 2 , whereas they cancel (at <lb/>least those which factorize out) in the polarization ratio. <lb/>From unpolarized cross section measurements the determination of G E  and G M  has been done up to Q <lb/> 2  ≃  8.8 GeV <lb/> 2 [42] <lb/>and G M  has been extracted up to Q <lb/> 2  ≃  31 GeV <lb/> 2 [43] under the assumption that G E  =  0 or G E  =  G M  /µ  p  . <lb/> 4.1.1. Unpolarized differential cross section measurements <lb/> Since the pioneering experiments of Hofstadter [44], further measurements have been performed at SLAC increasing the <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 range up to Q <lb/> 2  =  31 GeV <lb/> 2 , and improving the experimental errors [42,45–49]. <lb/>Concerning the data published before 1963, we will refer to the comprehensive collection and review from Ref. [50]. In <lb/>Ref. [48] cross section measurements were published for 2.5  ≤  Q <lb/> 2  ≤  31 GeV <lb/> 2 and G M  was extracted assuming G E  =  G M  /µ  p  . <lb/>Radiative corrections were applied according to Ref. [51] and experimentally checked by measurements with different target <lb/>length. Note that radiative corrections were quite large, reaching 50%. <lb/>A series of measurements at DESY [52] (single arm), at Cambridge electron accelerator with ep coincidence from proton <lb/>[53] and from quasi-elastic deuteron scattering [54], found a decrease of the electric FF with Q <lb/> 2 , in the limit of the errors. <lb/>In these experiments radiative corrections were either measured, or controlled through a comparison between hydrogen <lb/>and deuterium targets, and never exceeded 20%. Further measurements at Mainz [55] as well as the SLAC experiment [46] <lb/>showed also a tendency of a deviation of the ratio R  = µ  p G E  /G  M  from unity, for Q <lb/> 2  ≥  1 GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>A dedicated measurement at JLab [56] as well as reanalysis of data [57] confirmed the scaling FFs behavior: G E  ≃  G M  /µ  p  . <lb/>Recently the low Q <lb/> 2 region was under scrutiny with the aim of a precise determination of the charge radius of the <lb/>proton. More then 1400 unpolarized cross sections were measured at Mainz by A1 Collaboration [58,59], in the range <lb/>0.004  ≤  Q <lb/> 2  ≤  1, with a statistical precision below the percent. FFs were extracted either from Rosenbluth separation, <lb/>or from a global fit to the cross section. The extracted charge radius is consistent with previous ep elastic scattering <lb/></body>

[59] the extrapolation to Q <lb/> 2  →  0 included also a reanalysis of the polarized and unpolarized world <lb/>data at larger Q <lb/> 2 . In order to have some consistency among the data, after applying different kinds of corrections, including <lb/>radiative, and various model-dependent two-photon exchange corrections, the normalization among different sets of data <lb/>was eventually kept as a parameter. <lb/>The data on G M  , extracted from the unpolarized measurements are collected in Fig. 7. The values are divided by the <lb/>proton magnetic moment  µ  p  and by the dipole function, in such a way that the static value is unity. Instead of the electric <lb/>FF (scaled or not by dipole), the experimental information on G E  is collected in Fig. 8 as the ratio  µ  p G E  /G  M  . The reason is <lb/>twofold. First of all, in unpolarized Rosenbluth experiments, each set of data for G E  is accompanied by corresponding data <lb/>for G M  , (the inverse is not necessarily true, as G M  has been extracted at large Q <lb/> 2 under some hypothesis on G E  ). Secondly, <lb/>in the ratio G E  /G  M  (corresponding to the ratio of two parameters of a fit), some systematic errors cancel, in particular the <lb/>corrections to the cross section which are multiplicative factors. Gray bands in both figures represent FFs extracted by the <lb/>A1 Collaboration [58,59] using a procedure which consists in fitting the cross section with the Rosenbluth formula of Eq. <lb/>(27) where, for the FFs, a description in terms of cubic splines has been considered. The width of the band, depending on <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 , accounts for statistical and systematic errors. The last one are experimental and theoretical (mostly due to the model-<lb/>dependent two-photon process description). <lb/> 4.1.2. Polarization transfer measurements <lb/> Polarization phenomena were studied and the relevant formalism was developed by the Kharkov school since the mid <lb/>of last century see Ref. [4,5] and references therein, later on in Ref. [61] and extended to the deuteron in Ref. [40]. In <lb/>SL region, the unpolarized cross section contains square FFs, whereas polarization observables contain the interference <lb/>of the amplitudes and are more sensitive to the small electric contribution. Moreover the interference gives access to <lb/>the sign. <lb/>The sign is not an issue for the electric proton FFs, where the static value is unity. For the neutron FFs, which starts from a <lb/>static value of zero, even at small Q <lb/> 2 it is important to determine the sign, also for the determination of the neutron radius, <lb/>where the slope at Q <lb/> 2  →  0 plays the crucial role. Note that polarization experiments are fundamental for the extraction <lb/>of neutron FFs starting from low Q <lb/> 2 , due to their small value. A review of neutron FFs should be object of a separate work, <lb/>as it involves detailed discussion on deuteron and <lb/> 3 <lb/> He structure, including different types of N–N interaction potentials and <lb/>nuclear corrections (see, for example, Ref. [62] and references therein). <lb/>As derived in 2.5.2, the ratio of G E  /G  M  is directly related to the ratio of longitudinal to transverse polarization of the <lb/>scattered proton in longitudinally polarized electron–proton scattering on unpolarized target. The measurement of this <lb/>ratio is expected to give very precise results, because, at first order, the beam helicity as well as the analyzing power of the <lb/>proton polarimeter cancel, reducing the systematic errors. <lb/>The technology of polarized beams, target, and hadron polarimeters necessary to realize such experiments became <lb/>available only recently. The first experiment which extracted the ratio G E  /G  M  using a longitudinally polarized electron beam <lb/>and measuring the transverse over longitudinal polarization of the scattered proton was done at MIT-Bates at two values of <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 near 1 GeV <lb/> 2 [63]. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 8. World data on G E  /µ  p G M  as a function of Q <lb/> 2 from unpolarized ep elastic scattering. Symbols as in Fig. 7, i.e.: Ref. [50] (empty circles), Ref.

[58,59]. <lb/> Later on such technique was used by the JLab GEp collaboration in a series of experiments, extending the range of Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> up to 8.9 GeV <lb/> 2 . The first experiment, up to Q <lb/> 2  =  3.5 GeV <lb/> 2 [64], detected the electron and proton in two identical high <lb/>resolution spectrometers of Hall A. It already showed the high precision achievable, but also the surprising result, confirmed <lb/>by the subsequent measurements, that the electric and magnetic FFs have a different Q <lb/> 2 dependence, contrary to what <lb/>was previously assumed on the basis of the unpolarized measurements. A detailed description of this measurement was <lb/>published in Ref. [65]. In order to reach larger values of Q <lb/> 2 , up to 5.6 GeV <lb/> 2 the spectrometer for the electron detection <lb/>was replaced by a lead glass calorimeter [66]. Further extension up to Q <lb/> 2  =  8.9 GeV <lb/> 2 required to detect the proton in the <lb/>large acceptance spectrometer of Hall C, equipped by a new double focal plane proton polarimeter and a dedicated large <lb/>area calorimeter for the electron. The efficiency of the polarimeter was improved by using two thick CH 2 analyzers, each <lb/>followed by a pair of large-acceptance drift chambers which reconstructed the tracks of protons [67]. Finally, the data were <lb/>reconsidered in Ref. [68] by treating the pion background in a consistent way. <lb/>Definitely, the ratio G E  /G  M  measured by the polarization method shows a monotone decreasing when Q <lb/> 2 increases. An <lb/>extrapolation of this tendency at large Q <lb/> 2 may lead to a vanishing and even to a negative ratio. Assuming that the magnetic <lb/>FF is known from the unpolarized cross section, it has for consequence that the electric FF of the proton may vanish and <lb/>even be negative for some Q <lb/> 2 values. <lb/>Note that a measurement with longitudinally polarized beam on a transversally polarized target gives an asymmetry <lb/>which differs only by a sign from the proton polarization in the scattering on unpolarized target. Such measurement has <lb/>been performed at Q <lb/> 2  =  1.51 GeV <lb/> 2 [69]. <lb/>Polarization measurements are important also at low momentum transfer [70]. The possibility to extract FFs with <lb/>improved precision is relevant for different reasons: constrain nucleon models, reduce the error on the determination of <lb/>strange and axial FF, and get a better determination of the proton radius. <lb/> 4.1.3. Discussion <lb/> The Q <lb/> 2 dependence of the world data on proton FFs are shown in Figs. 7–9. At first sight, all the Rosenbluth data on <lb/> G E  and G M  show a behavior compatible with dipole behavior of FFs (ratio  µ  p G E  /G  M  ≃  1), whereas the data based on the <lb/>Akhiezer–Rekalo method show a deviation which is larger as the momentum transfer increases. Both methods rely on the <lb/>same reaction mechanism (one-photon exchange) and no experimental bias has been found in the measurement procedure. <lb/>However, if we consider selected unpolarized data, we note a perfect agreement with polarization data from Refs. <lb/>[67,68,65], Fig. 9). In order to understand what is the peculiarity of this set of data, compared to similar experiments done at <lb/>that time, we notice that radiative corrections are in general small. Let us stress that radiative corrections change not only <lb/>the absolute value of the cross section, but also its dependence on the relevant kinematical variables Q <lb/> 2 and  ϵ,  in particular <lb/>the slope of reduced cross section which is directly related to G E  [71]. This issue will be further discussed in Section 6. <lb/>Comparing to Ref. [47], we can observe that the published values of the cross section are in relative good agreement. G E <lb/> and G M  are sensitive not only to radiative corrections, but also to an overall normalization factor. A global error of a few <lb/>percent is usually added to the data, and includes different sources of systematics, as the beam intensity, position and energy <lb/>normalization, the uncertainty in the absolute measurement of the angles, the accuracy on event selection and uncertainty <lb/></body>

Data in time-like region <lb/> The individual determination of the FFs in the TL region has not yet been done due to the limitation in the intensity of <lb/>antiproton beams which did not allow a precise measurement of the angular distribution of the outgoing leptons, and of the <lb/>luminosity of e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  colliders. The results, obtained by the integration of the cross section, usually in a limited angular range, <lb/>are given in terms of a generalized FF derived under specific assumptions. <lb/>In 1955, antiprotons were produced and identified at the Berkeley Bevatron, by Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain [73], <lb/>who received the Nobel prize for physics in 1959. The first experiments with antiproton beams at Brookhaven [74] and <lb/>CERN [75] investigated mostly the annihilation on protons and neutrons at rest, detecting the reaction products in hydrogen <lb/>and deuterium filled bubble chambers. Compared to the electron–positron annihilation at rest, where only  γ  rays can <lb/>be produced, the available energy in  ¯ <lb/> NN leads to a variety of multi-mesons, as well as lepton pairs, to populate the final <lb/>states. The first ideas about lepton colliders were developed and concretized in the first successful e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  collision at ADA, in <lb/>Frascati [76]. The first measurement of the proton TL FFs was carried out at ADONE, in the e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> pp channel, where the <lb/>accumulated data, 25 events, corresponding to 0.2 pb <lb/> −1  integrated luminosity at q <lb/> 2  =  4.4 GeV <lb/> 2 allowed the measurement <lb/>of this cross section for the first time [77]. <lb/>TL FFs at threshold were then measured at CERN, on the basis of 34 events in the antiproton annihilation at rest in a liquid <lb/>H2 target [78]. A successful program was carried on at the Orsay DCI e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  Storage Ring, by the DM1 [79] (63 events in four <lb/> q <lb/> 2 values) and DM2 collaborations [80]. With a total of 112 events in six q <lb/> 2 values, the first attempt to measure the angular <lb/>distribution of the lepton and to test the validity of the  |G  E  | = |G  M  |  assumption was done. The statistic was too low, in order <lb/>to reach definite conclusions. <lb/>Advances in FFs measurements were obtained with the cooled antiproton beam of the Low-Energy Antiproton Ring <lb/>(LEAR), constructed in 1982 at CERN. Antiprotons were produced by focusing 23 GeV incident proton beams from the CERN <lb/>Proton Synchrotron (PS) on a nuclear (Be) target. By means of stochastic cooling, the LEAR facility provided antiproton beams <lb/>in the momentum range from 105 MeV to 2 GeV, with low emittance and momentum spread of  δp/p ∼  0.1% [8]. The LEAR <lb/>antiproton storage ring was operated until 1996, providing an intensive experimental study of low and medium energy <lb/>antiproton annihilations. The PS170 collaboration did the first high-statistics measurement of the TL FFs with a total of 3667 <lb/>collected events for 9 data points [8], allowing a temptative separation of G E  and G M  . <lb/>The angular distribution was found compatible with  |G  E  | = |G  M  |.  Moreover the data confirmed the indication of a steep <lb/>rise of the cross section near threshold, with a plateau  ≃  200 MeV wide, before a decrease as  ∝  q <lb/> −4  . <lb/>The highest energy (0.980 TeV) and intensity (L  =  10 <lb/> 30 cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  ) antiproton source was at Fermilab. The main use <lb/>of the source was to provide 100% luminosity for the Tevatron, however experiments as E760 [81] and E835 [7,82], have <lb/>performed measurements of FFs at high q <lb/> 2 . This was especially difficult because the interesting cross sections become very <lb/>small, with an increasing background. <lb/>The FENICE experiment at ADONE, primarily devoted to the measurement of the neutron FF [83], measured also the <lb/>proton magnetic FF, with 69 events for four q <lb/> 2 values [84]. <lb/></body>

Recently high statistic data taken with the CLEO detector for <lb/>TL momentum transfers of q <lb/> 2  =  14.2 and 17.4 GeV <lb/> 2 have been analyzed [86]. The data suggest that proton FFs scales as <lb/> G M  ≈  q <lb/> −2  , in contrast with quark counting scaling which predicts a q <lb/> −4  behavior. <lb/>A measurement of the proton TL FF has been reported by BES for nine q <lb/> 2 values for <lb/> √ <lb/> s in the range 2–3.07 GeV [87]. At <lb/>BES III new precise data are expected in next future in the near threshold region, for proton, neutron and other baryons. <lb/>In TL region, the quantity usually measured is the so-called effective FF G  eff , whose squared value is a combination of the <lb/>squared moduli of the electric and magnetic FFs, i.e. <lb/> G  eff  = <lb/>  <lb/> |G  E  |  2  +  2τ  |G  M  |  2 <lb/> 1  +  2τ <lb/> . <lb/> (81) <lb/>This definition follows from the assumption  |G  E  | = |G  M  | ≡  G  eff in the total cross section of Eq.

The recent data from the BaBar Collaboration [88] using initial state radiation, e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → <lb/> p  +  p  + γ  , suggest the presence of several structures. <lb/>The modulus of ratio R  =  G E  /G  M  has been determined from a fit of the differential cross section, by PS170 at LEAR [8], <lb/>and by the BaBar Collaboration [88]. The two sets of data, shown in Fig. 11, do not show a consistent trend, although the <lb/>errors are quite large. The results from BaBar suggest a ratio larger than one, in a wide region above threshold, whereas <lb/>data from Ref. [8] seem to indicate a scaling behavior  |G  E  | ≃ |G  M  |,  even though in smaller q <lb/> 2 range, close to the threshold. <lb/>Model prescriptions give very different indications for this ratio, which, however are all converging to  |R| =  1 at large q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The results from the PANDA experiment at FAIR are expected to clarify this issue [89,90]. <lb/> 4.2.1.

The cancellation of the phase-space  β  factor, induces a not vanishing cross section <lb/>just above threshold. <lb/>The main features of the enhancement factor in case of production of a fermion pair f f is that the velocity  β  in the <lb/>denominator cancels the phase-space  β  factor, so that at threshold a step is expected in the cross section, whose value is: <lb/> σ (e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  f f  )(4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> α <lb/> 3 <lb/> 2M 2  . <lb/> However, due to the resummation factor, this cancellation disappears after few MeV and the cross section rises again as <lb/>expected according to the opening of the phase space. Actually, due to the finite CMS energy resolution, it is not simple to <lb/>detect this step. The connection with the data is discussed in Section 6. <lb/>In the case of e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  annihilation into a boson pair no step is expected, since the boson pair is produced in a P wave, whose <lb/>wave function vanishes at the origin and furthermore a  β <lb/> 2 factor is present in the cross section at the origin. <lb/>The situation in the case of a charged baryon pair is rather different. The analyticity of F  1 and F  2 requires also the <lb/>contribution of S-wave only and G E  =  G M  at threshold. Let us consider first the proton–antiproton case. To measure the <lb/>cross section exactly at threshold in an electron–positron symmetric collider is in practice impossible, since the outgoing <lb/>particles, produced at rest in the laboratory, do not reach the detector. In the case of pp  →  e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  , stopping the antiproton <lb/>into the proton target to reach the threshold, one has to deal with corrections due to the straggling into the target, the <lb/>formation of atomic states and a certain number of complications. The best way to avoid all these problems is by means of <lb/>an asymmetric electron–positron collider and measuring cross sections via initial state radiation technique. In this way the <lb/>threshold can be reached with full efficiency and it turns out that the total CMS energy is obtained with very good resolution, <lb/>comparable to what is obtained in a symmetric collider, that is  ∼1  MeV. <lb/>Presently, the most precise data are the ones achieved by BaBar [95], see Fig. 10. The main features of these data are: <lb/>a clear step at threshold (i.e. a steep decreasing of the effective FF, G  eff  ∝ β <lb/> −1  ) followed by a rather flat cross section in a <lb/> ∼200  MeV energy range. Extrapolating this flat cross section up to the threshold and applying the enhancement factor, it is <lb/>found that <lb/> σ (e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  pp)(4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = (0.85  nb)  |G(4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> (84) <lb/>where G(4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  )  is the common value of the electric and magnetic FF at threshold. The identity of Eq. (84), compared to <lb/>the data, implies the rather peculiar result that  |G <lb/> p <lb/> (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  )| = |G <lb/> p <lb/>E  (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  )| = |G <lb/> p <lb/>M  (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  )| =  1.00  ±  0.05, like in the case <lb/>of a pointlike fermion [34]. Actually in the most recent BaBar data [95] the very first 2 MeV bin is not consistent with <lb/>the extrapolation and the aforementioned conclusion about the FF at threshold. More data are needed to settle this point. <lb/>However, applying also the pointlike fermion pair resummation factor, the flat behavior of the cross section above threshold <lb/>can be achieved only if the FF has exactly the opposite behavior of the resummation factor. Assuming that this is not the <lb/>case, the consequence is that the pointlike resummation factor should not be applied in the case of a hadron pair, which is <lb/></body>

			<body> reasonable. By the same token a clear step, as the one that is observed, is an indication that there is no pointlike resummation <lb/>factor itself. The enhancement factor takes into account the one photon exchange diagram, which implies a divergence, <lb/>canceled by the phase space factor, while the resummation factor should take into account the exchange of many photons. <lb/>Gluon exchange should also be taken into account in the case of a baryon pair, suggesting that  α  S  instead of  α  should be <lb/>included in the resummation factor. Doing that and assuming  α  S  ∼  0.5 a flat cross section in the  ∼200  MeV range is obtained <lb/>in agreement with BaBar data. <lb/>Charged hyperon pairs, as well as  Λ  c  pair cross section at the relative thresholds should help in understanding Coulomb <lb/>interaction in the case of charged baryon pairs. <lb/>In the case of neutral baryon pair no Coulomb correction is expected. The usual assumption is that hadron formation <lb/>concerns short range and short times, while Coulomb interaction acts at long range and times, when the hadron is already <lb/>created. Any evidence of a step, in the case of neutral baryons, should be due to Coulomb interaction at the quark level [34]. <lb/>Present data about neutral baryon pairs are not enough accurate to give an answer to this question. <lb/> 5. Hadron structure theory <lb/> In this section we report about theories or models which describe the dynamical properties of hadrons, focusing on the <lb/>ones which apply in both SL and TL region. <lb/>In Ref. [11] a study of the classes of models which can be analytically continued in the TL region, together with a global fit <lb/>to the available SL and TL data was performed, with particular attention to Vector Meson Dominance models (VMD). VMD <lb/>are based on the idea that a photon interacts with the nucleon through a vector meson (or an excited vector meson) with the <lb/>same quantum numbers. The number of contributing resonances can be extended, as in the VMD based on analyticity and <lb/>unitarity, which has been developed during the years (see Ref. [96] and references therein). The success of this approach <lb/>is due to the fact that a limited number of parameters with physical meaning as masses and coupling constants allow to <lb/>reproduce the data, even at large Q <lb/> 2 values. pQCD gives predictions on the asymptotic behavior of FFs, but the kinematical <lb/>region of applicability has to be defined in comparison with the experiments. Chiral Perturbation Theory (χ PT) has brought <lb/>deep insight on the nucleon structure, in particular at low Q <lb/> 2 . The first attempts to apply soliton models and Conformal <lb/>Field Theories (CFT) seem very promising. A phenomenological picture describing the meaning of FFs in an unified view of <lb/>scattering and annihilation reactions concludes this section. <lb/>Many other phenomenological concepts have been developed during the recent years and applied to FF data, trying in <lb/>particular to reproduce the decrease of the FF ratio: cloudy bag and diquark [97], quark–hadron duality [98], generalized <lb/>parton distributions [99,100]. We are aware that this list of recent papers is not exhaustive. As we stressed, our choice was <lb/>to select those models which may be applied in all the kinematical domain, both in scattering and annihilation regions. <lb/> 5.1. Vector meson dominance <lb/> The electromagnetic interaction of hadrons, at low energy, is unexpectedly well described by the vector meson <lb/>dominance (VMD) model. In such a model the interaction is mediated by vector mesons that couple directly to the photon. <lb/>This is of course an &apos;&apos;effective description&apos;&apos; of QCD since quark and gluon dynamics is not explicitly considered. However, <lb/>the success of VMD can be understood in terms of the large-N  c  approach [101] (being N c  the number of colors, so that the <lb/>underlying gauge group is SU(N  c  )). Indeed, in such a limit of QCD, the hadronic FFs are given as sums of simple poles in q <lb/> 2 , <lb/>representing intermediate resonances, that are stable when N c  → ∞.  In the same limit the number of poles to be considered <lb/>for a given FF diverges but the series is always convergent. In particular the two-point correlator of a current J(x) in large-N  c <lb/> limit or, in other words, in the lowest order in 1/N  c  , contains only meson states and it is <lb/> Π  JJ  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = ⟨J(q)J(−q)⟩ = − <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> d <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> q  2  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> , <lb/> (85) <lb/>where m j  is the mass of the jth meson and d j  is the matrix element for its decay into the vacuum <lb/> d j  = ⟨0|J(0)|j⟩. <lb/> Asymptotic freedom requires a logarithmic behavior, for large q <lb/> 2 , of the two-point function defined in Eq. (85) and this <lb/>implies that the sum must have an infinite number of terms. On the other hand, the constraints from short-distance QCD, <lb/>namely the power law behavior of the FFs [35,36], can be fulfilled by considering a finite number of states. <lb/> 5.1.1. Field–current identity <lb/> The primordial formulation of VMD (for a complete review see for instance Ref. [102]) is due to Sakurai [103]. He <lb/>introduced a vector meson interaction in the framework of gauge theories with non-Abelian symmetry, by requiring <lb/>invariance under local isospin rotation. In a phenomenological picture of VMD the interaction of a photon with hadrons is <lb/>mediated by vector mesons carrying the same quantum number as the photon, i.e., J <lb/> PC  =  1 <lb/> −−  . The coupling with these <lb/>particles can be interpreted as the hadronic contribution to the photon polarization, that enters as propagating vector <lb/></body>

			<body> mesons, instead of the quark–antiquark polarization process. The two possible representations are sketched by the Feynman <lb/>diagrams of Fig. 12, where, for the VMD case, only the  ρ  vector meson is considered. The description of the hadronic <lb/>polarization for the photon, in terms of its conversion into vector mesons, is a consequence of the so-called current–field <lb/>identity, proposed by Sakurai [103]. Under this hypothesis, the operator, J <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  (x),  of the hadronic electromagnetic current can <lb/>be identified with the vector meson field. In particular for the neutral  ρ  meson (isospin I  3  =  0), with mass m  ρ  and coupling <lb/>constant g  ρ  , the identity reads <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  (x) = <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  (x), <lb/> (86) <lb/>where  ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  (x)  is the third component of the SU(2)-isovector field  ⃗ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ  . The current–field identity, generalized to all the <lb/>components, implies the Proca condition <lb/> ∂ µ  ⃗ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ  =  0, <lb/>and hence, the massive vector field that couples with a conserved current is divergenceless. The first complete realization <lb/>of VMD in Lagrangian language is due to Kroll, Lee and Zumino [104]. The full Lagrangian contains the electromagnetic field, <lb/>the non-Abelian, intermediate vector meson field, called  ⃗ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ  , and the hadronic matter field, that describes the final hadrons. <lb/>For instance, in case of production of a nucleon–antinucleon pair, the hadronic matter is described by the usual Dirac field. <lb/>The pieces of the Lagrangian that are directly involved in the definition of the VMD model, assuming NN as hadronic final <lb/>state, are <lb/> L  I  = − <lb/> e <lb/> 2g  ρ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µν <lb/> 3  F  µν  −  g  ρNN ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  J  µ  −  e A <lb/> µ  J  µ  =  L <lb/> γ ρ <lb/> I <lb/> +  L <lb/> ρNN  +  L <lb/> γ  NN <lb/> I <lb/> , <lb/> (87) <lb/>where the subscript &apos;&apos;I&apos;&apos; refers to the so-called first representation of VMD (VMD I ), and,  ρ <lb/> µν <lb/> 3 and F <lb/> µν  are the electromagnetic <lb/>tensors of the neutral  ρ  meson field,  ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3 , and the photon field A <lb/> µ  , respectively. The three interaction Lagrangians given in <lb/>Eq. (87) describe: <lb/> •  the  γ  –ρ conversion, also sketched in the right panel of Fig. 12, with a coupling which vanishes at q <lb/> 2  =  0; <lb/> •  the subsequent decay  ρ →  NN, with coupling constant g  ρNN  ; <lb/> •  the direct electromagnetic and pointlike coupling  γ −  NN. <lb/> It follows that the Feynman amplitude for the process  γ →  NN, assuming nucleons of electric charge  |e|  and spin zero to <lb/>have only one FF G(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  is <lb/> M <lb/> µ  = ⟨NN|  e  ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  |0⟩ =  e  (p <lb/> ′ −  p) <lb/> µ  G(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> (88) <lb/>where p, p <lb/> ′  and q  =  p  +  p <lb/> ′  are the nucleon, antinucleon and photon four-momenta, and where the &apos;&apos;tilde&apos;&apos; stands for the <lb/>Fourier transform. To compute the FF in this Lagrangian approach, we need to know the electromagnetic current operator, <lb/> ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> EM , in the momentum space. Such an operator can be identified with the four-vector that multiplies the photon field A  µ  in <lb/>the interaction Lagrangian. By transforming the Lagrangian of Eq. (87) in the momentum space as <lb/> L  I  = − <lb/> e <lb/> 2g  ρ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µν <lb/> 3  F  µν  −  e J <lb/> µ  A  µ  −  g  ρNN ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  J  µ  −→ −e <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  + ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/>  <lb/> A  µ  −  g  ρNN  <lb/> µ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/> J  µ , <lb/> where we have used <lb/> − <lb/> e <lb/> 2g  ρ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µν <lb/> 3  F  µν  −→ − <lb/> e q <lb/> 2 <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/> A  µ , <lb/> we obtain the electromagnetic current operator <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  = <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  + ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> . <lb/> (89) <lb/>Furthermore, also the  <lb/> µ <lb/> 3 field can be expressed in terms of the hadronic current  <lb/> µ  by means of its equation of motion in <lb/>the momentum space <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ <lb/>  <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  = −g  ρNN  <lb/> µ  −→ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  = − <lb/> g  ρNN <lb/> µ <lb/> q  2  −  m  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> −→ <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  = <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> g  ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2  −  m  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> +  1 <lb/>  <lb/> ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> . <lb/> (90) <lb/>Finally, by using this expression of the  <lb/> µ <lb/> EM and the pointlike value  ⟨NN| <lb/> µ  |0⟩ = (p <lb/> ′ −  p) <lb/> µ  , the Feynman amplitude for <lb/> γ →  NN, computed in the VMD I model, reads <lb/> M <lb/> µ <lb/> I  =  e  ⟨NN| <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  |0⟩ =  e  ⟨NN| <lb/> µ  |0⟩ <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> g  ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2  −  m  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> +  1 <lb/>  <lb/> =  e  (p <lb/> ′ −  p) <lb/> µ <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> g  ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2  −  m  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> +  1 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (91) <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 12. QCD contribution to the photon vacuum polarization in terms of quark–antiquark loop, in the left panel, and through the coupling to vector <lb/>mesons in the right panel, in the VMD model. <lb/> Fig. 13. The two diagrams that contribute to the FF G  I  (q <lb/> 2  )  of Eq. (92), obtained in the framework of VMD I . <lb/> By comparing this result with the expression of the amplitude given in Eq. (88) we obtain the FF <lb/> G  I  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = − <lb/> g  ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2  −  m  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> +  1, <lb/>(92) <lb/>where, as usual, the subscript &apos;&apos;I&apos;&apos; stands for VMD I model. The outlined procedure allows to achieve a relation between the <lb/>electromagnetic current and the vector meson field, given in Eq. (89). It differs from the Sakurai&apos;s current–field identity of <lb/>Eq. (86), first because the photon–vector meson coupling is proportional to q <lb/> 2 and so it vanishes at zero momentum transfer <lb/>and second because it contains also the hadronic current  <lb/> µ  . As a consequence, the photon couples to the NN final state, not <lb/>only through intermediate vector mesons, but also directly, by means of a pointlike  γ  NN interaction. The Feynman diagrams <lb/>depicting these contributions are shown in Fig. 13. <lb/>Besides this first representation of VMD, Sakurai constructed an alternative realization, which is indeed called second <lb/>representation of VMD (VMD II ), inspired to the current–field identity of Eq. (86). In this case the Lagrangian, that describes <lb/>the interactions among the photon, the intermediate vector meson and the hadronic final state, corresponding to the one in <lb/>Eq. (87), is <lb/> L <lb/> VMD <lb/>II <lb/> = − <lb/> e m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  A  µ  −  g  ρNN ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  J  µ  =  L <lb/> γ ρ <lb/> II  +  L <lb/> ρNN <lb/> . <lb/> (93) <lb/>The  γ  –ρ coupling, i.e. the mass-mixing term  L <lb/> γ ρ <lb/> II , defined to reproduce Eq. (86), introduces a non-physical finite mass, <lb/>proportional to m  ρ  , in the dressed photon propagator. In order to correct for this, a photon mass counter-term in the <lb/>full Lagrangian is needed [102]. The electromagnetic current operator, extracted from the  L <lb/> γ ρ <lb/> II interaction Lagrangian, is <lb/>proportional to the  ρ  field and coincides with the one obtained from the Sakurai&apos;s current–field identity of Eq. (86), in fact, <lb/>in the momentum space, it is <lb/> µ <lb/> EM  = <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> ˜ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ <lb/> 3  . <lb/> (94) <lb/>Using this result and the expression of the  <lb/> µ <lb/> 3 field given in Eq. (90), we can compute the FF, G  II  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  in the framework of <lb/>VMD II model, by means of the same procedure of Eq. (91).

In <lb/>fact the VMD I and VMD II FFs, given in Eqs. (92) and (95), respectively, fulfill the conditions <lb/> G  I  (0) =  1, G  II  (0) = <lb/> g  ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> . <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 14. The diagram that contributes to the FF G  II  (q <lb/> 2  )  of Eq. (95), obtained in the framework of VMD II . <lb/> These values can be interpreted as the fractions of the electric charge of the nucleon (assumed equal to  |e|),  that the photon <lb/>sees, directly, in case of VMD I , or through the vector meson  ρ,  in case of VMD II . Electric charge conservation requires a <lb/>normalization to unity. Only in VMD I model, such a condition is automatically fulfilled, while, in VMD II it must be imposed <lb/>setting g  ρ  =  g  ρNN  . <lb/>Moreover, assuming a complete  ρ  dominance, this identity should be valid for all hadronic final states, as for instance: <lb/> π <lb/> + <lb/> π <lb/> −  , K <lb/> +  K <lb/> −  , . . . , and then, the corresponding coupling constants should coincide, g  ρNN  =  g  ρπ π  =  g  ρKK  = · · · =  g  ρ  . In <lb/>other words, if we consider only one intermediate meson, it must couple with the same intensity to the photon and to all <lb/>the hadronic final states. This summarizes the universality condition, introduced by Sakurai. <lb/>The less constrained VMD II model is also the most used representation of VMD. Indeed, the universality condition, that <lb/>makes the two representations equivalent, is often exploited as a further constraint to the additional free parameters usually <lb/>introduced in many phenomenological parametrizations of hadronic FFs. <lb/>The FF expressions of Eqs. (92) and (95) can be generalized to the case of multiple vector meson contribution by <lb/>considering, for VMD I and VMD II , respectively, the electromagnetic currents <lb/> µ <lb/> EM−I  = <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> g j <lb/> ˜ <lb/> φ <lb/> µ <lb/> j  + ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> , <lb/> ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> µ <lb/> EM−II  = <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> g j <lb/> ˜ <lb/> φ <lb/> µ <lb/> j  , <lb/> as superposition of vector meson fields  <lb/> µ <lb/> j <lb/> G  I  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = − <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> +  1, <lb/> G  II  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = − <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> q  2  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> . <lb/> (96) <lb/>In this case the universality condition that makes the two descriptions equivalent and ensures the normalization G  II  (0) =  1, <lb/>is <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> =  1. <lb/>(97) <lb/>Moreover, in case of VMD II , the two-point correlator function of Eq. (85), having d j  =  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  /g  j  , can be written as <lb/> Π  JJ  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = − <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/>  <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> g j <lb/>   2 <lb/> 1 <lb/> q  2  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> . <lb/> A further interesting difference between these two ideas of VMD concerns the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding <lb/>FFs, given in Eq. (95). In fact, in the limit  |q <lb/> 2  | → ∞,  i.e., SL or TL, <lb/> G  I  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ − <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> +  1, <lb/> G  II  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ − <lb/> 1 <lb/> q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  , <lb/> and hence, without any constraint on the coupling constants, G  I  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  goes to a constant, while G  II  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  vanishes as 1/q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>However, dimensional counting rule and pQCD predict that, at sufficiently high momentum transfer, FFs should scale as <lb/>negative powers of q <lb/> 2 and thus they should vanish. It follows that, aiming to have FFs able to reproduce also high-q <lb/> 2 <lb/> behaviors, the universality condition of Eq. (97) must be required in the framework of VMD II as well. In other words: <lb/>VMD I ensures the unitary normalization at q <lb/> 2  =  0, but not the asymptotic behavior which depends on the coupling <lb/>constants, while VMD II gives automatically the expected vanishing behavior at high q <lb/> 2 , but the normalization at q <lb/> 2  =  0 turns <lb/>out to be dependent on the coupling constants. Hence, in any case, the universality condition appears to be an unavoidable <lb/>constraint, that, making the two descriptions equivalent, provides FFs well behaving at low and high momentum <lb/>transfer. <lb/> 5 <lb/></body>

On the other hand, the 1/N  c  corrections <lb/>move the pole away from the real axis, generating a non-vanishing imaginary part for m <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 and hence a physical width that <lb/>makes the vector meson unstable, by allowing it to decay. The 1/N  c  -corrected propagator can be written as <lb/> D(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = − <lb/> 1 <lb/> q  2  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  −  Π(q  2  ) <lb/>, <lb/> where the complex function  Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is the scalar part of the tensor correlator [105]. By means of the optical theorem, or the <lb/>so-called Cutkosky&apos;s rule [106,107], the imaginary part of  Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  can be expressed in terms of the decay channels of the <lb/>meson, as <lb/>Im[Π  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )] = − <lb/>  <lb/> {α} <lb/> Γ α  P  α (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) θ (q <lb/> 2  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> α ), <lb/> (98) <lb/>where  Γ α  ,  P  α (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and q <lb/> 2 <lb/> α  are the partial width, the phase space and the squared mass of a decay channel of the set  {α}.  Using <lb/>the DR of Eq. (62), also the real part can be computed under the same hypothesis, i.e., assuming the intermediate channels <lb/> {α}.  The new pole position, q <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  , which is obtained as the solution of the implicit equation <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  −  m <lb/> 0 <lb/> j <lb/> 2  −  Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  ) =  0, <lb/>has a non-vanishing imaginary part as a consequence of the complex structure of  Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ).  The real part of q <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  represents the <lb/>dressed resonance mass, that can be approximated as m <lb/> 2  ≃  m <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  +Re[Π(m <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  )].  Thus, the dressed propagator can be written as <lb/> D(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ≃ − <lb/> 1 <lb/> q  2  −  m  2  +  i m  Γ (q  2  ) <lb/>, <lb/> where the energy-dependent width is:  Γ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = −Im[Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )]/m. <lb/> Unfortunately, the correlator function  Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  of a given vector meson cannot be computed exactly, due to the lack of <lb/>experimental data needed. In fact, the series of all the possible (infinite) decay channels  α,  that defines the imaginary part <lb/>of  Π(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  given in Eq. (98), depends on an infinite number of partial widths that are unknown. It follows that only estimates <lb/>are possible. For instance, in the case of the  ρ  meson, the correlator is usually computed considering the unique  π <lb/> + <lb/> π <lb/> −  decay <lb/>channel. <lb/> 5.1.3. The Massam–Zichichi model <lb/> The Massam–Zichichi model [108] (MZm) conceived in 1966 is the first VMD-based parametrization of the nucleon FFs <lb/>which pursues the goal of describing SL as well as TL data. It represents a prototype for all the subsequent attempts. Indeed <lb/>it defines the main ingredients of a VMD approach to the nucleon FFs. The first one concerns the idea to use, instead of <lb/>the proton and neutron FFs, their isospin components so that to distinguish the contributions due to I  =  0 (isoscalar) and <lb/> I  =  1 (isovector) vector mesons. However, from the experimental point of view, this decomposition requires a greater effort, <lb/>because the knowledge of both neutron and proton FFs, in the same energy regions, is needed. <lb/>By considering the three lightest vector mesons:  ρ, ω  and  φ,  and using the second realization of VMD, in particular the <lb/>second expression of Eq. (96), Massam and Zichichi parametrized the four Dirac and Pauli, isovector and isoscalar FFs, as <lb/> F <lb/> V <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> 1 <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ρ  −  q  2  , <lb/> F <lb/> S <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ω <lb/> g  ω <lb/> g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> 1 <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ω  −  q  2  + <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ <lb/> g  φ <lb/> g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> φNN <lb/> 1 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ  −  q  2  , <lb/> (99) <lb/>where m  α  , g  α  , and g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN  are the mass, the electromagnetic coupling to the photon and, the vector (Dirac) and tensor <lb/>(Pauli) coupling to NN, for the vector meson  α  (α  = ρ, ω, φ).  The Feynman diagrams of the processes underlying the <lb/>FF parametrizations of Eq. (99) are shown in Fig. 15. <lb/>There are nine parameters, only six are free, indeed for each of the three vector mesons, the electromagnetic, g  α  , and two <lb/>hadronic couplings, g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN  , appear always in the form g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN /g α  . The number of free parameters is firstly reduced to four, by <lb/>assuming SU(3) flavor symmetry and furthermore, by requiring the normalizations to charge and magnetic moment (four <lb/>conditions), all these parameters are fixed. <lb/>Another important ingredient of such parametrization is the introduction of non-pointlike electromagnetic and hadronic <lb/>interactions. Under this hypothesis, the couplings g  α  and g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN  are described by the q <lb/> 2 -dependent functions and so they are <lb/>written as <lb/>1 <lb/> g  α <lb/> → <lb/> 1 <lb/> G  α (q  2  ) <lb/> = <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  α <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  −  q  2  /Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/>EM <lb/> , <lb/> g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN  →  G <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  g <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> αNN <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  −  q  2  /Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/>h <lb/> , <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 15. Feynman diagram of the nucleon FFs in terms of the VMD I contributions of the isovector meson  ρ  and the isoscalar mesons  ω  and  φ. <lb/> where the deviation from the pointlike interaction is described by typical monopole structures, depending on the <lb/>electromagnetic and hadronic cut-offs,  Λ  EM and  Λ  h , which define the &apos;&apos;size&apos;&apos; of the particles, as &apos;&apos;seen&apos;&apos; by the corresponding <lb/>interaction. In particular,  Λ  EM,h  = ∞  means pointlike electromagnetic or hadronic interaction. <lb/>It is important to notice that finite values for both these cut-offs, that are the only free parameters of the MZm, would <lb/>imply the same asymptotic behavior for all FFs: F <lb/> V  ,S <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2    −3  as  |q <lb/> 2  | → ∞.  Such a behavior is in agreement with the <lb/>power law scaling, predicted by dimensional counting rules and pQCD [36,35], only in case of the Pauli FFs, while, in case <lb/>of Dirac FFs we would expect F <lb/> V  ,S <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2    −2 <lb/> pQCD <lb/> . On the other hand, setting one cut-off,  Λ  EM or  Λ  h , to infinity does not <lb/>help because both, Dirac and Pauli FFs, will change asymptotic power law. <lb/>In Ref. [108] the authors decided to assume pointlike electromagnetic interaction, fixing  Λ  EM  = ∞,  and to fit the hadronic <lb/>cut-off  Λ  h to the data. Their result was quite unsatisfactory, in particular the MZm appeared unable to provide a good <lb/>description of the neutron data. Nevertheless, a very interesting result has been obtained for the unique free parameter  Λ  h , <lb/>in fact, its best value is turned out to be very close to the nucleon mass, i.e.:  Λ <lb/> best <lb/>h <lb/> = (980 ±  18) MeV. <lb/>Two weaknesses of the MZm have to be noticed. <lb/> •  The first concerns the asymptotic behavior that, as already discussed, independently on the values of the cut-offs, cannot <lb/>agree with the pQCD and dimensional counting rules prediction. <lb/> •  Secondly, even though FFs have well defined analytic expressions as functions of the squared momentum transfer and <lb/>hence, are easily extensible from the SL to the TL region, they do not possess the theoretically required analytic properties. <lb/>In fact, the poles are real and there are no imaginary parts in the TL region as it should be, as a consequence of the optical <lb/>theorem. <lb/>Nevertheless, the MZm is able to give a fair description of the data, despite being an essentially fully-determined model. <lb/>The only free parameter, the hadronic cut-off, turns out to have a quite &apos;&apos;natural&apos;&apos; value, i.e.:  Λ  h  ≃  m N  . <lb/>An interesting prediction of this model concerns the presence of a SL zero, at q <lb/> 2  ≃ −2.97  GeV <lb/> 2 (the position of the zero <lb/>is quite stable with respect to the only free parameter  Λ  h ), for the proton electric FF, G <lb/> p <lb/>E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  see Fig. 16. This fact was not <lb/>pointed out by the authors and it could be interpreted as an artifact of the FF parametrization. In fact, the proton electric FF <lb/>is obtained through the combination <lb/> G <lb/> p <lb/>E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F <lb/> S <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) +  F <lb/> V <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> n <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> S <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) +  F <lb/> V <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>  , <lb/> and hence, a zero and a consequent change of sign could be the result of a compensation of the various additive terms, at <lb/>moderately high values of  −q <lb/> 2 , in the SL region, where all the contributions are quite small. However, in retrospect, this <lb/>weird result anticipated qualitatively the behavior observed forty years later. <lb/> 5.1.4. The Iachello–Jackson–Landé model <lb/> In 1972 Iachello, Jackson and Landé [109] proposed a VMD-based model (IJLm) for a &apos;&apos;semi-phenomenological&apos;&apos; <lb/>description of nucleon FFs. This model has been further upgraded in Refs. [110–112] including a more accurate TL complex <lb/>structure. The main differences between the IJLm and the MZm concern: <lb/> •  the treatment of the  ρ  resonance, for which a finite width is considered; <lb/> •  the so-called intrinsic nucleon FF, i.e., the energy-dependent hadronic coupling introduced by Zichichi and Massam, is <lb/>here included in a different form; <lb/> •  the Dirac isovector and isoscalar FFs, that describe the vector part of the amplitude, contain also a direct photon–nucleon <lb/>coupling, as in the VMD I model (see the first FF definition in Eq. (96)). <lb/>The final expressions for the FFs in IJLm are <lb/> F <lb/> V <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> + <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> 1 <lb/> D  ρ (q  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> ,  F <lb/> S <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> g  ω <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ω  −  q  2  + <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> φNN <lb/> g  φ <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ  −  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> F <lb/> V <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> 1 <lb/> D  ρ (q  2  ) <lb/>, <lb/> F <lb/> S <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> g  ω <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ω <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ω  −  q  2  + <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> φNN <lb/> g  φ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ  −  q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (100) <lb/></body>

Feynman diagram of the nucleon FFs in terms of the VMD II contributions of the isovector meson  ρ  and the isoscalar mesons  ω  and  φ.  In the IJLm <lb/>the last diagram contributes only to the Dirac FFs. <lb/> The function g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is the intrinsic FF and we will discuss its features in the following. The  ρ  propagator, D <lb/> −1 <lb/> ρ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  is normal-<lb/>ized as D  ρ (0) =  1 and accounts for the finite width of the resonance. It has a non-vanishing imaginary part in the TL region: <lb/> D <lb/> −1 <lb/> ρ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ  +  8Γ  ρ  m  π /π <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ρ  −  q  2  + (4m  2 <lb/> π  −  q  2  )Γ ρ α(q  2  )/m π <lb/> , <lb/> (101) <lb/>with <lb/> α(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 2 <lb/> π <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  4m 2 <lb/> π <lb/> q  2 <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> π  −  q  2  + <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 <lb/> 2m  π <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (102) <lb/>The  ω  and  φ  contributions, since these resonances are very narrow, have been included as simple real poles, similarly to <lb/>MZm. The direct photon–nucleon coupling is represented by the &apos;&apos;1&apos;&apos; appearing in the parametrizations of the Dirac FFs, in <lb/>the first row of Eq. (100). The Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 17 summarize the VMD structure of this model. There is, in <lb/>addition to those of the MZm reported in Fig. 15, a diagram (the last one), that accounts for the direct coupling of the photon <lb/>to the NN state. <lb/>For the intrinsic FF, g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  the more reliable functional form by the phenomenological point of view, was considered the <lb/>dipole <lb/> g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − γ  e <lb/> iθ q <lb/> 2    −2  , <lb/> (103) <lb/>which, in the last version of the model [110,112], contains a complex free parameter and hence, two real degrees of freedom: <lb/>a modulus  γ  and a phase  θ  . Such a phase is non-vanishing and constant only for q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &gt;  0 and it has been introduced to account <lb/>for the complex structure of the FFs in the TL region, although it violates the Schwarz reflection principle. <lb/>This model has six free parameters: four coupling constants, plus the two parameters of the intrinsic FF g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ).  There are <lb/>more degrees of freedom than in the MZm case, for two reasons. First, because here the normalization conditions at q <lb/> 2  =  0 <lb/>provide only the constraints (two) for the Dirac FFs. In fact, as already stated, the Pauli FFs have been parametrized using <lb/>the VMD I form (first expression of Eq. (96)), which is automatically normalized, so that, the initial six coupling constants are <lb/>reduced to four. Secondly, no flavor SU(3) conditions have been used. <lb/></body>

			<body> The asymptotic behavior of FFs, thanks to this double-model parametrization (VMD I for Dirac FFs and VMD II for Pauli FFs), <lb/>is in agreement with theoretical predictions <lb/> 6 . Indeed, the Dirac FFs scale as g(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  that is: F <lb/> V  ,S <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> −2  as  |q <lb/> 2  | → ∞, <lb/> while the Pauli FFs have an additional power  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> −1  , due to their VMD II -based form, and hence: F <lb/> V  ,S <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∝ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> −3  as <lb/> |q <lb/> 2  | → ∞. <lb/> Moreover, the analytic structure of FFs as well, appears more reliable than the one of MZm. The  ρ  propagator and also <lb/>the intrinsic FF are conceived to reproduce the discontinuity cut in the q <lb/> 2 complex plane as required by the optical theorem. <lb/>Finally, also in this case the parametrization of G <lb/> p <lb/>E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  shows a trend similar to that of MZm, i.e., there is a SL zero, that <lb/>now is at a higher momentum transfer, around q <lb/> 2  ≃ −8  GeV <lb/> 2 . Fig. 18 shows the parametrizations obtained in Ref. [111] <lb/>for the FFs in SL and TL regions, in comparison with data and the Gari–Krümpelmann–Lomon model [113], described in the <lb/>next section. <lb/> 5.1.5. The Gari–Krümpelmann–Lomon model <lb/> Starting from 1984 Gari and Krümpelmann [134–136] developed a third version of VMD-based model for the nucleon <lb/>FFs. At a later stage, such model was improved by Lomon, who, firstly, introduced the contributions of excited vector mesons <lb/>[137–139] and then made the analytic continuation in TL region [113]. <lb/>These authors faced the issue of the description of the photon–nucleon interaction with the intent of making a synthesis <lb/>of the pictures of strong interaction: &apos;&apos;mesondynamics&apos;&apos;, at low momentum, and pQCD at high momentum. <lb/>Similarly to MZm and IJLm, see Sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.4, the Gari–Krümpelmann–Lomon model (GKLm) consists in a <lb/>parametrization of isospin components of the Dirac and Pauli FFs in terms of vector meson propagators, for the low-q <lb/> 2 <lb/> region, and an energy-dependent meson–nucleon coupling, that becomes effective at high q <lb/> 2 . The expressions given in <lb/>Ref. [136] are <lb/> F <lb/> V <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> 1 <lb/> D  ρ (q  2  ) <lb/> F <lb/> ρ <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> D <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> F <lb/> S <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> g  ω <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ω <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ω  −  q  2  F <lb/> ω <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> φNN <lb/> g  φ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ  −  q  2 <lb/> F <lb/> φ <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> g  ω <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> D <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> F <lb/> V <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/> 1 <lb/> D  ρ (q  2  ) <lb/> F <lb/> ρ <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρNN <lb/> g  ρ <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> D <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> F <lb/> S <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> g  ω <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ω <lb/> m  2 <lb/> ω  −  q  2  F <lb/> ω <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> φNN <lb/> g  φ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ  −  q  2 <lb/> F <lb/> φ <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> ωNN <lb/> g  ω <lb/> − <lb/> g <lb/> 1 <lb/> φNN <lb/> g  φ <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> D <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> where D <lb/> −1 <lb/> ρ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is the  ρ  propagator for which different forms have been used: a real pole, 1/(1  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ ),  by Gari and <lb/>Krümpelmann and a complex pole, with the theoretically expected analyticity, by Lomon. In any case, however, it is <lb/>normalized as D  ρ (0) =  1. The main differences with respect the previous formulations are the following. <lb/> •  Both Dirac and Pauli FFs are parametrized in the VMD I framework. <lb/> •  There are different kinds of intrinsic FFs. The functions F <lb/> ρ,ω,φ <lb/> 1,2 <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are the meson–nucleon coupling, while F <lb/> D <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  describe <lb/>the interaction of the photon directly with the non-resonant quark structure, and account for the asymptotic behavior. <lb/>They represent the high momentum transfer part of the amplitude. All these intrinsic FFs are parametrized as dipoles <lb/>(F <lb/> ρ,ω,φ,D <lb/> 1 <lb/> ) or tripoles (F <lb/> ρ,ω,φ,D <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), and depend on two cut-offs that characterize the low energy, i.e., VMD (few hundred of <lb/>MeV), scale and the pQCD scale (few GeV), where the power law behavior becomes effective. At q <lb/> 2  =  0 all the intrinsic <lb/>FFs, but F <lb/> φ <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  which is zero to avoid the OZI rule violating  φNN-coupling  in the vector part of the current, are normalized <lb/>to unity. A logarithmic QCD correction, in terms of the QCD scale  Λ  QCD is also included. <lb/> •  Only in its last version [113], by considering a  ρ  propagator with a suitable energy-dependent width (similarly to what <lb/>has been done in the case of IJLm, see Section 5.1.4), the GKLm has been provided with a more reliable analytic structure. <lb/>This allowed the extension of the description also in the TL region. <lb/>The GKLm, having a larger number of free parameters with respect to the MZm and IJLm, provides a very good description <lb/>of all the available data, i.e., those of proton and neutron, electric and magnetic FFs, in both SL and TL region (in the TL region <lb/>only data on total cross sections  σ (e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  pp) and  σ (e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  nn) have been considered). In this case, in contrary with <lb/>previous achievements, there is not a clear statement about the presence of a SL zero for the electric proton FF. In particular, <lb/></body>

Each set of data shown in these graphs represents the <lb/>world collection for the corresponding observables and may not coincide with the set used for fitting in the individual analyses. <lb/> in the last version of the GKLm [113], four different cases have been considered, depending on the choice between two <lb/>possible parametrizations of the  ρ  propagator, and including or not a set of proton TL data obtained with the initial state <lb/>radiation (ISR) technique.

Dispersion approaches to nucleon form factors <lb/> DRs described in Section 3.2.3, represent a powerful theoretical tool to handle FFs.

			<body> In light of that, analyses of FFs based on DRs, provide almost model-independent results and parametrizations that, <lb/>mainly due to the manifestly analytic treatment, are naturally valid in all kinematical regions and, in principle, in the whole <lb/>complex plane. <lb/>Two different kinds of DR approaches can be defined: the first, that we will call DR VMD , is based on VMD [140,141,13], <lb/>while the second, called DR pheno , has a purely descriptive character, is more model-independent and, besides the analyticity <lb/>requirements, it is essentially grounded on the data. <lb/> 5.2.1. Dispersive analyses of form factors based on VMD <lb/> The master formula for the DR VMD approach is the DR for the imaginary part given in Eq. (61). This is an integral repre-<lb/>sentation that allows to compute the FF at any q <lb/> 2 , knowing only its imaginary part along the (TL) discontinuity cut  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  , ∞). <lb/> In other words, as a consequence of the analyticity, the FF is univocally and entirely determined by the imaginary part along <lb/>the cut. <lb/>The main difficulty in using this procedure to construct a parametrization for the FFs which allows to extract from the <lb/>data as much as possible information about the nucleon structure, is represented by the limited experimental knowledge of <lb/>TL FFs. <lb/>Limitations are due, first, to the impossibility of measuring imaginary parts of individual FFs (only relative phases are <lb/>experimentally observable) and secondly to the fact that, contrary to what it is needed (the integration in the DR is performed <lb/>all over the infinite cut), not all TL q <lb/> 2 are experimentally accessible. Of particular interest is the so-called unphysical region, <lb/>i.e., the TL q <lb/> 2 -interval  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ,  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> N  ),  from the theoretical to the physical threshold, where FFs in principle are not accessible, <lb/>even though they are still well defined and receive, just in this region, the main contributions from intermediate states <lb/> 7 . <lb/>The problem of describing imaginary parts, the so-called spectral functions, at low-energy and also in the unphysical <lb/>region, can be solved using VMD (see Section 5.1), i.e., assuming that the coupling of the virtual photon with the NN final <lb/>state (considering for instance the production channel), is mediated by vector mesons. In particular, in the VMD II model, the <lb/>FFs, for which we use the symbol F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  are given by the second expression of Eq. (96) as the sum of real poles, or vector <lb/>meson propagators, weighted by the coupling constants g jNN m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  /g  j  , i.e., <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  −  q  2  . <lb/> Assuming this description for the SL FF, the spectral function, fulfilling the DR of Eq. (61): that is <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN <lb/> g j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  −  q  2  = <lb/> 1 <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> π <lb/> Im[F  (t)] <lb/> t  −  q  2  dt, q <lb/> 2  ≤  0 (SL region), <lb/>(104) <lb/>can be deduced, by noting that the kernel of the integral has the same monopole form of the propagators, and hence it can <lb/>be written as a sum of Dirac delta functions, on the pole positions, with the same set of coupling constants as coefficients, <lb/>Im[F  (t)] = π <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> g jNN m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> g j <lb/> δ(t −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  ). <lb/> (105) <lb/>Of course, in the limit of real pole approximation, i.e. considering, as we have done so far, intermediate vector mesons as <lb/>stable particles, the DR VMD approach does not differ at all by the pure VMD model. The analytic structure of FFs remains the <lb/>same, apart from a set of isolated points, the pole positions, where FFs acquire a non-vanishing delta-like imaginary part. <lb/>The cut  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞),  used in the DR, is only a fictitious discontinuity, in fact the integral of Eq. (104) would give the same <lb/>result if performed over infinitesimal neighborhoods of the poles m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j  . <lb/>The main advantage of this procedure lies in the possibility of introducing contributions of continua, resonances with <lb/>finite width and also constraints on the asymptotic behavior, directly in the spectral function [140,141,13,146]. Such a <lb/>spectral function is all what we need to define a parametrization for the FF, which is rigorously analytic and valid in any <lb/>kinematical region. <lb/>In particular, using the Cutkosky&apos;s rule [106,107] (see. Section 5.1.2, Eq. (98)), which is a consequence of unitarity <lb/>[147,148], and assuming time-reversal invariance, the imaginary part of the amplitude for the process e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  NN can <lb/>be decomposed as <lb/>Im[M(e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  NN)]  = <lb/>  <lb/> n <lb/>  <lb/> dΦ n  M <lb/>  * <lb/> (NN →  n)M(e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  n), <lb/> where the sum includes discrete quantum numbers and phase-space integrations for all the allowed, on-shell, intermediate <lb/>states of a complete set  {|n⟩}.  Such a decomposition, for the process e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − → <lb/>  <lb/> n  →  NN, is sketched in Fig. 19. The <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 19. Representation of Cutkosky&apos;s rule in case of nucleon FFs. <lb/> imaginary part of the amplitude  M(e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  NN) depends on the spectral functions of the nucleon FFs and hence the <lb/>intermediate states  |n⟩  can be considered as single contributions to the FFs. Each on-shell state  |j⟩  starts to contribute from <lb/>the threshold t j  = <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> k m <lb/> (j) <lb/> k <lb/>   2 <lb/> , which corresponds to the sum squared of the masses of all its particles. It follows that (see <lb/>Eq. (98)) <lb/>Im[F  (t)] = <lb/>  <lb/> j <lb/> A j  (t)θ (t −  t j  ) <lb/> where the function A j  (t)  accounts for the contribution of the state  |j⟩.  In case of a real pole of mass m j  , using Eq. (105), we <lb/>have <lb/> A j  (t) = π <lb/> g jNN m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> g j <lb/> δ <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/>  . <lb/> Finally, in the low-energy region, the spectral function can be written as a combination of two kinds of contributions: real <lb/>poles and extended structures. The former follows directly from VMD, where, to have more room for fitting, the VMD II model <lb/>is preferred. In case of extended structures, as continua and broad resonances, the parametrization has to accommodate <lb/>data of intermediate processes [13–16]. For instance, to account for the broad resonance  ρ(770)  and  π π  continuum, that <lb/>contribute to the isovector FFs, the L  =  1 partial wave amplitudes of the process NN  → π π  as well as the pion FF F  π (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> have been used. <lb/>Constraints on the asymptotic behavior of FFs from counting rules, or pQCD (see Section 5.3), can be imposed by requiring <lb/>the super-convergence relations defined in Section 3.2.4, as for instance those of Eq. (64). In particular, for the Dirac and Pauli <lb/>FFs, that vanish as t <lb/> −2  and t <lb/> −3  as  |t| → ∞,  respectively, the following three relations hold: <lb/>0  = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> π <lb/> Im[F 1  (t)]dt = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> π <lb/> Im[F 2  (t)]dt = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> π <lb/> t Im[F 2  (t)]dt. <lb/> (106) <lb/>Also in this case, having vector meson resonances as main contributions, the most convenient approach consists in <lb/>parameterizing the isospin components of Dirac and Pauli FFs. In Ref. [13], the spectral functions of these FFs were defined <lb/>as <lb/>Im <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> S <lb/>j  (t) <lb/>  <lb/> =  A <lb/> KK <lb/>j  (t) θ (t −  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> K  ) +  A <lb/> ρπ <lb/> j  (t) θ (t −  9m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ) + π <lb/>  <lb/> j=ω,φ,... <lb/> g jNN m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> g j <lb/> δ <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/>  θ (t −  t j  ) +  C <lb/> S <lb/>j  (t), <lb/> Im <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/> V <lb/>j  (t) <lb/>  <lb/> =  A <lb/> ππ <lb/> j  (t) θ (t −  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ) + π <lb/>  <lb/> j=ρ  ′  ,... <lb/> g jNN m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/> g j <lb/> δ <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> j <lb/>  θ (t −  t j  ) +  C <lb/> V <lb/>j  (t),  j  =  1, 2, <lb/>where A <lb/> α <lb/> j  (t)  describes the continuum due to the intermediate state  α,  A <lb/> π π <lb/> j  (t)  includes also the  ρ(770)  as a finite-width <lb/>resonance. The functions C <lb/> S,V <lb/>j <lb/> (t),  instead, rule the constraints from super-convergence relations as well as the pQCD <lb/>asymptotic behavior. Using such spectral functions and DRs, it is possible to construct a parametrization valid and well <lb/>defined in SL and TL regions and hence to obtain a simultaneous description of six sets of data, i.e., SL electric and magnetic <lb/>and TL effective FFs for both proton and neutron. While the masses of lightest vector mesons are fixed to the known values, <lb/>the widths, the coupling constants and the parameters that describe the asymptotic behavior are fitted to the data. They can <lb/>be considered the degrees of freedom of this parametrization. For instance in Ref. [13], depending on the number of vector <lb/>mesons and constraints on the asymptotic behavior, the number of free parameters varies from 14 to 22. Fig. 20 shows, in <lb/>comparison with data, the nucleon FFs obtained in the case of 14 free parameters. The data on the effective neutron FF have <lb/>not been used in the fit procedure, therefore the curves in the last graph represent a prediction. <lb/>The most recent update of this analysis [149], which includes the A1 data [58,59] for the proton SL FFs, is reported, as <lb/>thick gray lines, in the first four graphs of Fig. 20. In such refined analysis, a specific attention has been paid to the crucial <lb/>role played by analyticity and unitarity of FFs in the determination of proton and neutron radii (see also Section 3.2.7). In <lb/>particular, the electric proton charge radius computed in this, as well as other non-dispersive analyses, which, however, <lb/>require analytic descriptions in the whole kinematic region, see e.g. Ref. [150], turns out to be in agreement with the recent <lb/>result from muonic hydrogen measurements [151]. <lb/></body>

Investigations of space-like and time-like form factors through dispersion relations <lb/> The mathematical tools provided by DRs can be exploited to extract crucial information about nucleon FFs directly from <lb/>data, with a &apos;&apos;quasi model-independent&apos;&apos; procedure. In principle, having the possibility to measure a given FF, F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  in the <lb/>whole q <lb/> 2 SL region  (−∞,  0) and its imaginary part all over the TL cut  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞),  DR of Eq. (61) can be applied as a stringent <lb/>test for analyticity. However there are three practical obstacles that prevent this simple direct dispersive analysis. <lb/> •  The first limitation, as already discussed, is the fact that no experimental information can be obtained on the imaginary <lb/>part of a FF. In fact, even using polarization observables, only relative phases, (for instance the one between electric and <lb/>magnetic FFs from spin observables [152]) are measurable. <lb/> •  The second problem concerns the impossibility to measure FFs at an arbitrary high momentum transfer, i.e., to access <lb/>asymptotic SL, q <lb/> 2  → −∞,  and TL, q <lb/> 2  → +∞,  regions. The experimental difficulty to reach such regions is also <lb/>accentuated by the fast vanishing behavior of FFs themselves. This problem is less important in the SL region, where the <lb/>knowledge of FFs only in a limited q <lb/> 2 interval could be sufficient. In fact, the DRs treat exclusively SL FFs and inclusively <lb/>(under integration) the TL ones. <lb/></body>

			<body> •  Finally, to evaluate the DR integral, the imaginary part of a FF should be known also in the so-called unphysical region, <lb/>that is, below the production threshold of the process under consideration. <lb/>The first limitation can be easily overcome using, instead of Eq. (61), the DR for the logarithm, given in Eq. (66). The <lb/>advantage is that, in this case, the integral contains moduli of FFs, which are the quantities usually measured in the TL <lb/>region, their values being extracted from the differential cross section data. However to use this DR we have to assume that <lb/>FFs have no zeros in the q <lb/> 2 -complex plane. <lb/>Concerning the asymptotic values, we can now exploit the P–L theorem (Section 3.2.2) to extend also in the TL region <lb/>the well known power-law behavior predicted by pQCD in the SL region. This allows to reproduce the high q <lb/> 2 tail of the DR <lb/>integral. <lb/>The problem of the unphysical region could be treated in different ways. A first possibility consists in using a <lb/>&apos;&apos;suppression&apos;&apos; function that attenuates the unphysical region contribution [153,154]. The idea is due to Ioffe, Geshkenbe˘ ın <lb/>and Shifman [153], who proposed a combination of Legendre polynomials on an opportune variable as suppression function. <lb/>In particular, instead of the function  φ(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  given in Eq. (D.26), they used <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> ln[F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )/F (0)] <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  q  2 <lb/> ,  with: <lb/>   4M 2 <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/>  <lb/> A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>   2  dq <lb/> 2  ≪  1, <lb/>where A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is an analytic function in the q <lb/> 2 complex plane with a cut along the whole negative real axis (SL region) and <lb/>real for q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &gt;  0 (TL region). The DR for the function ñ <lb/> φ(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 1 <lb/> π <lb/>   0 <lb/> −∞ <lb/> Im[  ˜ <lb/> φ(t)] <lb/> t  −  q  2  dt  + <lb/> 1 <lb/> π <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[  ˜ <lb/> φ(t)] <lb/> t  −  q  2  dt, q <lb/> 2  ∈ (0,  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  ), <lb/> (107) <lb/>that in q <lb/> 2  =  0, having  <lb/> (0) =  0, gives <lb/>   0 <lb/> −∞ <lb/> Im[  ˜ <lb/> φ(t)] <lb/> t <lb/>dt  = − <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> Im[  ˜ <lb/> φ(t)] <lb/> t <lb/>dt <lb/>   0 <lb/> −∞ <lb/> Im[A(t)] ln[F  (t)/F (0)] <lb/> t <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  t <lb/> = − <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> q  2 <lb/>t <lb/> A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/> t <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt <lb/>   0 <lb/> −∞ <lb/> Im[A(t)] ln[F  (t)/F (0)] <lb/> t <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  −  t <lb/> ≃ − <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 4M 2 <lb/> A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  ln  |F (t)/F (0)| <lb/> t <lb/>  <lb/> t  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t <lb/> dt. <lb/> (108) <lb/>The approximate identity is due to the effect of the attenuation function A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  that suppresses the contribution of the integral <lb/>in the unphysical region. The advantage of Eq. (108) is that it contains only measurable quantities, the real value of FFs in the <lb/>SL region (left-hand side) and their moduli in the TL region, only from the physical threshold on (right-hand side). However, <lb/>since there are no data on individual FFs in the TL region yet, Eq. (108) is not easily applicable. In Ref. [154] an attempt has <lb/>been made, using in the TL region, genuine values of  |G  M  |,  obtained by means of a dispersive analysis of the pp total cross <lb/>section and data on the ratio  |G  E  |/|G  M  |  [155]. <lb/>The goal of that study was a test of the compatibility of the finite-energy data on G M  and its modulus with the pQCD <lb/>prediction for their asymptotic behavior, that, as a consequence of the P–L theorem (Section 3.2.2), is the same in SL and TL <lb/>large  |q <lb/> 2  |  limits. <lb/>So far, two FF parametrizations have been used in the SL and TL region with a two-fold definition: a fit of all the data and <lb/>a power law in the high  |q <lb/> 2  |  region.

The power n is the only free parameter <lb/>to be determined by requiring the identity of Eq. (108). The obtained result [154] is n  =  2.37  ±  0.36, in agreement with the <lb/>pQCD expectation n  QCD  =  2. This agreement enforces also the initial hypothesis of no zeros for G M  . <lb/>Another possibility to deal with the unphysical region is to consider the FF values in such an interval as unknown to be <lb/>determined by solving an integral equation [156,157]. Even in this case, to include directly data on moduli in TL region, as <lb/>well as to take advantage from the pQCD asymptotic power law, the DR for the logarithm of Eq. (D.29) subtracted at q <lb/> 2  =  0 is <lb/>used, so it is assumed that FFs have no zeros <lb/> 8 . The integral equation is a Fredholm equation of the first kind (see for instance <lb/></body>

The equation is solved numerically using also a regularization <lb/>scheme to avoid instability in the solution. The solving procedure, and mainly the regularization scheme, have been success-<lb/>fully tested in case of the pion FF. The results obtained in Ref. [156] for the moduli of the proton and neutron magnetic FFs in <lb/>the unphysical region, shown as a yellow band in Fig. 21 together with the input values in dark gray, are in agreement with <lb/>the expectation of VMD model. Resonances with masses compatible with those of  ρ, ω, ρ <lb/> ′  and  ω <lb/> ′  mesons have been found. <lb/>Nevertheless, the widths of such structures are larger than the physical ones. This broadening effect could be due to the <lb/>regularization procedure that suppresses narrower resonances, even though, in the case of pion FF the experimental width <lb/>of the  ρ  resonance is well reproduced. Moreover, no  φ(1020)  contribution has been found, in agreement with the OZI rule. <lb/>Finally, since the FFs are completely known, also the phases can be computed. Fig. 22 shows the phase of the proton mag-<lb/>netic FF, in yellow, and that of the pion FF, in dark gray, obtained in Ref. [156]. Their behavior follows the theoretical expecta-<lb/>tions. Indeed, as a consequence of the pQCD power law and the absence of zeros, they have as asymptotic limit 2π and  π  radi-<lb/>ans, respectively. In fact, these limits should be  π (N <lb/> p,π <lb/>G  +N <lb/> p,π <lb/>A  )  radians, where N <lb/> p,π <lb/>G <lb/> is the number of zeros and N <lb/> p,π <lb/>A <lb/> the power <lb/>of 1/q <lb/> 2 that drives the asymptotic vanishing behavior, see Eq. (77) and Section 3.2.8. In both the cases N <lb/> p,π <lb/>G <lb/> =  0, because the <lb/>FFs have no zeros. From pQCD, N <lb/> p <lb/>A  =  2 for the proton while it is N <lb/> π <lb/> A  =  1 for the pion, hence both limits are in agreement. <lb/> 5.2.3. A dispersive analysis for the ratio G E  /G  M <lb/> In most of the cases the possibility of exploiting DRs in a model independent way to handle FFs is spoiled by the lack <lb/>of suitable sets of data. In fact, data on the same FF in SL and TL regions should be known to perform a direct dispersive <lb/>analysis. As already indicated, TL data are usually given for a particular combination of moduli of FFs, e.g., the effective FF <lb/> G  eff , that has no SL correspondent, as a combination of real SL FFs having G  eff as modulus does not exist. <lb/>So far, the only combination of FFs that has been measured in the SL region as a real quantity, and in TL region as its <lb/>modulus, is the normalized ratio R <lb/> p  = µ  p G E  /G  M  for the proton. Moreover, as discussed in Section 4.1.2, the most recent <lb/>experiments done by means of polarization transfer experiments, provided data, more precise and less radiative-corrections <lb/></body>

In the TL region there are only two <lb/>sets of data, the first is from the PS170 experiment at LEAR [8], the second is from BaBar at SLAC [9,88]. <lb/>The analytic properties of the ratio R(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  derive from those of the electric and magnetic FFs. In particular it has the same <lb/>discontinuity cut  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞)  and a constant asymptotic limit, because G E  and G M  vanish with the same power-law. Moreover, <lb/>assuming a magnetic FF with no zeros, additional singularities for R <lb/> p <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are excluded, hence its analyticity domain coincides <lb/>with that of G E  and G M  . <lb/>The advantages of the dispersive analysis performed directly on the ratio and, in particular, based on its imaginary part, <lb/>described in Refs. [155,157,159,160], are the following: <lb/> •  Since the resonant contributions in the unphysical region are the same for G E  and G M  , their effect should cancel out in <lb/>the ratio that, as a consequence, has a small imaginary part in this region, i.e., an almost vanishing phase. <lb/> •  The imaginary part of R <lb/> p  is strongly constrained. It must be zero at the theoretical threshold 4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  , at the physical threshold <lb/>4M <lb/> 2 , where R <lb/> p  = µ  p  and so it is real, as well as at infinity, because both G E  and G M  vanish. <lb/> •  Finally, once a parametrization for the imaginary part of the ratio over the discontinuity cut is established, DRs can be <lb/>used to perform a rigorous analytic continuation in the whole q <lb/> 2 complex plane. <lb/>To exploit all these features, the subtracted DR of Eq. (63) has been used and the imaginary part of R <lb/> p  has been <lb/>parametrized with two series of orthogonal polynomials. The first series is defined in the unphysical region  (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ,  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> and the second over the remaining part of the cut  (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ∞),  i.e., <lb/> ρ(C,  D, t)  ≡  Im[R <lb/> p <lb/> (t)] = θ (t −  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π ) θ (4M <lb/> 2  −  t) <lb/> N <lb/>  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> C j T j  (t) + θ (t −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> M <lb/>  <lb/> k=1 <lb/> D k S k  (t), <lb/> where  {T  j  (t)} <lb/> N <lb/>j=1  and  {S  k  (t)} <lb/> M <lb/>k=1  are the polynomials, C  = (C  1  ,  C  2  , . . . ,  C N  )  and D  = (D  1  ,  D  2  , . . . ,  D M  )  are the corresponding <lb/>coefficients to be determined by fitting data and imposing the analyticity constraints. The complete expression for R <lb/> p  is <lb/> R <lb/> p <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  1  + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> π <lb/> PV <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 4m 2 <lb/> π <lb/> ρ(C,  D, t) <lb/>t(t  −  q  2  ) <lb/> dt  +  i  ρ(C,  D, q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> (111) <lb/>that holds for every complex q <lb/> 2  ̸ ∈ (4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , ∞).  The best values for the free parameters have been determined by minimizing <lb/>a  χ <lb/> 2 that includes both experimental and theoretical contributions. Moreover, since the PS170 and BaBar TL measurements <lb/>are somehow inconsistent, their data have been treated separately. In the first case, called PS170 case, all the SL polarization <lb/>data are considered in connection with the only PS170 TL points, while in the second case, called simply BaBar case, the <lb/>same SL data are related to the BaBar measurements together with two additional points from FENICE, DM2 and E835 <lb/>experiments [155]. <lb/>Results of this dispersive analysis are shown in Fig. 23. The obtained analytic parametrization can be extended also <lb/>outside the data regions and hence it is possible to predict not only the finite q <lb/> 2 behavior but also the asymptotic one. <lb/>In particular, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 23, a SL zero is predicted, in both cases, at <lb/> t <lb/> BaBar <lb/>0 <lb/> = (−10 ±  1) GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> t <lb/> PS170 <lb/>0 <lb/> = (−7.9 ±  0.7) GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> and, at least in the data region, the two descriptions are quite similar. <lb/></body>

SL (left panel) and TL (right panel) dispersive parametrization and data for the ratio (TL values above the theoretical threshold 4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  are for the <lb/>modulus of R <lb/> p  ). The grid band represents the result obtained using in the TL region only PS170 data [8], while the light gray band is the description achieved <lb/>including all TL but those of PS170. SL data are from Refs. [64,161,66,63], TL data are from Ref. [9] (solid triangles), Ref. [155] (empty triangles) and Ref. [8] <lb/>(empty squares). The empty diamond indicate the theoretical constraints and the vertical dashed line, in the right panel, is the physical threshold q <lb/> 2  =  4M <lb/> 2 . <lb/> The right panel of Fig. 23 shows the TL modulus of the ratio. In the unphysical region it is quite smooth as expected, while <lb/>at higher q <lb/> 2 the two descriptions, following the tendency of the different sets of data, have opposite trends. Concerning the <lb/>constant asymptotic limit, which, as a consequence of the P–L theorem, must be the same in SL and TL regions, as well as in <lb/>any direction in the complex plane, it is found that <lb/>lim <lb/> q  2  →±∞ <lb/> G E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> G M  (q  2  ) <lb/> = <lb/>  <lb/> −0.95 ±  0.20 BaBar <lb/> −2.3 ±  0.7 <lb/>PS170 <lb/> . <lb/> It is interesting to notice that the limits are negative, because there is a unique SL zero, i.e., the ratio changes sign only once, <lb/>so it remains negative as q <lb/> 2  → −∞  and also as q <lb/> 2  → ∞,  due to the P–L theorem. <lb/>Moreover, in the BaBar case the limit seems to reproduce the scaling, i.e.,  |G  E  | = |G  M  |,  usually assumed in the TL region <lb/>to extract information about the nucleon structure from the cross section, but in this case, one should find G E  ≃ −G  M  &lt;  0 <lb/>as q <lb/> 2  → ±∞. <lb/> The phase of R <lb/> p  can be also predicted. This represents a measurable quantity, in fact, contrary to pure phases of FFs, the <lb/>relative phase between G E  and G M  , i.e., the phase of their ratio, is experimentally accessible, by measuring the polarization <lb/>of an outgoing nucleon in the process e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p. Fig. 24 shows the predictions for the phase of the BaBar (light <lb/>gray band) and PS170 (grid band) case. The earlier appears more interesting because the expected limit value for an analytic <lb/>function with a zero and a finite limit as q <lb/> 2  → ∞,  i.e.,  π  radians (see discussion at the end of Section 5.2.2), is already <lb/>reached at q <lb/> 2  ∼  10 GeV <lb/> 2 , which is a kinematical region accessible to the current experiments. <lb/> 5.3. PQCD parametrization <lb/> Elastic ep scattering, at the quark level, is described by the Feynman diagram illustrated in Fig. 25: the virtual photon <lb/>interacts with the proton leaving the proton unchanged after transferring the momentum to each of the quarks, through the <lb/>gluon exchange. Taking the gluon propagator of the form 1/Q <lb/> 2 as for vector massive particles, pQCD predicts the asymptotic <lb/>behavior of the nucleon FFs at large momentum transfer squared in terms of quark counting rules. In Refs. [35,36], it was <lb/>shown that, in the general case, the differential cross section for two particle collision at high momentum transfer can be <lb/>written as: <lb/> dσ <lb/>dt <lb/> (AB →  CD)  ∼  s <lb/> −n+2  f  (t/s) ∼ |G  eff  (s)| <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> (112) <lb/>where n is the total number of the fields in the particles A, B, C and D carrying a finite fraction of the momentum. For elastic <lb/>electron–nucleon scattering n  =  2(n  h  −  1) where within the quark model, n h  =  3 (three valence quarks). The function <lb/> f  (t/s)  depends on the scattering angle. It follows that the nucleon electromagnetic FF behaves, at large t, as: <lb/> G  eff  (s) ∼  s <lb/> 1−n  h  . <lb/> (113) <lb/></body>

Comparison of the TL world data, with the parametrizations as in Table 5: (1) (black solid line); (2) (red dashed line); (3) (blue dash-dotted line); <lb/>and (4) (green dotted line). <lb/> Therefore we can summarize as follows: <lb/> •  QCD can predict only the q <lb/> 2 dependence, from quark counting, which must be the same for electric and magnetic FFs, as <lb/>it depends only on the number of quarks which are involved in the reaction; <lb/> •  The &apos;fitting coefficient&apos; cannot be different for G E  and G M  , because in TL region, FF must obey G E  =  G M  at threshold. This <lb/>should be precisely tested when the individual extraction of TL FFs will be possible; <lb/> •  In TL region the analytic continuation originates an imaginary part. However, this simple model assumes a relative phase <lb/>between G E  and G M  equal to zero. The measurement of this relative phase in experiments using polarization observables <lb/>will be a test of the applicability of QCD. <lb/> 5.4. Chiral perturbation theory <lb/> Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has proved to be successful in the limit where the coupling constant  α  s  is small, <lb/>and degrees of freedom other that quarks and gluons can be ignored. On the other hand, for low momentum transfer <lb/>(Q <lb/> 2  ≤  Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> QCD  ),  α  s  increases and the theory, losing its perturbative character, does not provide a good description of the <lb/>observation. In other words, QCD is not adequate to explain phenomena as confinement and generation of the hadron <lb/>masses. Nevertheless, effective field theories (EFTs) of strong interaction at low-Q <lb/> 2 , hence equivalent to QCD, can be <lb/>developed exploiting basic symmetries. An EFT represents an approximation of a fundamental (maybe unknown) theory <lb/>whose relevant degrees of freedom depend on a characteristic energy scale, usually called  Λ.  Such a scale defines the <lb/>boundary between the fundamental and the effective regime. <lb/>Depending on the nature of the effective degrees of freedom, two classes of EFTs can be defined. To the first class belong <lb/>EFTs that poses as effective degrees of freedom a subset of those of the underlying fundamental theory. An example is the <lb/>Standard Model, which is interpreted as the low-energy approximation of a fundamental theory whose heavy degrees of <lb/>freedom, i.e., those with energy higher than a given scale, have been integrated out. <lb/>The second class, instead, is characterized by degrees of freedom which are different from the fundamental ones. The <lb/>transition from fundamental to effective level is a phase transition driven by a spontaneous breakdown of the chiral <lb/>symmetry. <lb/>Renormalizability of EFTs is ruled by the scale-dependence of theories themselves. In fact, in case of first class theories, <lb/>the non-renormalizable couplings that appear in the Lagrangian are suppressed by inverse powers of the  Λ  scale. The <lb/>theories of the second class are effectively non-renormalizable. Nevertheless, below the given scale  Λ,  only a finite number <lb/>of counterterms is needed to make them finite. <lb/>The QCD Lagrangian, in terms of the &apos;&apos;perturbative&apos;&apos; degrees of freedom, gluons and quarks, is <lb/> L  QCD  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> G <lb/> a <lb/> µν  G <lb/> µν  a  + <lb/> N f <lb/>  <lb/> f <lb/> q f <lb/>  <lb/> iγ <lb/> µ  D  µ  −  m f <lb/>  <lb/> q f  . <lb/> Here, the non-abelian field strength tensor G <lb/> µν  describes the gluons and q f  is the spinor of quarks of flavor f . N f  represents <lb/>the number of flavors that are considered. Including only light quarks, i.e., with m f  ≪  Λ  ∼  1 GeV, mass terms can be <lb/>neglected and the QCD Lagrangian acquires an SU(N  f  )  L  ×  SU(N  f  )  R  ×  U(1)  V  symmetry, besides the discrete ones.

Considering only u and d quarks (N  f  =  2) the pseudo-Goldstone bosons are the <lb/>three pions. <lb/>The weakness of the interaction makes possible an expansion, called chiral expansion, in the external momentum, that <lb/>converges below a typical scale of the theory. Such a scale corresponds to the mass of heavier hadron (besides the pions), <lb/>which in turn appears in the spectrum, hence, with N f  =  2, we have  Λ  ∼  m  ρ  ∼  1 GeV. The massless quark approximation <lb/>can also be relaxed by introducing a further expansion in m f  . These finite masses are responsible for the physical mass of <lb/>the pions, pseudo-Goldstone bosons. It follows that the chiral expansion is done in two variables: the external momentum <lb/>and the quark mass. It needs a power counting procedure that, ranking each terms with the correct expansion order, called <lb/> chiral rank, allows to identify leading terms and hence to make physical predictions. <lb/>The resulting EFT, called  χPT,  can be formulated in terms of the only pseudo-Goldstone bosons. It follows that the  χPT <lb/> Lagrangian, equivalent to  L  QCD [162,163], is the most general one that embodies the required symmetries and depends on <lb/>the observed hadronic fields [164]: <lb/> L  QCD [q, q, G <lb/> µν  ]  −→  L  χ  PT <lb/>  <lb/> U,  ∂U, . . . ,  M,  v µ ,  a  µ <lb/>  , <lb/> (122) <lb/>where U is a unitary matrix field for the pseudo-Goldstone bosons,  M  describes the mass matrix, the vector and axial fields <lb/> v µ  and a  µ  account for the interaction with photons and W bosons, respectively. <lb/>The ellipsis in Eq. (122) stand for the not included heavy fields. Their effects are parametrized by low-energy constants <lb/>(LECs) appearing in the chiral expansions. Some of such constants exhibit a scale-dependence, which is defined to reabsorb <lb/>the one in the loop diagrams of the renormalization scheme, so that the physical quantities preserve the scale-independence. <lb/>The LEC values, which are not ruled by the symmetries of the theory, are however constrained by various observables. <lb/>The ab initio determination of LECs, solving non-perturbative QCD problems, is a very difficult task <lb/> 9 , hence the usual <lb/>procedure to obtain their values consists in using both experimental and theoretical information. Phenomenological <lb/>approaches as: matching to dispersion theory measured hadron properties, as well as the so-called resonance saturation <lb/>are commonly used [166–168]. <lb/>The extension of  χPT  to include nucleons, besides pions, is done by inserting explicitly matter fields in the Lagrangian of <lb/>Eq. (122), so that it can be written as series of terms with increasing chiral rank [169] <lb/> L  χPT  = <lb/>  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> L <lb/> (2j) <lb/>ππ  + <lb/>  <lb/> k=1 <lb/> L <lb/> (k) <lb/>πN  =  L <lb/> (2) <lb/>ππ  +  L <lb/> (1) <lb/>πN  +  L <lb/> (2) <lb/>πN  +  L <lb/> (3) <lb/>πN  +  L <lb/> (4) <lb/>π  N  +  L <lb/> (4) <lb/>π π  +  O(p <lb/> 5 <lb/> ), <lb/> (123) <lb/>where the number superscript in each term stands just for the chiral rank, given in integer powers of the external momentum <lb/> p. The last member of Eq. (123) contains an explicit expression of the effective  π  N relativistic Lagrangian at the chiral rank <lb/> p <lb/> 4 . We briefly describe the contributions to this  O(p <lb/> 4 <lb/> )-Lagrangian,  following Ref. [170], where special attention is given to <lb/>nucleon FFs determination, Ref. [171] and references therein. <lb/>Starting from the lowest chiral rank terms, we have the pion Lagrangian  L <lb/> (2) <lb/>π π  that, at leading order <lb/> 10 , depends on two <lb/>parameters only: the pion decay constant F  π  and the pion mass  <lb/>   π  (the tilde stands for leading term in the quark mass <lb/>expansion). Also the lowest rank  π  N contribution,  L <lb/> (1) <lb/>πN  , at leading order, contains only two parameters: the nucleon mass <lb/> M and the axial–vector coupling g A  . (Note that in SL region, the axial form factor can be obtained directly through the reaction <lb/> ν µ  +  p  → µ <lb/> + +  n, or indirectly through charged pion electroproduction near-threshold experiments; in TL region it may <lb/>be investigated through the reaction  ¯ <lb/> p  +  p  →  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − + π <lb/> −  ). <lb/>Contribution of rank two, three and four contain LECs, c j  , d j  and e j  , hence, referring to the only terms which are relevant <lb/>for nucleon FFs [172,170]: <lb/> L <lb/> (2) <lb/>πN  =  L <lb/> (2) <lb/>π  N  (c  1  ,  c  2  ,  c  4  ,  c  6  ,  c  7  ), <lb/> L <lb/> (3) <lb/>πN  =  L <lb/> (3) <lb/>πN (d  6  ,  d  7  ), <lb/> L <lb/> (4) <lb/>πN  =  L <lb/> (4) <lb/>π  N  (e  54  ,  e  74  ,  e  105  ,  e  106  ). <lb/> The complete leading-order  L <lb/> (4) <lb/>πN  contains 118 terms [169], however only the four reported here are important for FFs. As <lb/>already discussed, such constants, that account for short distance effects not explicitly included in this effective Lagrangian, <lb/>have to be separately determined. Generally they are evaluated using phenomenological procedures that rely on data. In <lb/>this case, data on  π  N scattering, leading magnetic photon–nucleon coupling and nucleon charge radii have to be used. <lb/></body>

			<body> Parameters and LECs are, as usually, renormalized considering higher order contributions (in perturbation theory) and, as <lb/>previously pointed out, the scale dependence of renormalized LECs is used to compensate infinite arising from regularization <lb/>of physical quantities. For instance, the pion mass, that vanishes in the chiral limit (massless quarks), has a chiral expansion <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  = ˜ <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  − <lb/>¯  l  3 <lb/> 32π 2  F  2 <lb/> π <lb/> ˜ <lb/> m <lb/> 4 <lb/> π  +  O(  ˜ <lb/> m <lb/> 6 <lb/> π ). <lb/> (124) <lb/>The renormalized LEC  ¯  l  3 , which depends logarithmically by  <lb/>   π  , cancels out the infinite contribution coming from the pion <lb/>tadpole [170]. The same scheme does not work in case of the nucleon mass, because in the chiral limit it is not vanishing <lb/>and receives infinite renormalization contribution. To overcome this limitation, a heavy mass expansion for the nucleons <lb/>was also considered. However, this further expansion implies a new mass scale that could spoil the analyticity of some <lb/>amplitude and hence that of resulting FFs [173]. This problem can be overcome using the so-called infrared regularization <lb/>procedure [174]. This relativistic approach allows to construct amplitudes that have the desired analyticity properties. <lb/>Since the Dirac and Pauli FFs appear in the electromagnetic current with coefficients that have different q <lb/> 2 -behavior, see <lb/>Eq. (20), their expressions from  χPT  at a given chiral rank have different accuracy. In this case, starting from a rank-four <lb/>Lagrangian, we have <lb/> F  1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  O(q <lb/> 3 <lb/> ), <lb/> F  2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  O(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ). <lb/> These ranks mix, when the Sachs FFs are considered. <lb/>Expressions of all nucleon FFs, F <lb/> p,n <lb/> 1,2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  can be obtained accounting for both tree and loop contributions described <lb/>by the chiral rank-four Lagrangian of Eq. (123) and, once the LECs have been pinned down, their q <lb/> 2 behavior can be <lb/>compared with available data. However, since these expressions hold in a low-|q <lb/> 2  |  region, for instance in case of Ref. [170] <lb/> |q <lb/> 2  | ≤  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> χ  =  0.4 GeV <lb/> 2 , and usually well below the TL physical threshold q <lb/> 2  =  4M <lb/> 2  ≃  3.53 GeV <lb/> 2 , the only possibility is to <lb/>check the results in the SL region, hence for  −q <lb/> 2  ≤  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> χ  . <lb/>By taking advantage from unitarity and then from the optical theorem, is it possible to compute spectral functions of <lb/>FFs, i.e., their imaginary parts in the TL region [175,173,170], with 4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  ≤  q <lb/> 2  ≤  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> χ  . It is interesting to notice that, as <lb/>pointed out in Ref. [170], the spectral functions of the isovector FFs obtained in the heavy baryon scheme, contrary to those <lb/>computed with the infrared regularization approach, do not fulfill the required threshold behavior, as q <lb/> 2  →  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  . This is a <lb/>clear manifestation of the wrong analyticity given by the heavy baryon scheme. <lb/>Comparing to SL measurements, the obtained FF expressions follow the data only in a very low-q <lb/> 2 region, where the <lb/>imposed normalization forces the agreement. At higher values of  |q <lb/> 2  |  the discrepancy increases by making clear the absence <lb/>of terms in  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 or higher orders, especially for the three Sachs FFs that show a dipole behavior, i.e., G <lb/> p,n <lb/>M  and G <lb/> n <lb/>M  . In fact the <lb/>polynomial parts of the FF expression contain only linear terms in q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>This lack is interpreted as a phenomenological indication that vector meson contributions are also needed. Such <lb/>contributions are crucial in other descriptions of FFs as those based on VMD, Section 5.1, and dispersive analyses, Section 5.2. <lb/>So far, in the rank-four  χPT,  the high order (≥2) q <lb/> 2 -behavior of vector meson propagators, e.g. <lb/>1 <lb/>1  −  q  2  /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> V <lb/> =  1  + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> V <lb/> + <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> V <lb/>   2 <lb/> +  O <lb/>  <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 3   <lb/> , <lb/> has been integrated out in LECs, hence FF expressions account for the single term of this propagator expansion which is <lb/>linear in q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The easier way to consider explicitly vector mesons is to include them dynamically [170]. The other possibility, which <lb/>consists in extending the chiral analysis at higher orders, would imply new unknown constants. Hence, following the <lb/>procedure of Ref. [170], where vector mesons have been included using the spin-one antisymmetric tensor field from <lb/>Ref. [176], LECs have new expressions of the form <lb/> λ <lb/> VM <lb/> k  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = ˜ <lb/> λ  k  + <lb/>  <lb/> α <lb/> A  α (λ  k  ) <lb/> m  2 <lb/> α  −  q  2  , <lb/> (125) <lb/>where  λ =  c, d, e is a LEC, the term  <lb/>  k  describes effects not due to vector mesons <lb/> 11 ,  α = ρ, ω, φ  is a vector meson and A  α (λ  k  ) <lb/> is the product of coupling constants of the vector meson  α  to the photon and to the NN state for the  λ  k  LEC. Not all vector <lb/>mesons contribute to all LECs and hence some coefficients A  α (λ  k  )  could be zero. Vector meson-NN coupling constants can <lb/>be determined, for instance, in dispersive analyses of FFs, while masses and photon–vector meson couplings are extracted <lb/>from cross section data of processes like e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − →  vector meson  →  hadrons. In light of the definition given in Eq. (125), the <lb/>resonance saturation procedure, previously introduced as a technique to evaluate LECs, can be now explicitly understood. It <lb/>is just the value of  <lb/>  k  that measures the amount of resonance saturation of a given LEC. For instance if  <lb/>  k  /⟨λ <lb/> VM <lb/> k  ⟩ −q  2  ≤q  2  χ  ≪  1, <lb/></body>

[170] using the described relativistic and infrared regularized  χPT,  to the fourth order, including <lb/>(solid line) and not including vector mesons (dashed line). <lb/>Apart from G <lb/> n <lb/>E  , the only not-dipole shaped Sachs FF, the descriptions obtained not including vector mesons (dashed lines <lb/>in Figs. 28–30), fail in reproducing the data trends. In particular, it is evident the lack of &apos;&apos;curvature&apos;&apos;, that could be obtained <lb/>by including terms of order higher than q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The dynamical inclusion of light vector meson, which is summarized in Eq. (125), allows to recover the required high-<lb/>order q <lb/> 2 dependence in FF expressions by changing the q <lb/> 2 functional forms of LECs. The additional parameters, like meson <lb/>masses and coupling constants are taken from data or from other analyses, in particular, in this case, the parameters are <lb/>from Ref. [140]. The new descriptions of Sachs FFs, shown in Figs. 28–31 as solid lines, are in good agreement with the data <lb/>being now able to reproduce the dipole behavior of the proton FFs and of G <lb/> n <lb/>M  . <lb/>However, the goodness of these descriptions relies in the fact that the procedure of dynamical introduction of vector <lb/>mesons in LECs mimics VMD and the relevant coupling constants used in this description derive from a dispersive <lb/>analysis [140] also based on VMD. The similarity of this  χPT  approach and the dispersive one is moreover sharpened by <lb/>the resonance saturation of several LECs. <lb/>The possibility to extend this  χPT  descriptions of FFs in the TL region is strongly reduced by the low-|q <lb/> 2  |  nature of  χPT <lb/> itself. Nevertheless, as already mentioned, spectral functions of FFs, which are defined in the TL region above the physical <lb/>threshold q <lb/> 2  =  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  , can be computed in  χPT  using the optical theorem. In principle, by means of DRs (see Section 3.2.3), <lb/>FFs can be reconstructed, or analytically continued, in the whole q <lb/> 2 complex plane starting from their spectral functions. <lb/>However, to exploit DRs in this way, spectral functions should be known from threshold up to high-q <lb/> 2 values (few/several <lb/>GeV <lb/> 2 ), in contrast to what is obtained from  χPT.  Such a limitation could be, at least partially, overcome either by introducing <lb/>vector mesons, or by using subtracted DRs. In fact, similarly to vector mesons, FFs acquire in the SL region the desired dipole <lb/>behavior and hence the introduction of vector mesons could also help in having spectral functions vanishing at high TL q <lb/> 2 , <lb/>well suitable for DR purposes. In addition, adopting subtracted DRs would help in suppressing the high q <lb/> 2 contributions, <lb/>that are not well under control. Once a &apos;&apos;stable&apos;&apos; spectral function is obtained, not only TL, but also SL FFs can be computed <lb/>at any q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>So far there have not been attempts to perform this kind of studies (based on  χPT,  VMD and DRs) of nucleon FFs. <lb/> 5.5. Soliton models <lb/> The basic idea behind the possibility of describing nucleons and their FFs by means of soliton models is that, in the limit <lb/>of large number of colors, N c  → ∞,  QCD can be approximated by a non-linear field theory with only mesonic degrees of <lb/>freedom [177,101], where baryons arise as stationary topological solutions. Such stable solutions represent solitary, spatially <lb/>localized, objects called solitons. <lb/> As already indicated in Section 5.4, in the chiral limit, i.e., considering massless quarks, the effective, chiral Lagrangian <lb/>is equivalent to that of QCD has the form given in Eq. (122). As a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the chiral <lb/></body>

These terms account for the axial anomaly, in a chiral-invariant form (for details see for <lb/>instance Refs.

The <lb/>resulting Lagrangian is the so-called Skyrme model [182] <lb/> L <lb/> Skyrme  = <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/> π <lb/> 4 <lb/>Tr <lb/>  <lb/> ∂ µ  U∂ <lb/> µ  U <lb/> Ď   <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/>32 g  2 Tr <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> ∂ µ  UU <lb/> Ď <lb/> , ∂ ν  UU <lb/> Ď    2 <lb/>  <lb/> +  L  WZ  +  L  m  π , <lb/> (127) <lb/>where g is an arbitrary parameter.

Hence, including vector mesons appear <lb/>as a mandatory step also in this case. <lb/>Following the original idea of Bando et al. [183] and further works of Meissner et al. [184], one can notice that the <lb/>Lagrangian of Eq. (126) has a hidden local SU(2)  VM gauge symmetry (the subscript VM stands for vector mesons). This <lb/>appears by writing the unitary field as U(x)  = ξ <lb/> Ď <lb/> L  (x)ξ  R  (x),  where  ξ  R,L  are SU(2) fields, i.e., they transform under local isospin <lb/>rotations by leaving U unchanged. This is the reason why the symmetry is hidden. Considering  ξ  R,L  as genuine fields to be <lb/>included, with their own dynamics, in the starting Lagrangian we obtain <lb/> L <lb/> Skyrme <lb/> ρ <lb/> =  L <lb/> (2) <lb/>ππ  + λ  L  ρ  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> ⃗ <lb/> ρ µν  · ⃗ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µν <lb/> , <lb/> (128) <lb/>where  λ  is an arbitrary parameter,  L  ρ  is rank-four and contains gauge-covariant derivatives D  µ  = ∂ µ  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> i g  ⃗ <lb/> τ · ⃗ <lb/> ρ µ  , in terms <lb/>of the coupling g and the non abelian gauge field  ⃗ <lb/> ρ µ  ,  ⃗ <lb/> ρ µν  is the corresponding, non-abelian, field tensor. <lb/>Using the weak-field expansion in the gauge where  ξ  L  = ξ  R  , the expression of Eq. (128) becomes the well known  ρπ <lb/> Lagrangian [185], where: m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ  = λ  g <lb/> 2  F <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  , g  ρππ  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> λ  g and hence setting  λ =  2 we get the KSFR relation [186] <lb/> m  ρ  = <lb/>√ <lb/> 2 g  ρππ  F  π . <lb/> In this case the  ρπ π  coupling can be determined from the experimental values of the  ρ  mass, m  ρ  ≃  770 MeV, and the decay <lb/>width  Γ (ρ → π π )  and it is: g  ρππ  ≃  5.85. <lb/>Besides the isovector meson  ρ,  also the isoscalar meson  ω  can be included by means of the same procedure. In particular <lb/>the hidden gauge symmetry is enlarged from the original one SU(2) to SU(2)  ×  U(1) so that there are four gauge bosons, <lb/>the three  ρ&apos;s  for the SU(2) group, and an additional boson, the  ω  meson, for U(1).

It consists in assigning to the <lb/>vector field  ⃗ <lb/> π (x)  in the isospin space, the same direction of the position vector  ⃗  r in the coordinate space, i.e. <lb/> ⃗ <lb/> π (x) =  F  π  F  (r) ˆ <lb/> r, <lb/>U  =  exp <lb/>  <lb/> i  ⃗ <lb/> τ · ˆ <lb/> r F  (r) <lb/>  , <lb/> (130) <lb/>where the function F  (r)  represents the intensity of the vector field  ⃗ <lb/> π (x)  and it is called chiral angle. A stable solution is <lb/>represented by a particular profile of the field U(x) that minimizes the energy <lb/>Energy  = − <lb/>  <lb/> L <lb/> Skyrme <lb/> (ρω)  [U(x)]d <lb/> 3  x. <lb/> Under the hedgehog assumption and considering, for instance, the Lagrangian of Eq. (127), without vector mesons, the <lb/>minimum condition is represented by a non-linear, second order, differential equation for the chiral angle F  (r). <lb/> When vector mesons are included, the new Lagrangian given in Eq. (129) contains two additional gauge fields  ω µ  and <lb/> ⃗ <lb/> ρ µ  , for the isoscalar meson  ω  and the isovector  ρ,  respectively. Assuming for the isoscalar field the only time component <lb/>and using the Wu–Yang ansatz [187] for the isovector one (that turns out to have only space components) such fields can be <lb/>described by two additional scalar functions, also called chiral profiles,  ω(r)  and G(r). The energy-minimization, that allows <lb/>to find stable solutions, gives now three second-order, non-linear, differential equations. The boundary conditions on the <lb/>chiral profiles  ω(r)  and G(r) are determined by requiring finite energy solutions [184,188,189], while those for the chiral <lb/>angle F  (r)  follow from the need of a unitary baryon number. <lb/>The solitons obtained by solving the differential equations on the three chiral profiles F  (r), ω(r)  and G(r) are quantized. <lb/>Quantization is needed to reconstruct physical baryons, i.e., eigenstate of spin and isospin (due to the hedgehog assumption <lb/>each spin eigenstate is automatically an isospin eigenstate and vice versa). The quantization procedure introduces three <lb/>further radial functions,  ξ  1  (r), ξ  2  (r)  and  φ(r),  that can be computed in terms of the profiles F  (r), ω(r)  and G(r) and generates <lb/>also spatial components for the  ω µ  field, as well as time components for  ⃗ <lb/> ρ <lb/> µ  . The baryon mass is computed as a &apos;&apos;byproduct&apos;&apos; <lb/>of the quantization procedure. <lb/>Finally, it is important to stress that the Skyrme model, hence the description of baryons as solitons emerging from the <lb/>Lagrangian of Eq. (129), has no free parameters. <lb/> Nucleon form factors in the Skyrme model <lb/> The nucleon FFs are obtained as Fourier transforms of the electromagnetic current components. In the Skyrme model <lb/>such components are combination of chiral profiles, radial functions and their derivatives. In Ref. [184], for instance, isospin <lb/>components of the Sachs FFs have been considered, and their expressions in the Breit frame, i.e., q <lb/> 2  = −⃗  q <lb/> 2 , are <lb/> G <lb/> S <lb/>E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> dr r <lb/> 2  j  0  (qr)F [ω;  r] <lb/>G <lb/> V <lb/>E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> dr r <lb/> 2  j  0  (qr)F [F ,  F <lb/> ′ <lb/> , ξ  1  , ξ  2  , φ;  r] <lb/>G <lb/> S <lb/>M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> dr <lb/>r <lb/>q <lb/>j  1  (qr)F [φ;  r] <lb/>G <lb/> V <lb/>M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>   ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> dr <lb/>r <lb/>q <lb/>j  1  (qr)F [F ,  F <lb/> ′ <lb/> ,  G; r], <lb/> (131) <lb/>where the j k  (x)  is the kth spherical Bessel function, q  = <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 and  F  [f  1  r,  . . . ,  f n  ;  r] stands for an opportune combination <lb/>of functions f  1  (r), . . . ,  f n  (r),  depending on the single variable r. <lb/> These FFs, however, describe the structure of a non-relativistic nucleon. As a matter of fact, the quantization has been <lb/>done assuming small fluctuations of the soliton fields with respect to the soliton mass itself. In other words to obtain reliable <lb/>FFs also at high  |q <lb/> 2  |,  relativistic corrections are needed. A possible procedure to implement such corrections is the so-called <lb/> quantization after boosting technique [190–192], that considers to boost the classical soliton <lb/> 12 and then to quantize it in <lb/></body>

The procedure in SL and TL region gives the following relations <lb/> G E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  G <lb/> nr <lb/> E <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1  −  q  2  /(4M  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  −  q  2  /(4M  2  ) <lb/> G <lb/> nr <lb/> M <lb/>  <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1  −  q  2  /(4M  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &lt;  0) <lb/> G E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  G <lb/> nr <lb/> E <lb/>  <lb/> 4M <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> 2  − <lb/> 4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> 4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2  G <lb/> nr <lb/> M <lb/>  <lb/> 4M <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> 2  − <lb/> 4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &gt;  0), <lb/>where the superscript &apos;&apos;nr&apos;&apos; stands for non-relativistic. The effect of such a procedure is, as expected, negligible at low  |q <lb/> 2  |, <lb/> in particular the FFs values at q <lb/> 2  =  0 and q <lb/> 2  =  4M <lb/> 2 are unchanged: G E,M  (0) =  G <lb/> nr <lb/> E,M  (0)  and G E,M  (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  G <lb/> nr <lb/> E,M  (4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  while <lb/>at high  |q <lb/> 2  | <lb/> lim <lb/> q  2  →−∞ <lb/> G E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  G <lb/> nr <lb/> E  (−4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> lim <lb/> q  2  →−∞ <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> 1 <lb/> −q  2 <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &lt;  0) <lb/>lim <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/> G E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  G <lb/> nr <lb/> E  (8M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> lim <lb/> q  2  →∞ <lb/> G M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼ <lb/> 1 <lb/> q  2 <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &gt;  0). <lb/>The relativistic correction fails in reproducing the pQCD power-law, that follows a dipole behavior, for all the FFs. Moreover <lb/>in case of G E  a constant limit, in both SL and TL region is obtained. A possibility to recover the pQCD asymptotic behavior <lb/>could be that of tuning FFs so that: G <lb/> nr <lb/> E,M  (−4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> dG  nr <lb/> E <lb/> dq  2  (−4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  0, in the SL region, and G <lb/> nr <lb/> E,M  (8M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> dG  nr <lb/> E <lb/> dq  2  (8M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  0 in <lb/>the TL region. It is important and fair to stress that the asymptotic behavior is completely determined by the boost procedure <lb/>and not by the Skyrme model that, instead, describes the low  |q <lb/> 2  |  values of FFs. <lb/>Expressions of Eq. (131) are representations of FFs defined only in the SL region, i.e., the Fourier integrals converge only <lb/>for negative q <lb/> 2 and hence for real values of q  = <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 . A possible extension in the TL region of such expressions could be <lb/>obtained by an analytic integration that would give analytic functions of q <lb/> 2 and hence FF expressions valid in the whole <lb/>complex plane. The difficulty in making analytic integrations lies in the fact that the functions  F  [. . . ;  r] (ellipsis stand for a <lb/>set of chiral profile, radial functions and eventually their derivatives), that appear in the Fourier integrals, are obtained only <lb/>as numerical solutions of differential equations. <lb/>A procedure to perform analytic continuations of the profile and radial functions and then for FFs has been suggested in <lb/>Ref. [193]. The idea is to fit the numerical solutions of the differential equations with functions that are defined as a ratio <lb/>of polynomials multiplied by the peculiar exponential, obtained as the asymptotic (r  → ∞)  solution of the differential <lb/>equations. In this simple case all the integrals of Eq. (131) can be solved in terms of the well-known exponential integral <lb/>function E  1  (z)  [194]. Such function has a very interesting analytic structure that is suitable for FFs, as it follows the Schwarz <lb/>reflection principle [see Eq. (D.14)] and hence it is real for real values of the argument and has a branch cut which, in FFs <lb/>definition, turns out to be the expected TL discontinuity cut. Figs. 32 and 33 show Sachs FFs in the SL region and the TL <lb/>effective FF of the proton, as obtained with the procedure of Ref. [193], compared with corresponding data. It is interesting <lb/>to notice that in some cases, as for instance the effective FF, the relativistic correction worsens the agreement with data. <lb/>In Ref. [195] another procedure based on DRs to perform analytic continuation of FFs (as defined in Eq. (131)) was <lb/>suggested. This procedure consists in defining the functions  F  [. . . ;  r] as Laplace transforms of the FF spectral functions, <lb/>that can be parametrized in terms of a series of monopoles, representing the resonant contributions to the FFs (as in VMD <lb/>models). <lb/>The fact that such procedures have no free parameters represents a limitation, from the phenomenological point of view, <lb/>because it prevents the possibility to use the data to gain more information about nucleon structure. On the other hand, the <lb/>accuracy of the predictions measures of the goodness the initial hypothesis. The only degrees of freedom, that could be used <lb/>to stabilize and adjust the TL continuation to the data, are those concerning the fit to the values of profiles which are only <lb/>numerically known in limited r regions. Furthermore, more reliable boosting procedures should be implemented, being the <lb/>asymptotic behavior a key feature of FFs. <lb/> 5.6. Relativistic constituent quark models <lb/> A microscopic description of nucleon FFs in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom, can be achieved in the <lb/>framework of non-relativistic and relativistic constituent quark models (CQM). The concept of constituent quark simplifies <lb/>more complicated objects, that could be depicted as clusters of quarks, antiquarks and gluons. However, at energies where <lb/>QCD is non-perturbative, such intricate clusters are assumed to be efficiently described by constituent quarks. For instance, <lb/>a nucleon at rest is represented as a state of three constituent quarks bounded in a gluonic confining potential, whose wave <lb/>function contains spin-flavor as well as color quantum numbers. <lb/>This realization of non-perturbative QCD, even in its simpler, non-relativistic, formulation, has been quite successful in <lb/>describing and predicting static properties, excited states, and also electromagnetic FFs of hadrons. For the latter, however, <lb/>especially in the case of nucleons, the constituent masses are so small compared with the energy scale of confinement, that <lb/></body>

Proton effective FF, the solid (dashed line) represents the description from Ref. [193], not including (including) relativistic corrections, respectively. <lb/>Data as in Fig. 10. <lb/> relativistic effects become important and hence have to be accounted for. The most convenient way to define relativistic <lb/>covariant models is the so-called light-front form [196]. It allows to boost wave functions of constituent quarks in an <lb/>interaction-independent way. However generators of rotations do depend on the interaction and hence, some model-<lb/>dependence cannot be avoided in defining states with realistic total angular momenta. <lb/>As already noticed, in CQM the effect of all the QCD degrees of freedom, like those of gluons and quark–antiquark pairs, <lb/>are embedded in the constituent quarks, that play the role of quasi-particles. A method to go beyond this approximation <lb/>and hence to account for non-valence components of hadrons has been proposed and extensively studied in Refs. [197–200]. <lb/>Such a method, which is unique in the landscape of relativistic CQMs, has the advantage to provide a good phenomenological <lb/>description of FFs in both SL and TL regions. In the case of nucleons, the possibility of extending the calculation of FFs in the <lb/>TL region relies in the peculiar microscopic description of quark–photon vertices, that are decomposed in isoscalar and <lb/>isovector components. The non-valence quark–antiquark–photon interaction is represented by a &apos;&apos;dressed&apos;&apos; vertex, that is <lb/>parametrized in terms of VMD. Fig. 34 shows the TL VMD contribution to the proton FF as given in Ref. [197]. It has the <lb/>typical structure of VMD I model, see first expression of Eq. (96) and Fig. 13, where two contributions coexist: a bare or <lb/>direct coupling (left), and a vector meson mediated one (right). In particular, using a simplified notation, the vertex function <lb/></body>

The sum runs over the <lb/>polarizations and the set N I  of allowed intermediate resonances with isospin I. In the light of the result obtained in case of <lb/>pion FF [199,200], 20 isoscalar and isovector vector mesons have been considered in all. However, the only free parameters <lb/>of the vertex function, given in Eq. (132), are the weights D I  and V I  , that have been fitted to the SL data. The parameters of the <lb/>lightest resonances have been fixed to the known values, while those of the heaviest are computed following Refs. [201,202]. <lb/>Figs. 35–38 show the comparison in the SL region between data on the Sachs FFs G <lb/> p,n <lb/>M,E  , in various combinations and with <lb/>opportune normalizations, and their descriptions obtained in Ref. [197] by fitting four free parameters. Once the parameters <lb/>have been fixed, the model allows to predict FFs in the TL region also. As an example, the comparison between data and <lb/>prediction for the effective proton FF normalized to the dipole, is shown in Fig. 39. <lb/>The good agreement with data can be interpreted as a proof that the dynamics of the electromagnetic interaction <lb/>of protons, in the non-perturbative QCD regime, is well reproduced by this relativistic CQM and, in particular, by the <lb/>description of the quark–photon vertex in terms of microscopic VMD. It follows that the disagreement in some energy <lb/>regions, e.g. around q <lb/> 2  =  4.5 GeV <lb/> 2 and q <lb/> 2  =  8.0 GeV <lb/> 2 see Fig. 39, could be due to missing vector-meson contributions. <lb/>This approach, as claimed by the authors [12], provides parametrizations for the FFs that do not fulfill the strict analyticity <lb/>which is required by the theory (see Section 3.2). Then, it is not possible to establish a deeper connection between SL and <lb/>TL region, as well as to study the complex structure of FFs and their asymptotic properties. However, it could be interesting <lb/>to reverse the point of view of this procedure, i.e., to use the TL quantities as input in dispersive procedure, to reconstruct <lb/>the SL behavior. <lb/>As noticed above, the extension of the (R)CQM approach to TL region is not straightforward. Let us mention, for <lb/>completeness, other works based on RCQM, for which however, so far, there has not been any attempt to apply to the <lb/>annihilation channels. <lb/></body>

However, as <lb/>phenomenology seems to suggest too, one can assume that an energy domain exists, where the strong coupling becomes <lb/>almost constant and quark masses are negligible. In such domain QCD can be approximated by conformal theory. The <lb/>additional fifth dimension of AdS 5 , the so-called holographic coordinate z, behaves as a scaling variable in the physical <lb/>space–time of QCD, where hadrons live. It can be interpreted as the wavelength at which hadrons are probed, hence, <lb/>small values of z correspond to the ultraviolet region Q  → ∞,  while large values map the infrared region. It follows that <lb/>confinement can be geometrically introduced by imposing the boundary condition z  ≤  1/Λ QCD [210].

For instance, in case of the pion FF, considering also the twist-four term <lb/>(second term in the pion Fock expansion), besides the leading twist-two, m <lb/> 2 <lb/> α  and m <lb/> 2 <lb/> α,2  are identified with the masses of the <lb/> ρ  and  ρ <lb/> ′  vector mesons. <lb/>In case of nucleons, an expression similar to that of Eq. (133) can be used [214], with the additional complication that the <lb/>electromagnetic current is described by two FFs, for instance the Dirac and Pauli FFs F  1 and F  2 , see Eq. (20). In particular <lb/>the mapping of the Dirac FF, responsible for the vector part of the electromagnetic current, is well established [215]. <lb/>Furthermore, in the light-front formalism, at fixed light-front time, the z  − ξ  correspondence is exact, where  ξ  is the <lb/>transverse impact variable [216]. <lb/>Models of gauge-gravity duality do not account for the spin-flavor structures of the nucleons, hence, to compute FFs, <lb/>they have to be included. This is done directly in the Fock space, where each component is weighted following the SU(6) <lb/> spin-flavor symmetry. The resulting Dirac FFs, for the proton and the neutron are [215] <lb/> F <lb/> p <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F  +  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> F <lb/> n <lb/> 1  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = − <lb/> F  +  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) −  F  −  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 3 <lb/> , <lb/> F  ±  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  R <lb/> 4 <lb/>   dz <lb/>z  4  ψ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ±  (z)  V  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  z), <lb/> (135) <lb/>where the fermionic profile  ψ  ±  (z)  corresponds to holographic angular momenta L <lb/> z  =  0 and L <lb/> z  = +1  respectively. <lb/>In the soft-wall model, considering the twist-three expressions of the profiles  ψ  ±  (z)  and the current V  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  z) as given <lb/>in Ref. [215], the functions F  ±  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  coincide with twist-two and twist-three FFs of Eq. (134) for the  ρ  vector meson, i.e., <lb/> F  +  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and F  −  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) =  F <lb/> 3 <lb/> ρ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ).  The Pauli FF, obtained following Ref. [217] using twist-four and twist-five profiles, is: <lb/> F <lb/> p,n <lb/> 2  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = µ  p,n F  −  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ).  These nucleon FF descriptions at leading twist approximation, once the confining potential has been <lb/>chosen, have no free parameters, hence their values represent pure predictions. The first results, reported in Ref. [215] and <lb/>references therein, appear promising. <lb/>Moreover, the simple analytic forms that can be obtained are well suitable to be continued also in the TL region. The <lb/>procedure used in Ref. [215] consists in moving the poles away from the real axis by adding negative imaginary parts, <lb/>depending on the physical widths of the vector meson resonances (see Section 5.1.2). In case of pion FF a very good TL <lb/>description has been obtained in Ref. [215] including also a twist-four contribution with free relative weight and resonance <lb/>widths. No attempts have been done with TL nucleon FFs, yet. <lb/> 5.8. On the physical meaning of form factors in time-like region <lb/> The physical meaning of FFs in SL region is explicit in the Breit frame (Fourier transform of the charge and magnetic <lb/>distributions). In TL region, FFs are complex quantities, depending on q <lb/> 2 . In the classical paper [29], this question has already <lb/>arisen: &apos;&apos;Whereas in the space-like experiments the form factors are given the physical interpretation of the Fourier transforms <lb/>of the spatial charge and magnetic structure of the proton, the TL momentum transfers yield information about the frequency <lb/>structure of the proton. For q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &lt;  0 the &apos;&apos;cloud&apos;&apos; around the proton could have various kinds of resonance structure. . . &apos;&apos;. <lb/>More recently, in Ref. [218], a qualitative model which can be applied both to proton and neutron to describe the data <lb/>from scattering (SL), and annihilation (TL) processes, in particular the different Q <lb/> 2 behavior of electric and magnetic FFs, <lb/>has been proposed. In this model, the expression of the magnetic FF G M  is obtained by applying the quark counting rules <lb/>to the vector part of the electromagnetic field, while the electric FF G E  , given by the scalar part of the electromagnetic field, <lb/>undergoes an additional suppression with respect to G M  , due to the assumption that the strong gluonic field makes the <lb/>central region of the nucleon electrically neutral. The formalism is derived in the Breit frame for SL region and in the center <lb/>of mass system (CMS) for the TL region. FFs are expressed as function of q <lb/> 2  = −Q <lb/> 2 , which is an invariant. <lb/></body>

			<body> 5.8.1. Generalized form factors <lb/> FFs are functions of q <lb/> 2 only, therefore it is possible to define a relativistic invariant in the following way: <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>  <lb/> D <lb/> d <lb/> 4  xe <lb/> iq  µ  x  µ ρ(x), <lb/> q  µ  x <lb/> µ  =  q  0  t  −  q  ·  x <lb/> (136) <lb/>where  ρ(x) = ρ(x,  t) can be understood as the SL distribution of the electric charge in a space–time volume  D. <lb/> In the scattering channel, e  +  p  →  e  +  p and in the Breit frame, we recover the usual definition of FFs: <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = δ(q  0  )F (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> Q <lb/> 2  = −(q <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) &gt;  0. <lb/>(137) <lb/>where zero energy transfer is implied. In the annihilation channel, we have: <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>  <lb/> D <lb/> dte <lb/> i <lb/> √ <lb/> q  2  t <lb/>  <lb/> d <lb/> 3  ⃗  rρ(⃗ r, t)  = <lb/>  <lb/> D <lb/> dte <lb/> i <lb/> √ <lb/> q  2  t  Q(t), <lb/> (138) <lb/>where  Q(t)  describes the time evolution of the charge distribution in the domain  D. <lb/> The scattering region <lb/> The model, considered in Ref. [218], leaves unchanged the prediction for the magnetic FF based on the quark counting <lb/>rules which applies to the vector part of the electromagnetic potential, and derived from the interaction of the virtual photon <lb/>with the three independent quarks. In the SL region, the corresponding behavior of FFs is [35,36]: <lb/> G E  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> SL  =  G D  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>  <lb/> 1  +  Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /(0.71  GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>   −2  , <lb/> G M  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> SL  = µ  p G D  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> (139) <lb/>where Q <lb/> 2 is expressed in GeV <lb/> 2 and FFs are normalized respectively as G E  (0) =  1, G M  (0) = µ  p  . <lb/>The general understanding of the proton structure is of a system of three valence quarks and of a neutral sea consisting <lb/>of gluons and quark–antiquark pairs. It is assumed that the nucleon is an antisymmetric state of colored quarks, that one <lb/>can write formally as (i, j, k are the color index): <lb/> |p⟩ ∼ ϵ  ijk  |u <lb/> i u <lb/> j d <lb/> k  ⟩, <lb/>|n⟩ ∼ ϵ  ijk  |u <lb/> i d <lb/> j d <lb/> k  ⟩. <lb/> (140) <lb/>The idea of this model is that the spatial center of the nucleon (proton and neutron) is electrically neutral, therefore <lb/>the description of Eq. (140) does not apply, starting at some value of Q or for distances smaller than some radius: such <lb/>representation fails inside the nucleon where the region of a strong gluonic field may create a gluonic condensate of clusters <lb/>with a randomly oriented chromo-magnetic field [219]. The mean square value of the intensity of the gluon field in the <lb/>vacuum (G refers to the gluon field tensor G  µν  ) is <lb/> ⟨0| <lb/> α  s <lb/> π <lb/>(G <lb/> a <lb/> µν ) <lb/> 2  |0⟩ = <lb/> α  s <lb/> π <lb/> G <lb/> 2  =  0.012 GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> Taking  α  s  /π ∼  0.1, and neglecting the chromo-magnetic field, one can find that the strength of the chromo-electric field, <lb/> E, is: <lb/> G <lb/> 2  =  2(E <lb/> 2  −  B <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ∼  E <lb/> 2  ≃  0.012 <lb/> α  s <lb/> 2π <lb/>GeV <lb/> 4  =⇒  E  ≃  0.245 GeV <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (141) <lb/>At very small distances the gluonic field as well as the number of gluons increase. Therefore, the strength of the chromo-<lb/>electric field increases too. The main assumption of this model consists in the statement that in the region of strong field <lb/>the color quantum number of quarks does not play any role, due to stochastic averaging. This property can be expressed in the <lb/>following way: <lb/> ⟨G|u <lb/> i u <lb/> j  |G⟩ ∼ δ  ij  . <lb/> (142) <lb/>For the neutron, the same property applies, where the u quark is replaced by the d quark. When the color quantum number <lb/>of quarks of the same flavor vanishes, then, due to Pauli principle, uu (or dd) quarks are pushed outside the internal region of <lb/>the proton (or the neutron). The third quark is attracted by one of the identical quarks and forms a compact diquark. In the <lb/>regions of not so intense gluonic field the color state of quarks is restored. The creation of a quark–diquark dipole system <lb/>occurs when the attraction force exceeds the stochastic force of the gluon field: <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> q e <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 <lb/> &gt;  eQ q E, <lb/> (143) <lb/></body>

			<body> where Q q  is the charge of the isolated quark u (d in case of neutron) and r  0 is the distance between the quark and the diquark <lb/>system. Reminding the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the relation between conjugated variables: r  0  p  0  =  1 (assuming <lb/> ¯ <lb/> h  =  c  =  1), one obtains for the proton: <lb/> p  0  = <lb/>  <lb/> E <lb/>Q q e <lb/> =  1.1 GeV. <lb/>(144) <lb/>The minimal distance where the quark–diquark picture appears is r  0  =  0.22 (0.31) fm in the proton (neutron), which <lb/>corresponds to p <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  =  1.21(2.43) GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>An additional suppression mechanism of the electric FF to the magnetic FF is provided by the colorless internal region of <lb/>the nucleon. A similar effect to the screening of a charge in plasma may take place. The scalar part of the electromagnetic <lb/>field  φ  obeys to the equation: <lb/> ∆φ  = −4π  e <lb/>  <lb/> Z i n i  , <lb/> n i  =  n i0  exp <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> Z i eφ <lb/>kT <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (145) <lb/>where Z i  (n  i  ) are the charges (density) of current q¯ q pairs in the zero charge region, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the <lb/>effective temperature of the hot plasma. Expanding the Boltzmann exponent and using the neutrality condition <lb/>  <lb/> Z i n i0  =  0, <lb/>one obtains: <lb/> ∆φ  − χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ =  0, <lb/> φ = <lb/> e <lb/> −χ  r <lb/> r <lb/> , <lb/>χ <lb/> 2  = <lb/> 4π e <lb/> 2  Z <lb/> 2 <lb/> i n i0 <lb/> kT <lb/> . <lb/> (146) <lb/>The distribution in momentum space, applying the Fourier transform (Table 1), shows that the central region provides an <lb/>additional suppression for the electric FF: <lb/> G <lb/> SL <lb/>E  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/> G <lb/> SL <lb/>M  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/>µ <lb/>  <lb/> 1  +  Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /q <lb/> 2 <lb/>1 <lb/>   −1  , <lb/> (147) <lb/>where q  1  (≡ χ )  should be considered a fitting parameter, which is different, in principle, for proton and neutron. This gives <lb/>a monopole decreasing for the FF ratio, G E  /G  M  in SL region. <lb/> The annihilation channel <lb/> Following similar assumptions, the mechanism of  ¯ <lb/> pp creation in e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  annihilation through a spin one intermediate state <lb/> 3  S  1  = ⟨0|J <lb/> µ  |p¯  p⟩ can be described in three steps: <lb/>1. The vacuum state transfers all the energy released by the electron–positron annihilation to an S-wave state with total <lb/>spin 1 and four momentum q  = ( <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  ,  0, 0, 0). This state of matter consists in at least six massless valence current <lb/>quarks, a set of gluons and a sea of q¯ q current quarks, with total energy q  0  &gt;  2M, and total orbital momentum equal <lb/>to unity. Such state is created in a small spatial volume <lb/>  <lb/> ¯ <lb/> h/ <lb/>  <lb/> q  2 <lb/>   3 <lb/> =  [  ¯ <lb/> h/(2M)] <lb/> 3  ∼  10 <lb/> −3  fm <lb/> 3 . At this point the system <lb/>consists in a pair of (colorless) proton and antiproton each formed by three bare quarks (antiquarks). In agreement with <lb/>parton picture, the quarks as partons have no structure. Therefore the Pauli FF vanishes and the Dirac FF is unity. It is <lb/>then expected that  |G  E  | = |G  M  | =  1. The anomalous magnetic moment appears when the system starts to expand and <lb/>cool down. The current quarks (antiquarks) absorb gluons and transform into constituent quarks (antiquarks). <lb/>2. The next step is the evolution of the point-like (colorless) proton and antiproton creation, that has the size  ¯ <lb/> h/(2M)  ∼ <lb/> 0.1 fm. The residual energy turns into kinetic energy of motion, with relative velocity 2β  =  2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  −  4M 2 <lb/> p  /q <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 . The neutral <lb/>plasma acts on the distribution of the electric charge (not of the magnetic charge) as an additional suppression factor. <lb/>Similarly and for the same reasons as in SL region, see Eq. (147), also in TL region (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> &gt;  4M <lb/> 2 ) a suppression of the electric <lb/>FF is expected: <lb/> |G <lb/> TL <lb/>M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| = <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + (q <lb/> 2  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> )/q <lb/> 2 <lb/>2 <lb/>   −2  θ (q <lb/> 2  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> P  ), <lb/> (148) <lb/> |G <lb/> TL <lb/>E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| = |G <lb/> TL <lb/>M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )| <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + (q <lb/> 2  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> )/q <lb/> 2 <lb/>1 <lb/>   −1  θ (q <lb/> 2  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> P  ). <lb/> (149) <lb/>The Heaviside function  θ (q <lb/> 2  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  avoids poles in the unphysical region. Q <lb/> 2 is replaced by q <lb/> 2  −  4M <lb/> 2 <lb/> P  in order to have <lb/>the implicit normalization  |G  E  | = |G  M  | =  1 at the kinematical threshold. <lb/>3. In the last stage, the long range color forces create a stable colorless state of proton and antiproton. Part of the initial <lb/>energy is dissipated into the transmission of current valence quarks and antiquarks to the constituent ones, which give <lb/>origin to on-shell proton and antiproton. At this stage of evolution, the two sets of quarks and antiquarks are separated <lb/>by a distance R. The repulsion of proton and antiproton which tend to move in opposite directions, with kinetic energy <lb/> T  = <lb/>  <lb/> q  2  −  2M  p c <lb/> 2 , is balanced by the confinement potential q  0  −  2M  p c <lb/> 2  = (k/2)R <lb/> 2 . For extreme small values of the <lb/>velocity,  απ /β ≃  1, the final state interaction leads to the formation of a N  ¯ <lb/> N bound state, with size of the order of 100 fm. <lb/></body>

The spin unity of the intermediate virtual photons should manifest itself in dynamical polarizations of proton <lb/>and antiproton. <lb/> 5.8.2. Comparison with existing data <lb/> Data for TL G  eff (various symbols) and, SL G M  (blue, solid circles) and G E  (unpolarized: red triangles, polarized: green stars) <lb/>together with the predictions of the model presented here are shown in Fig. 40. <lb/>The data on G  eff (in TL) are well reproduced by the model following Eq. (148) with q <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  =  1.2 GeV <lb/> 2 (black line). In SL <lb/>region, as expected, the model reproduces the magnetic FF (triple dot-dashed line) and follows the trend of the polarized <lb/>data (green, dotted line). The dashed area shows the region of non-applicability of the model. Further comparison of this <lb/>model with the existing data is given in Ref. [218], where one can see that this model is also in excellent agreement with <lb/>the behavior of the proton FF ratio measured by the GEp collaboration. This behavior cannot be reproduced by the pQCD <lb/>parametrization which predicts proton FF ratio equal to one. <lb/>This model suggests simple analytic formulas which can reproduce all the available data on the proton and neutron <lb/>FFs. Moreover, the model is in agreement with a point like nature of TL FFs at threshold [34]. In this frame, the precise <lb/>measurement of FFs, in particular near-threshold, contains information on the QCD vacuum structure. This model can be <lb/>considered as a first visualization of a general picture of hadron structure in SL and TL regions, starting from moderate <lb/>momentum transfer values. <lb/> 6. Beyond the Born approximation: interplay between reaction mechanisms and nucleon structure <lb/> The dependence of FFs, extracted from experimental observables, on the reaction mechanism, in particular the effect of <lb/>radiative corrections and of two-photon exchange contributions, is discussed here. Not that we limit our considerations in <lb/>a kinematical region where W and Z boson exchanges can be safely neglected. <lb/>As shown in Section 2, the extraction of the physical information on the internal structure of the proton relies: <lb/> •  in SL region on the  ϵ  linearity of the reduced cross section at fixed Q <lb/> 2 and on the proportionality between P L  /P  T  and the <lb/>FFs ratio in ep elastic scattering; <lb/> •  in TL region, on the cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  linearity of the differential cross section for  ¯ <lb/> pp  ↔  e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  . <lb/>These properties strictly hold at the lowest order of perturbation theory. When a second photon is emitted or exchanged <lb/>inducing virtuality in the proton state, the reaction amplitudes depend, in principle, on a second kinematical variable and <lb/>the expressions of the observables in terms of FFs become more complicated. The calculations differ, according to the model <lb/>used for the description of the hadron structure. <lb/>Any charged particle in an external field radiates, therefore QED radiative corrections are specific and should be calculated <lb/>for each reaction involving, in particular, electrons. Radiative corrections change the absolute value of the observables and <lb/>their dependence on the relevant variables. Therefore, before extracting information on the hadron structure, radiative <lb/>corrections should be calculated for each experiment and each kinematical setting as they are peculiar to each reaction <lb/>channel. <lb/>In earlier times, ep elastic scattering experiments were based on one arm detection, or two arms, where the detection of <lb/>the proton was mostly used to reject the background.

			<body> available. Published values of corrections to the unpolarized cross sections were given in terms of a factor  δ,  which mainly <lb/>depends on the &apos;&apos;inelasticity cut&apos;&apos;,  ∆E:  the maximum energy of a photon which escapes the detection. <lb/>In modern experiments, which involve detection in coincidence, large acceptance detectors, partial integrations on <lb/>kinematical variables, radiative corrections are embedded in the Monte Carlo program which is used for the data analysis, <lb/>and it may be difficult to disentangle their effect from other corrections, as acceptance, efficiency, and suppression of <lb/>background processes. <lb/>Radiative corrections are quantum effects which contribute to experimental observables at higher order of  α.  Usually, <lb/> correction means small modification. The main method for such calculations is a perturbative expansion in the fine structure <lb/>constant  α ≃  1/137. It turns out that the relevant parameter is  α/(2π ) ≃  1.2  ·  10 <lb/> −3  . The smallness of next term <lb/> (α/(2π )) <lb/> 2  ≃  1.3·10 <lb/> −6  should insure a fast convergence. In practice divergences may appear. Other parameters are relevant. <lb/>They may be small as m/E, were m is the electron mass and E its energy, or large as the large logarithm L  =  ln(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ). <lb/> The precision to which radiative corrections should be calculated depends, however, on the precision of the experiment. For <lb/>most experiments, a precision of about 1% is sufficient. However, experiments at e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  colliders, as for example small angle <lb/>Bhabha scattering (at LEP, Novosibirsk, BES), which is used for a precise measurement of the beam energy, require higher <lb/>accuracy. <lb/>It turns out that radiative corrections applied to the unpolarized cross section of some experiments, typically at large <lb/>momentum transfer, may reach 40–50%. They can be even larger in specific kinematical conditions. Therefore, the question <lb/>of the importance of higher orders should be raised. Including higher orders may become extremely complicated, when one <lb/>calculates all the relevant diagrams. However, V. Fadin and E. A. Kuraev suggested a method, based on (lepton) structure <lb/>functions inspired by partons in QCD, which gives the probability to find an electron inside the initial electron, after emission <lb/>of 1, 2,  . . . ,  n photons, at a given energy and angle [220]. The expressions are relatively simple, at least in the leading <lb/>logarithm approximation. <lb/> 6.1. Radiative corrections <lb/>6.1.1. First order radiative corrections <lb/> As mentioned above, expressions for radiative corrections can be very complicated and lengthy and are specific for each <lb/>process. We will give here only the general lines, referring to the relevant publications (for a pedagogical review, see [221]). <lb/>The theory of radiative corrections finds its ground in the work of J. Schwinger, Nobel Laureate in 1965 [222]. He <lb/>introduced radiative corrections in the form of <lb/> dσ  =  dσ  Born  (1 + δ), <lb/> (150) <lb/>where <lb/> δ = −2 <lb/> α <lb/>π <lb/>  <lb/> log <lb/> ϵ  1 <lb/> ∆E <lb/> − <lb/> 13 <lb/>12 <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> 17 <lb/>36 <lb/> + <lb/>  <lb/> log <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  2  −  1 <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> f  (θ  e  ) <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (151) <lb/>with <lb/> f  (θ  e  ) =  log <lb/>  <lb/> sin <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> log <lb/>  <lb/> cos <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> +  Li  2 <lb/>  <lb/> sin <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> (152) <lb/>and Li  2 is the dilogarithm (Spence function). However, when  ∆E  →  0,  δ  becomes negatively infinite, whereas the measured <lb/>cross section is expected to vanish. This is a consequence of neglecting multiple photon emission. The replacement 1  + δ <lb/> by 1  +  e <lb/> δ  suggested by Yennie, Frautschi and Suura [223], is based on the fact that the factorization of multiple soft photon <lb/>emission processes can be done also between different photon contributions. This leads to exponentiate the factor, resulting <lb/>in an effect summed at all orders of perturbation theory. <lb/>The problem of infinities is known from classical electrodynamics, too. Any accelerated, electrically charged particle emits <lb/>radiation. The problems is bypassed, limiting the validity of the classical formulas to a distance of the order of 10 <lb/> −15  m, which <lb/>is assimilated to the &apos;&apos;electron radius&apos;&apos;. <lb/>Usually radiative corrections are decomposed in soft (real and virtual) and hard photon emission, which can be calculated <lb/>separately, analytically and/or numerically. One has to introduce two auxiliary parameters:  λ  a fictitious photon mass, that <lb/>is necessary to regularize infrared singularity and  ∆E,  set by the experiment as the energy boundary for the definition of soft <lb/> and hard photon. This statement is based on the Bloch–Nordsieck theorem [224]: the probability that only a finite number <lb/>of photons escapes the detection is zero. The observed cross section is very close to the cross section where all radiative <lb/>corrections are ignored: &apos;&apos;the total probability of a given change in the motion of the electron is unaffected by the interaction <lb/>with radiation, and the mean number of emitted quanta is infinite in such a way that the mean radiated energy is equal to the <lb/>energy radiated classically in the corresponding trajectory&apos;&apos;. The factorization of the soft photon term is justified by the different <lb/>energy scale of the soft and hard photon emission.

			<body> Fig. 41. Relevant Feynman diagrams for the elastic ep scattering up to the order  α <lb/> 3 . Thick lines represent protons, thin lines electrons, and wavy lines <lb/>photons. From left to right, from top to bottom: real photon emission from incident and final electrons, and from incident and final protons, vacuum <lb/>polarization, vertex corrections, electron self-energy, two-photon exchange (box and crossed diagrams). <lb/> Concerning elastic ep scattering, in the lowest order of perturbation theory,  α <lb/> 3 , the full set of diagrams (see Fig. 41) should <lb/>be taken into account, including their interferences. Two photon exchange enters through its interference with the leading <lb/>(Born) approximation. The approaches of previous papers [51,225,226] were considerably improved by a more recent <lb/>work [227]. The approximations were of mathematical nature, in solving the necessary integrals as well as in simplifications <lb/>related to the physics: <lb/> •  the so-called soft-photon approximations neglect the internal structure of the proton, as well as the possible virtuality; <lb/> •  for the exchange of two photons, only the infrared contribution was calculated, considering one photon soft, and the <lb/>other hard; <lb/> •  the &apos;&apos;peaking approximation&apos;&apos;: assumes that photons are emitted along the direction of the incident or outgoing electron. <lb/>These pioneering works have the merit to give explicit formulas directly applicable to most of single arm experiments, <lb/>pointing out the different sources of enhancement of the cross section. <lb/>In Ref. [227] the soft bremsstrahlung cross section was precisely calculated, according to the method given by &apos;t Hoof <lb/>and Veltman [228] for solving the integrals. For the integrands corresponding to the relevant matrix elements of the box <lb/>diagram, the soft photon approximation was applied to the numerator, only. The proton vertex included FFs and no soft <lb/>photon approximation for the virtual photon was done. The resulting expression in Lab is very compact and the corrections <lb/>were classified, as in the previous papers, according to the power in Z , the charge of the target (Eq. 5.2 of Ref. [227]): <lb/> δ = <lb/> α <lb/>π <lb/>  <lb/> 13 <lb/>6 <lb/>ln <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  2 <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> 28 <lb/>9 <lb/> − <lb/>  <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  2 <lb/>  <lb/> −  1 <lb/>  <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> 4ϵ 1  ϵ  2 <lb/> (2ρ∆E)  2 <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>ln <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ +  Li  2 <lb/>  <lb/> cos <lb/> 2 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> θ <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> 6 <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> 2αZ <lb/> π <lb/>  <lb/> −  ln  ρ  ln <lb/>  <lb/> −q <lb/> 2  x <lb/> (2ρ∆E)  2 <lb/>  <lb/> +  Li  2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> ρ <lb/> x <lb/>  <lb/> −  Li  2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> 1 <lb/> ρx <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> αZ <lb/> 2 <lb/> π <lb/>  ϵ  4 <lb/> |p  4  | <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>ln <lb/> 2  x  −  ln x ln <lb/>  ρ <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  2 <lb/>  <lb/> +  ln x <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/>  ϵ  4 <lb/> |p  4  | <lb/> ln x  −  1 <lb/>  <lb/> ln <lb/>  <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> (2ρ∆E)  2 <lb/>  <lb/> +  1 <lb/> + <lb/> ϵ  4 <lb/> |p  4  | <lb/>  <lb/> −Li  2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> 1 <lb/> x  2 <lb/>  <lb/> +  2Li 2 <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/> x <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> 6 <lb/>  <lb/> + δ <lb/> (1) <lb/> el  ,  x  = <lb/>√ <lb/> 1  + τ + <lb/>√ τ <lb/> √ <lb/> 1  + τ − <lb/>√ τ <lb/>, <lb/> (153) <lb/>where  ρ  is the recoil factor  ρ =  1  + (ϵ  1  /M)(1 −  cos  θ ).

			<body> 6.1.3. Lepton structure function method <lb/> The lepton structure function (LSF) method [229] allows to make a further step beyond the first order radiative <lb/>corrections. Initial and final lepton emission can be taken into account by writing the cross section in form of the cross <lb/>section for the Drell–Yan process, where LSFs play the role of probability distributions [229]. The set of LSFs obeys to the <lb/>renormalization group equations (Lipatov&apos;s equations). Their solutions are well known [220]. The formalism of LSFs allows <lb/>one to obtain the cross section in the so called &apos;&apos;leading logarithmic approximation&apos;&apos; (LLA), i.e., taking correctly into account <lb/>the terms of the order  [(α/π )  ln(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> )] <lb/> n  . This corresponds to collinear kinematics, where the photon is emitted in a <lb/>direction close to the direction of the electron. The dependence of the differential cross section on the angle and the energy <lb/>fraction of the scattered electron y  =  1/ρ, can be written as: <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩdy <lb/> = <lb/>   1 <lb/> z  0 <lb/> dzρ z <lb/> z <lb/>D(z)D <lb/>   yρ z <lb/> z <lb/>  <lb/> Φ  0  (z) <lb/> |1 −  Π(Q  2 <lb/> z  )|  2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + <lb/> α <lb/>π <lb/> K <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (155) <lb/>The K factor is the sum of non leading contributions and the part of the electron emission which does not include LLA. It <lb/>includes also the whole emission of virtual and soft photons by the proton, and the interference of electron and proton soft <lb/>photon emission. The interference between the two virtual photon exchange amplitudes and the Born amplitude should be <lb/>also included as a K factor: this effect is not enhanced by large logarithm (characteristic of LSF) and can be classified among <lb/>the non-leading contributions. <lb/>The non-singlet LSF is written as: <lb/> D(z,  β) = <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + <lb/> 3 <lb/>8 <lb/> β <lb/>  <lb/> (1 −  z) <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> −1 − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> (1 +  z) <lb/>  <lb/> (1 +  O(β))  , <lb/> (156) <lb/> β = <lb/> 2α <lb/> π <lb/>(L −  1), <lb/> Q <lb/> 2  = <lb/> 2ϵ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  (1 −  cos  θ ) <lb/>ρ <lb/>. <lb/> (157) <lb/>The lower limit of integration, z  0 , is related to the &apos;&apos;inelasticity&apos;&apos; cut, c, necessary to select the elastic data: <lb/> z  0  = <lb/> c <lb/> ρ −  c(ρ  −  1) <lb/> . <lb/> (158) <lb/>The z-dependent (z is the variable of integration), kinematically corrected quantities (corrected for the shift in momentum <lb/>due to the photon emission) are obtained from the corresponding ones by replacing the initial electron energy  ϵ  1 by zϵ  1 . <lb/>In an experiment the selection of elastic events requires a cut in the energy spectrum of the scattered electron, and one <lb/>integrates over the events where the energy of the final electron,  ϵ  3 , exceeds a threshold value  ϵ  3  &gt; ϵ  1  y  = ϵ  1  c/ρ, c  &lt;  1. <lb/>Due to the properties of the LSF method, radiative corrections can be written in form of initial and final state emission, <lb/>although gauge invariance is conserved. This form obeys the Lee–Nauenberg–Kinoshita theorem, about the cancellation of <lb/>mass singularities, when integrating on the final energy fraction: it results in omitting the final (fragmentation) LSF, i.e., in <lb/>replacing the term  (ρ  z  /z)D(yρ  z  /z)  (associated with the final electron emission) by unity. <lb/>The relevant observables which are the unpolarized and longitudinally and transverse polarized cross sections,  Φ <lb/> SF <lb/> 0,L,T , <lb/>can be written as: <lb/> Φ <lb/> SF <lb/> 0,L,T  = <lb/>   1 <lb/> z  0 <lb/> dzD(z) <lb/> Φ  0,L,T  (z) <lb/> |1 −  Π(Q  2 <lb/> z  )|  2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + <lb/> α <lb/>π <lb/> K  0,L,T <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (159) <lb/>where the factors K  0,T  ,L  contain the non leading contributions. <lb/>The LSF method allows to write the polarized and unpolarized cross sections in the form of a deviation from the expected <lb/>Born expressions (we omit radiative corrections of higher order): <lb/> Φ <lb/> SF <lb/> 0,L,T  =  Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0,L,T <lb/>  <lb/> 1  +  ∆ <lb/> SF <lb/> 0,L,T  + <lb/> α <lb/>π <lb/> K  0,L,T <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (160) <lb/>with <lb/> ∆ <lb/> SF <lb/> 0,L,T  = <lb/> α <lb/>π <lb/>  <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/>  <lb/> L  − <lb/> 5 <lb/>3 <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> (L −  1) <lb/>  <lb/> 2 ln <lb/>  <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  −  z  0 <lb/>  <lb/> −  z  0  − <lb/> z <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ρ(1 + τ ) <lb/> Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0,L,T <lb/> (L −  1) <lb/>   1 <lb/> z  0 <lb/>   Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0,L,T  (z) <lb/> |1 −  Π(Q  2 <lb/> z  )|  2  − <lb/> Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0,L,T  (1) <lb/> |1 −  Π(Q  2  )|  2 <lb/>  (1 +  z <lb/> 2 <lb/> )dz <lb/> 1  −  z <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (161) <lb/>where  Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0,L,T  (1) =  Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0,L,T and  Φ <lb/> Born <lb/>0 <lb/> =  Φ  0  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)  are the unpolarized, longitudinal, and transverse cross sections in the Born <lb/>approximation. <lb/>The large logarithms which appear in LLA are divergent when m  →  0, however those from virtual corrections cancel <lb/>out the corresponding terms from real radiation (Kinoshita Lee Nauenberg theorem [230,231]). In practice this happens <lb/>for sufficiently inclusive processes, if one cannot distinguish an electron from the accompanying photon in the final state <lb/>(detection in a calorimeter, one arm detection). In the LSF method, this is insured by the property of the non singlet function. <lb/></body>

			<body> 6.2. Two photon exchange <lb/> The previous discussion, as well as the considerations about the Coulomb factor in Section 2.7.2 bring us to the question <lb/>about the limits of the validity of the Born approximation. In QED, each emitted photon reduces the amplitude by a factor <lb/>of  α.  At the lowest order, when one photon is exchanged, the cross section is of the order of  α <lb/> 2 (Born approximation). The <lb/>next term, taking into account the exchange of two photons, is of the order of  α <lb/> 4 , but it contributes to the order  α <lb/> 3 through <lb/>the 1γ  ⊗  2γ interference. <lb/>Therefore, in order that the 2γ -contribution becomes observable, the factor of  α  (at least) should be compensated by <lb/>an enhancement due to a specific reaction mechanism or to specific nuclear effects which may not be calculable in model <lb/>independent way. <lb/>It was observed already in the 70&apos;s that the simple rule of  α-counting  for the estimation of the relative role of two-photon <lb/>contribution to the amplitude of elastic eh-scattering (h is a hadron), may not hold at large momentum transfer [232–235]. <lb/>Using a Glauber approach for the calculation of multiple scattering contributions [236], it was shown that the relative role <lb/>of two-photon exchange can be essentially increased in the region of high momentum transfer. It was also shown that this <lb/>effect has to be even larger for ed-elastic scattering and for heavier nuclei (like d, <lb/> 3 He or <lb/> 4 He), due to the steep decreasing <lb/>of the FFs. The argument for the possible increase of the relative role of two-photon exchange at large momentum transfer <lb/>follows from the fact that this momentum has to be equally shared between the two photons. This effect could then manifest <lb/>at relatively small momentum transfer – of the order of 1 GeV – especially in the region of the diffractive minima. <lb/>In order to evaluate this effect using a simplified expression for a hadron containing n quarks, neglecting the spin <lb/>structure, we introduce the &apos;&apos;generalized&apos;&apos; electromagnetic FF, F n  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  defined as <lb/> F n  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ≃ <lb/>  <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  2 <lb/> x <lb/>   1−n <lb/> , <lb/> (162) <lb/>parametrized according to the counting rules [35,36] which hold in the asymptotic region. Here n is the number of <lb/>constituents (quarks and antiquarks inside the hadron h), and m <lb/> 2 <lb/> x  ≃  0.71 GeV <lb/> 2 (typical value for the nucleon FFs). In case of <lb/> ed-scattering assuming that the momentum transfer is shared between two photons which interact with different nucleons <lb/>in the deuteron, the enhancement would be given by the factor <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/> N <lb/>  <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> /4 <lb/>  <lb/> F d  (Q  2  ) <lb/> = <lb/> 256 <lb/> m  2 <lb/> x <lb/> , <lb/> (163) <lb/>(N stands for the nucleon and d for deuteron) which largely compensates the factor of  α. <lb/> This is the mechanism suggested in Ref. [232], using an analogy with the Glauber theory of multiple scattering. In <lb/>Ref. [232] the two-photon amplitude is purely imaginary, at least at very small scattering angles, so it cannot interfere with <lb/>the one-photon exchange amplitude in the differential cross section of unpolarized particles scattering. However, in this <lb/>case specific polarization observables may be large, in particular T -odd polarization observables. Moreover, the 2γ effect <lb/>would be enhanced in TL region, where the amplitudes are complex functions. <lb/>In case of a large contribution of two-photon exchange, the standard interpretation of electron–hadron scattering in <lb/>terms of structure functions and the elegant formalism which relates the observables to FFs do not hold anymore. This would <lb/>raise doubts on the validity of a large amount of recent experimental results on the hadron properties, whose extraction <lb/>relies on the validity of one-photon exchange. <lb/>The experiments in the 70&apos;s were mainly focused on the difference between electron and positron elastic scattering on <lb/>the proton (for a recent review, see Ref. [237]). The precision of the data does not allow to measure an effect lower than <lb/>a few percent. Note that this is also the size of those radiative corrections which have odd nature. Since that time, the <lb/>precision of the data has extremely improved, however the validity of the one-photon mechanism was not questioned until <lb/>discrepancies appeared in ed elastic scattering from two experimental data sets [20]. Subsequently it was suggested that <lb/>a relative (real and linear in  ϵ)  contribution of 2γ exchange, with size of  ≈6%  of the main (1γ ) term, would reconcile FFs <lb/>extracted from polarized and unpolarized ep elastic scattering data [238]. <lb/>Note that the search of 2γ effects in TL region has the advantage that the information is fully contained in the angular <lb/>distribution (which is equivalent to the charge asymmetry) [239]. In a single measurement, the odd terms corresponding <lb/>to two photon exchange can be canceled or singled out. Two photon exchange effects cancel if one does not measure the <lb/>charge of the outgoing lepton, or in the sum of the cross section at complementary angles, allowing to extract the moduli of <lb/>the FFs [240,31]. In SL region, it is necessary to measure electron and positron scattering in the same kinematical conditions, <lb/>in order to single out the real part of the 1γ  ⊗  2γ interference. <lb/> 6.2.1. Model independent properties of 2γ exchange <lb/> We consider first the one-photon mechanism for e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − →  p  + ¯ <lb/> p. As we stressed, the conservation laws allow only <lb/>one value of the p¯ p total angular momentum  J  and the quantum numbers of the photon  J <lb/> PC  =  1 <lb/> −−  . <lb/>The selection rules with respect to the C and P invariance allow two states for p¯ p (e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  in case of p  + ¯ <lb/> p  →  e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> −  ) <lb/> S  =  1,  ℓ =  0 and S  =  1,  ℓ =  2, with:  J <lb/> P  =  1 <lb/> − <lb/> , <lb/> (164) <lb/>where S is the total spin and  ℓ  is the orbital angular momentum of the  ¯ <lb/> pp system. <lb/></body>

			<body> We have shown in Appendix C.1 that the  θ  dependence of the cross section for e <lb/> +  +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p, in the one-photon <lb/>exchange mechanism must have the following general form: <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/> (e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p)  ≃  A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) +  B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ , <lb/> (165) <lb/>where A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are well definite quadratic contributions of  |G  E  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )|  and  |G  M  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )|,  with A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  and B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ≥  0 for <lb/> q <lb/> 2  ≥  4M <lb/> 2 . <lb/>Similarly, let us consider the cos  θ  dependence of the 1γ  ⊗  2γ interference contribution to the differential cross section <lb/>of e <lb/> + +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p. The spin and parity of the 2γ -states, in general, is not fixed, however only positive values of C -parity, <lb/> C  (2γ ) = +1,  are allowed. An infinite number of states with different quantum numbers can contribute and their relative <lb/>role is determined by the dynamics of the process  γ <lb/>  *  + γ <lb/>  *  → ¯ <lb/> p  +  p, with both virtual photons. But the cos  θ  dependence of <lb/>the 1γ  ⊗  2γ interference contribution to the differential cross section can be predicted on the basis of its C -odd nature: the <lb/> ¯ <lb/> pp-system, produced through 1γ and 2γ exchanges, has different values of C -parity. Therefore the 1γ  ⊗  2γ interference <lb/>contribution must be an odd function of cos  θ  : <lb/>Re <lb/>  <lb/> M  1  M <lb/>  * <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> =  cos  θ (a  0  +  a  2 cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ + · · · ), <lb/> (166) <lb/>where a i  (t),  i  =  0, 2,  . . . ,  are real coefficients, functions of t only. This odd cos  θ  dependence is essentially different from <lb/>that of the cross section for the one-photon approximation, which is, indeed, even in cos  θ  . <lb/>In terms of invariants, defined in Section 2.7, one can write the modulus of the matrix element as a series of Legendre <lb/>polynomials P  λ (cos θ ),  i.e. <lb/> |M| = <lb/>  <lb/> λ <lb/> A  λ (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )P λ (cos θ ), <lb/> (167) <lb/>where the functions A  λ  are the sum of interference terms between amplitudes corresponding to n  1  γ  and n  2  γ  . The invariance <lb/>for charge conjugation of the electromagnetic interaction requires that <lb/> (−1) <lb/> λ  = (−1) <lb/> n  1  +n  2  . <lb/> Let us rewrite the relation between the CMS angle of emission of the proton in e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  annihilation,  θ  , and the lab electron <lb/>scattering angle  θ  e  in ep elastic scattering in terms of the invariant variables s and t (which act in different kinematical <lb/>region): <lb/>cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ ≡  1  + <lb/> st  + (s −  M <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> t <lb/>   t <lb/> 4 <lb/> −  M  2 <lb/>  ≡  1  + <lb/> cot <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ  e  /2) <lb/> 1  + τ <lb/>. <lb/> This correspondence between cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  , in the annihilation channel, and cot <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ  e  /2),  in the scattering channel, explains the <lb/>origin of the linear cot <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ  e  /2)  (or  ϵ)  dependence of the differential cross section for the ep-process and the linear cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ <lb/> dependence in the annihilation channels, which results from the one-photon mechanism. Charge conjugation introduces <lb/>odd terms, destroying such a linearity. <lb/>Explicitly, the cross section for e <lb/> ±  p scattering can be written in presence of 2γ exchange as [18]: <lb/> dσ  =  dσ  Mott <lb/>  <lb/> ˜ <lb/> A(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) + ˜ <lb/> B(q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  tan <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/> ±  C  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  tan <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  + τ <lb/> cot <lb/> 2  θ  e <lb/> 2 <lb/>   1/2 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> The terms  <lb/>  and  <lb/>  contain corrections of the order of  α <lb/> 2 with respect to the corresponding coefficients in 1γ approximation, <lb/>and C is proportional to the interference term. Therefore, it carries a different sign for e <lb/> +  p and e <lb/> −  p scattering. <lb/> Spin structure of the matrix elements in presence of 2γ terms <lb/> The spin structure of the matrix element can be established in analogy with elastic np-scattering, using the general <lb/>properties of the electron–hadron interaction, such as the P-invariance and the relativistic invariance. Taking into account <lb/>the identity of the initial and final states and the T -invariance of the electromagnetic interaction, the processes e <lb/> ∓  N  →  e <lb/> ∓  N, <lb/> which involve four spin 1/2 particles, are characterized by six independent products of four-spinors, describing the initial <lb/>and final fermions, see Table 4. The corresponding (model independent) parametrization of the matrix element can be done <lb/>in many different but equivalent forms, in terms of six invariant complex amplitudes,  A  i  (s,  Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  i  =  1, 2,  . . . ,  6, which <lb/>are functions of two independent variables, s and Q <lb/> 2 , or  ϵ  and Q <lb/> 2 . This number can be reduced to three, imposing helicity <lb/>conservation. <lb/>The general structure of the matrix element for eN elastic scattering, that can be written for the 1γ  ⊗  2γ exchange <lb/>mechanism is [241]: <lb/> M <lb/> (∓)  = <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> Q  2 <lb/>  <lb/> u(k  2  )γ µ  u(k  1  )u(p  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> γ µ  F <lb/> (∓) <lb/> 1  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) + <lb/> σ µν  q  ν <lb/> 2M <lb/> F <lb/> (∓) <lb/> 2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) <lb/>  <lb/> u(p  1  ) <lb/> +  u(k  2  )γ µ γ  5  u(k  1  )u(p  2  )γ µ γ  5  u(p  1  )A <lb/> (∓) <lb/> (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (168) <lb/></body>

Note, however, that Eq. <lb/>(168) is one of the many equivalent representations of the matrix element for e <lb/> ∓  N elastic scattering. <lb/>The C -invariance and the crossing symmetry of the eN-interaction allows us to write (in the 1γ  ⊗  2γ approximation) <lb/>[242,243]: <lb/> F <lb/> (∓) <lb/> 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) = ∓F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) +  ∆F <lb/> (∓) <lb/> 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ), <lb/> ∆F <lb/> (−) <lb/> 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) =  ∆F <lb/> (+) <lb/> 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) ≡  ∆F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ), <lb/> (169) <lb/> A <lb/> (−) <lb/> (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) =  A <lb/> (+) <lb/> (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) ≡  A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ), <lb/> where F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are the Dirac and Pauli nucleon electromagnetic FFs, that are real function of one variable, Q <lb/> 2 , only (in the SL <lb/>region of momentum transfer square). It follows from Eq. (169), that both elastic processes, e <lb/> ∓ +  N  →  e <lb/> ∓ +  N, that involve <lb/>in total six complex amplitudes, F <lb/> (∓) <lb/> 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ),  A <lb/> (∓) <lb/> (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)  can be described by eight different real functions: <lb/> F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ), <lb/> Re[∆F 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)], <lb/> Re[A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)], <lb/> Im[∆F 1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)], <lb/> Im[A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)]. <lb/> The order of magnitude of these quantities is <lb/> ∆F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ),  A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ) ≃ α ≃ <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4π <lb/> ≃ <lb/> 1 <lb/>137 <lb/> , <lb/> F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) ≃ α <lb/> 0  =  1. <lb/>(170) <lb/>It is important to stress that the main contributions, F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  are functions of Q <lb/> 2 only. Note that, due to C -invariance and <lb/>crossing symmetry, the  ϵ  dependence of the other six functions occurs through the specific argument, <lb/> x  = <lb/>  <lb/> 1  + ϵ <lb/> 1  − ϵ <lb/>, <lb/> (171) <lb/>with the following symmetry properties, with respect to the change x  → −x  [242,243]: <lb/> ∆F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , −x) = −∆F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  x), <lb/> (172) <lb/> A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , −x) = +A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  x). <lb/> (173) <lb/>The functions,  ∆F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)  and  A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)  describe the 2γ contribution to the matrix element. Having an axial–vector <lb/>structure (γ  µ γ  5 ), the corresponding contribution to the matrix element, characterized by the complex amplitude  A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ), <lb/> cannot be identified with the nucleon axial FF, f A  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  that is a real function of Q <lb/> 2 , only. In principle, it can be defined again <lb/>as a &apos;&apos;generalized&apos;&apos; axial FF, but this will be source of confusion. The amplitude  A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)  describes only a part of the 2γ <lb/>contribution, its spin structure corresponds to C  = +1  exchange in the t channel, with definite symmetry properties with <lb/>respect to x  → −x  transformation, see Eq. (173). <lb/>In this framework, the simple and transparent phenomenology of electron–hadron physics does not hold anymore, and <lb/>in particular, in electron scattering experiments it makes very difficult to extract information on the internal structure of a <lb/>hadron in terms of electromagnetic FFs, which are real functions of one variable. <lb/>The reactions e <lb/> ∓ +  N  →  e <lb/> ∓ +  N are therefore described by eight different real quantities: <lb/> •  two real FFs F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  which are functions of one variable, only; <lb/> •  three functions:  ∆F  1,2  (Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ)  and  A(Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , ϵ),  which are, generally, complex functions of two variables, Q <lb/> 2 and  ϵ. <lb/> It can be shown that it is still possible i principle to extract the real electromagnetic FFs, even in presence of 2γ exchange, <lb/>but at the price of measuring a number of polarization observable (three time-odd or five time-even combinations) including <lb/>double spin, expected to be of the order of  α  (see Appendix E). <lb/> 6.2.2. Experimental search of two-photon exchange contribution <lb/> The experiments suggested above, can be in principle realized at e <lb/> ±  rings, (HERA and VEPP-3), with a polarized proton <lb/>jet target. Presently, many efforts are devoted to precise measurements of the difference between unpolarized e <lb/> ±  p elastic <lb/>scattering at Novosibirsk [244], JLab/CLAS [245] and DESY [246]. <lb/>In the Novosibirsk experiment data were collected at two beam energies 1 and 1.6 GeV, for different angles. The electron <lb/>(positron) and the proton were detected in coincidence. The accessible Q <lb/> 2 values do not exceed 1.5 GeV <lb/> 2 . Scattering at <lb/>small angles insured luminosity monitoring.

			<body> positrons, time instability of detection efficiency, and drift of the target thickness. Moreover, specific effort has been devoted <lb/>to the calculation of QED radiative correction, with a new precise first order calculation and a dedicated Monte Carlo <lb/>program [247]. The available preliminary data [248] show that the largest contribution to the charge asymmetry is given by <lb/>QED odd corrections. The ratio does not exceed 1.03, and does not show a increasing trend with Q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>At the moment of writing this section, no data are publicly available, although the data taking is completed for the other <lb/>two experiments. The CLAS experiment uses the primary JLab electron beam at 5.5 GeV and  ≃  100 nA converted in a radiator <lb/>to produce photons. Photons are subsequently converted in e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  -pairs of energies up to 4 GeV, are magnetically separated <lb/>and hit the target. The scattered e <lb/> ±  and protons are detected in CLAS. This experiment covers the range 0.1  ≤ ϵ ≤  1 and <lb/>0.5  ≤  Q <lb/> 2  ≤  2.5 GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The Olympus experiment uses the large acceptance spectrometer MIT-BLAST which has been installed at the DORIS <lb/>preinjector of DESY, using 2 GeV e <lb/> ±  beams. The measurement has been done for Q <lb/> 2  ≤  2.2 GeV <lb/> 2 , in the range 0.3  ≤ ϵ ≤  0.9. <lb/>The expected precision on the ratio is  ≃  1%. <lb/>Polarization experiments are in principle more sensitive to the interference of amplitudes. The single-spin asymmetry A T <lb/> in the scattering of transversely polarized electrons on unpolarized protons is proportional to the 2γ term and suppressed <lb/>by the small factor (m/M). To calculate this asymmetry it is necessary to take into account also the small amplitudes which <lb/>are proportional to the electron mass (the so-called helicity flip amplitudes). Measurements of this asymmetry give values <lb/>different from zero, contrary to what is expected in the Born approximation. At Q <lb/> 2  =  0.1 GeV <lb/> 2 and large scattering angles, <lb/>in Ref. [249] it was found a non-zero value of A T  = −15.4 ±  5.4 ppm. In Ref. [250], small but non zero values were found at <lb/>Q <lb/> 2  =  0.106 GeV <lb/> 2 , A T  = (−8.59 ±  0.89 stat  ±  0.75 sys  ) ×  10 <lb/> 6 and at Q <lb/> 2  =  0.230 GeV <lb/> 2 , A T  = (−8.52 ±  2.31 stat  ±  0.87 sys  ) ×  10 <lb/> 6 . <lb/>One experiment was dedicated to the measurement of the vector deuteron polarization, P y  , in unpolarized ed-elastic <lb/> scattering, at q  =  3.65 fm <lb/> −1  [251]. The result was P y  =  0.075  ±  0.088. <lb/>The GEp collaboration at JLab [252] has measured the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse recoil proton polarization, <lb/> P z  /P  x  , in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons on a proton target for different values of  ϵ  at Q <lb/> 2  =  2.49 GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The result confirmed that this ratio is constant within 1%, as expected from 1γ exchange, see Fig. 46. Few measurements of <lb/>individual recoil polarization P z  and, with lower precision, P x  exist. In Ref. [252], a few percent deviation of the experimental <lb/>value of P z  from Born expectation has been pointed out. We should note that the polarization data are not corrected for <lb/>radiation emission. This is justified in the ratio, as at first order radiative corrections cancel, but they are expected to be of <lb/>the same order of the unpolarized cross section for the individual polarized cross sections [253]. <lb/>One should also note that no experimental evidence of 2γ exchange (more exactly, of the real part of the <lb/>1γ  ⊗  2γ interference) has been found in the experimental data, searching for non linearities in the Rosenbluth plots for <lb/>electron elastic scattering on particles with spin zero [254] and one half [71,255]. In case of deuteron, the analysis of Ref. [20] <lb/>concluded in a more probable systematic error in one of the experiments, because the discrepancy did not show evidence of <lb/>increasing with Q <lb/> 2 , as expected from 2γ -mechanism. All experiments based on the Rosenbluth separation, the most recent <lb/>being reported in Ref. [56], show a linear  ϵ-dependence  of the cross section. <lb/>As pointed out above, in TL region a forward–backward asymmetry in the angular distribution for the reactions e <lb/> + +e <lb/> − ↔ <lb/>¯ <lb/> p  +  p is a possible indication for a 2γ -contribution. Only recently, such angular distribution has been measured by the BaBar <lb/>collaboration, using ISR. A first analysis on the BaBar data [9] does not show evidence of asymmetry within 2%, which is in <lb/>the limit of the uncertainty of the data [256]. Such conclusion has been confirmed by an analysis of the full statistics [88], <lb/>where the forward–backward integral asymmetry was found consistent with zero A y  = −0.025 ±  0.014  ±  0.003, slightly <lb/>depending on the invariant mass cuts. <lb/>In TL region new, precise data are expected at BES III [257] in the near threshold region, and from PANDA (FAIR). <lb/>Simulations show that PANDA will be sensitive to asymmetries larger than 5% in a wide region of momentum transfers [89]. <lb/>In parallel with the new experiments, different reanalysis of existing experimental data have been focused on the cross <lb/>sections for e <lb/> ±  p scattering, that were measured in the 70&apos;s concluding in no measurable charge asymmetry. Note that instead <lb/>of the charge asymmetry (related to the difference of cross section) for e <lb/> ±  p scattering: <lb/> A <lb/> odd  = <lb/> dσ <lb/> e  −  p  −  dσ <lb/> e  +  p <lb/> 2 dσ  Born  (1 + δ  even  ) <lb/>, <lb/> (174) <lb/>where  δ <lb/> even is the C -even radiative corrections factor, which depends on the inelasticity cut, the results are usually presented <lb/>in terms of the ratio R: <lb/>R  = <lb/> σ (e <lb/> +  p  →  e <lb/> +  p) <lb/> σ (e  −  p  →  e  −  p) <lb/> = <lb/> 1  −  A <lb/> odd <lb/> 1  +  A  odd  , <lb/> (175) <lb/>which enhances the presence of C -odd terms. <lb/>Different reanalyses reach different conclusions, due to the method of treating QED radiative corrections. In the <lb/>experiments, radiative corrections were applied at first order, based on classical papers [226,51]. A recent collection and <lb/>review of the data can be found in Ref. [237]. The data are shown in Fig. 45 as a function of Q <lb/> 2 (left) and  ϵ  (right) and <lb/>cover a wide range of kinematical values, mostly at large  ϵ  and low Q <lb/> 2 . The published R values are also reported in Table 6, <lb/>with the corresponding kinematics and references. In Ref. [237] the raw data were recovered from the published data, <lb/>and radiative corrections were consistently applied, following more recent calculations from Refs. [227,270].

A good compatibility among the data was found on the basis of a point-to-point quantitative analysis. Within <lb/>this analysis, the C -odd soft contribution, arising from the interference between electron and target Bremsstrahlung, gives <lb/>the main contribution to the observed asymmetry. <lb/>In Ref. [271] a reanalysis of a selected sample of the existing data concluded in evidence for 2γ -contribution which would <lb/>suppress the cross section at low  ϵ  and low Q <lb/> 2 . Predictions were done for charge asymmetry measurements, under specific <lb/>assumptions, using a parametrization of the 2γ -contribution as extracted from e <lb/> ±  p data in SL [272] and TL [273] regions. <lb/>Note that in Ref. [265] the backward scattered electron was detected in coincidence with the forward proton. A non-<lb/>negligible background as a function of the inelasticity cut was shown for the high Q <lb/> 2 point, and an improved analysis was <lb/>published later on in Ref. [266], reducing the ratio from R  =  1.085  ±  0.018 to R  =  1.075  ±  0.017 at Q <lb/> 2  =  0.319 GeV <lb/> 2 and <lb/>from R  =  1.180  ±  0.054 to R  =  1.129  ±  0.050 at Q <lb/> 2  =  1.244 GeV <lb/> 2 .

In Ref. [274] the charge asymmetry, defined as the difference of the cross sections for the scattering of electron <lb/>and positron (or  µ  ±  ) on the same target of charge Z , was derived using the eikonal approximation: <lb/> A  = <lb/> dσ <lb/> e  −  Z  −  dσ <lb/> e  +  Z <lb/> dσ e  −  Z  +  dσ e  +  Z  = π  x sin  (θ /2)  cos  φ(x),  x  = <lb/> Z  α <lb/>β <lb/>, <lb/> (176) <lb/>where  β  is the velocity of the initial particle, in the laboratory system. The effect of multiphoton exchange results in a <lb/>correction which can be expressed as a factor cos  φ(x). <lb/> A tentative extrapolation of this formalism to hadron scattering was suggested by the replacing x  =  Z  α →  x c  =  Nα s  . <lb/> In the kinematical conditions when x c  ≫  1, the small angle corrected cross section is expected to have an universal  θ <lb/> dependence as <lb/> dσ <lb/>dσ R <lb/> =  1  ± <lb/> π <lb/> 4 <lb/>sin <lb/>  θ <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> , θ ≪  1, <lb/>(177) <lb/>leading to a corresponding asymmetry of proton and antiproton scattering on the same target nucleus as defined for the <lb/>lepton case [275]. <lb/> 6.2.3. Model dependent calculations corrections <lb/> In Fig. 46 the lines are the results of model calculations which are reviewed in this section. All these calculations include <lb/>2γ -exchange in a way to correct consistently the unpolarized ep scattering data, bringing them in agreement with the <lb/>polarization data, or, at least, decreasing essentially the discrepancy. As it is seen from the figure, introducing  ϵ-dependent <lb/> amplitudes has a non trivial effect on the polarization ratio, and fails to reproduce the data which show a constant behavior <lb/>within 1%. This is not the case for the LSF calculation, which introduces small non-linearities which act as corrections to <lb/> Q <lb/> 2 -dependent amplitudes. <lb/>The problem in calculating the box diagram is related to the intermediate nucleon state: in principle the calculation <lb/>requires the knowledge of the FFs related to all possible nucleon resonances, or a consistent modelization of the nucleon <lb/>structure. <lb/>The elastic nucleon intermediate state contribution in the box diagram was calculated in Ref. [276], using a monopole <lb/>parametrization for the nucleon FF. The results bring partially in agreement the unpolarized data. They predicted that the <lb/>effect of the 2γ -contribution to the transverse (longitudinal) polarization transfer P x  (P  z  )  is small (enhanced at backward <lb/></body>

			<body> angles). The kinematical properties related to fast decreasing FFs were not investigated in detail, as well as the possible <lb/>presence of inelastic contributions in the intermediate state. A possible test of the model dependence of the calculation <lb/>with an exactly solvable QED result is also absent. <lb/>The excitation of the  ∆  resonance was subsequently calculated [280], giving a contribution of the opposite sign with <lb/>respect to the nucleon case. This is consistent with considerations based on the analytic properties of the Compton <lb/>amplitude, which predict large cancellation between elastic and inelastic nucleon intermediate state contributions [281]. <lb/>The authors of Ref. [273] used a generalized parton distribution (GPD) approach, where a partonic &apos;&apos;handbag&apos;&apos; model <lb/>allows to describe the contribution where both photons are hard. The 2γ -amplitude was factorized into a hard sub-process <lb/>(electron–quark scattering) and a soft sub-process, where the intermediate nucleon (including its excited states) is described <lb/>in terms of GPD. Although the same GPD enter in wide angle scattering processes as deep virtual Compton scattering and <lb/>hard exclusive meson production, the data still do not definitely constrain different possible parametrizations for the GPD <lb/>and the kinematical range where such model can be applied has still to be verified. Results were given for a &apos;&apos;gaussian&apos;&apos; and a <lb/>&apos;&apos;modified&apos;&apos; Regge model for GPD. Consistency for the unpolarized data was found, including a specific  ϵ  dependence which <lb/>is however inconsistent with the polarization ratio. <lb/>Quantitatively different results were obtained for the elastic 2γ -contribution in ep scattering in Ref. [282] and for the  ∆ <lb/> contribution in Ref. [283]. This approach is based on DRs: the imaginary part of the amplitude is determined by unitarity, <lb/>and the real part is restored using analytic properties of the amplitude. This method does not require off-shell FFs, as the <lb/>nucleons are on-shell in the intermediate state. The agreement among the data is restored through a correction affecting <lb/>mostly the magnetic FF. <lb/>Another approach was used in Ref. [279], where it was found that the leading 2γ -amplitude is driven by processes <lb/>involving one hard gluon exchange. Using two models for the leading twist nucleon distribution amplitudes, the authors <lb/>found good agreement with the unpolarized data. Similar approach was applied to the TL region, where the 2γ -contribution <lb/>was found smaller. <lb/>In conclusions of this issue, the present calculations of 2γ -mechanism may give a qualitative explanation of the <lb/>discrepancy of the FF ratio, due to the freedom in the model dependence, but they are in quantitative disagreement among <lb/>each other and with respect to polarized data. Further comparison with the models will be soon provided by the results of <lb/>the running experiments on electron and positron scattering on the proton. <lb/> 7. Future perspectives <lb/> 7.1. Space-like region <lb/> MAMI-Mainz (A1 collaboration) will continue to play the leading role in FFs measurements at low Q <lb/> 2 . The experiment <lb/>A1/0112 is planned with a deuterium target, in order to get precise information on the deuteron radius and possibly bring <lb/>new pieces of information on the nucleon radius. <lb/>Further results are expected at Jefferson Laboratory after the energy upgrade. The availability of the future 11 GeV high <lb/>quality electron beam opens an experimental program on all four nucleon FFs with experiments involving the three Halls, A, <lb/>B and C. The Akhiezer–Rekalo method will be applied to extend the precision measurements on the FF ratio, both for proton <lb/>and neutron. <lb/>The ep elastic cross section up to Q <lb/> 2  =  17.5 GeV <lb/> 2 will be measured by the E12-07-108 collaboration in Hall A, making <lb/>use of the two high resolution spectrometers. The large luminosity, up to  L  =  4.3  ·  10 <lb/> 38 cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  will allow to measure the <lb/>cross section and extract the magnetic FF very precisely. Specific effort is done in the control of the systematic errors. <lb/>In Hall A, the proposal JLab/E12-07-109 will extend the measurement of the FF ratio up to Q <lb/> 2  =  15 GeV <lb/> 2 , with the <lb/>polarization method. The polarization of the recoil proton is measured through a secondary scattering, therefore this method <lb/>does not need only a high intensity, highly polarized electron beam, but also large solid angle detection of the scattered <lb/>particles. The 75  µA,  85% polarized electron beam will hit a 40 cm long liquid hydrogen target. For the proton detection, <lb/>drift chambers will be replaced be GEM detectors, which may work in a high background environment. The electron will be <lb/>detected in the large solid angle (∆Ω  =  180 msr) &apos;&apos;BigCal&apos;&apos; lead glass calorimeter. <lb/>Particular effort is devoted to investigate the neutron FF at larger Q <lb/> 2 . <lb/>Measurement of the neutron magnetic FF G <lb/> n <lb/>M  is proposed in Hall A by the E12-09-019 collaboration in nine kinematical <lb/>points in the Q <lb/> 2 range 3.5–18 GeV <lb/> 2 . The systematic errors will be reduced by extracting G <lb/> n <lb/>M  from the ratio of neutron to <lb/>proton in (quasi)-elastic scattering from the deuteron. Nuclear corrections on the deuteron will have to be taken thoroughly <lb/>into account. The experiment E12-07-104, based on the same principle, has been proposed in Hall B with the CLAS detector, <lb/>and foresees similar uncertainties up to Q <lb/> 2  =  13.5 GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>In Hall C E-11-009 propose to extend previous measurements (by the E93-038 collaboration) by measuring the electric <lb/>neutron FF, G <lb/> n <lb/>E  , in the quasi-elastic scattering of a polarized electron beam on an unpolarized deuterium target, by measuring <lb/>the recoil neutron polarization, up to Q <lb/> 2  =  6.88 GeV <lb/> 2 . Similarly to the proton case, the measurement of the ratio of the two <lb/>components of the neutron polarization reduces the systematic uncertainties. Evidently nuclear corrections for the deuteron <lb/>and the inelastic background should be carefully handled. The experiment foresees 23% systematic uncertainties. <lb/>A new polarized <lb/> 3 He target will be built by the E12-09-016 collaboration, based on the well known technique of spin-<lb/>exchange optical pumping, with improvements which allow to stand few times larger luminosity that in the past. This Hall <lb/></body>

			<body> A collaboration, proposes a measurement of the electromagnetic FF ratio of the neutron G <lb/> n <lb/>E  /G <lb/> n <lb/>M  at four Q <lb/> 2 values up to the <lb/>largest value of 10.2 GeV <lb/> 2 in the semi-exclusive <lb/> 3  ⃗ <lb/> He(⃗ e, en)pp scattering in quasi elastic kinematics, through the asymmetry <lb/>ratio. The announced error on the ratio is of the order of 20%. <lb/> 7.2. Time-like region <lb/> In the TL region the precision of the data is not comparable to SL region, due to the limited luminosity reached at  ¯ <lb/> pp or <lb/> e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  colliders. <lb/>The individual determination of the proton FFs has not yet been done. Therefore FF data, in this region, have to be <lb/>understood as &apos;&apos;generalized FF&apos;&apos;, a quantity which is proportional to the cross section. <lb/>About the neutron TL FF, the four points measured at FENICE, if confirmed, are twice as large as the proton TL FF at the <lb/>corresponding q <lb/> 2 value, which in turn, are twice larger than the SL values at the same  |q <lb/> 2  |.  This behavior, very difficult to be <lb/>understood, can be reproduced by VMD based fits. A qualitative interpretation has been given in Ref. [284], assuming that <lb/>a single isovector intermediate state dominates in both crossed  ¯ <lb/> pp  ↔  e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  channels, which is based on the experimental <lb/>fact that multipion states with odd number of pions dominate in the near threshold cross section. <lb/>The TL extension of the coupling constant  α  s  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  has been analyzed with respect to this issue. It was shown in Ref. [285], <lb/>that the analytic prolongation ln q <lb/> 2  →  ln q <lb/> 2  ±  iπ introduces a phase factor and interference effects <lb/> 13 , which however are <lb/>too small to reproduce the behavior of data. Perturbative QCD cannot give such enhancement, which can be obtained by <lb/>introducing phenomenological soft contributions, containing Sudakov double logarithms. <lb/>There are many open questions that hopefully will get an answer in the near future. Most challenging will remain, very <lb/>likely, the issue of the  ¯ <lb/> pp cross section at threshold. This measurement can be done only by means of ISR, but unfortunately, <lb/>in the case of BESIII, the BEPCII collider foreseen integrated luminosity very hardly will reach the one obtained by PEP-II, the <lb/>BaBar storage ring, even if there is a gain of a factor of 10 or more, collecting data at lower CMS energies. Only the advent of <lb/>the future B or  τ  /charm factories will give an answer to the question of the  ¯ <lb/> pp cross section at threshold. <lb/>However, in the case of heavier, charged or neutral baryons, the detection efficiency at a symmetrical e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  collider is not <lb/>vanishing at threshold, since their decay products have enough kinetic energy to be, more or less easily, detected. This is the <lb/>case for strange baryons pairs and, in particular, for  Λ  c  Λ  c  pairs, that means at a much higher q <lb/> 2 . Therefore the question, if <lb/>at threshold the baryon FF is equal to 1, like a pointlike fermion, will get an answer at BESIII. <lb/>A measurement of the ratio  |G  E  |/|G  M  |  at a few percent level at high energies will be achieved by PANDA and by BESIII too, <lb/>but mostly below 3 GeV in the CMS. It would also be interesting to check if indeed there is no D-wave close to the threshold: <lb/>CMD3 and SND at VEPP-2000 should give an answer very soon. <lb/>The BaBar data show a hint for a sharp step down in the  ¯ <lb/> pp cross section, close to q <lb/> 2  =  9 GeV <lb/> 2 . Very soon BESIII will <lb/>check if such, totally unexpected, step down is indeed there. <lb/>Concerning neutral baryons, the experimental situation will change a lot in the next years. For instance cross section close <lb/>to the threshold will be measured at a few percent accuracy by SND. In this case, in principle, the antineutron annihilation <lb/>can be detected even at very low  ¯ <lb/> n velocity and there is a chance that SND will check if the cross section is zero or not at <lb/>threshold. BESIII will measure the cross section with good accuracy in the 2–3 GeV range. <lb/>By means of the interference between the continuum and the  ψ(3770)  decay into  ¯ <lb/> nn, it is very likely that the neutron <lb/>magnetic FF, in sign as well in absolute value, will be measured by BESIII in the near future at q <lb/> 2  ∼  14 GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>The  Λ  ¯ <lb/> Λ  pair production cross section at threshold has already been measured by BESIII. Hence the question, if in this <lb/>case there is a Coulomb interaction at the quark level, can be already answered. <lb/>Concerning the proton, data exist near threshold. The recent BaBar data have brought essential new information, up to <lb/>large q <lb/> 2 values, based on ISR. The world data are reported in Fig. 48, including the simulated data expected from PANDA. <lb/>The recent data from Ref. [88] have been extended by releasing the kinematical conditions on the hard photon. If confirmed, <lb/>they give a hint that the asymptotic regime according to P–L theorem is reached at q <lb/> 2  ≃  30 GeV <lb/> 2 . <lb/>PANDA will be able to measure the annihilation cross section up to this momentum squared, as first suggested in <lb/>Ref. [286]. The projected results are based on an estimation of the efficiency from Ref. [90] as shown in Fig. 47. Each point <lb/>implies an integrated luminosity L  =  2 fb <lb/> −1  which would be achieved in four months of data taking at PANDA, with the <lb/>maximal nominal luminosity. <lb/>The simulation requires also a modelization for FFs. For the estimation of the total cross section, necessary to extract the <lb/>effective FF of Fig. 48, the parametrization from Eq. (121d) has been used. <lb/>Concerning the FF ratio, the projections for PANDA errors according to the different models are shown in Fig. 49. They <lb/>have been reported along the models, to show the dependence of the estimated (statistical only) error on the value of <lb/> R. The statistical error will certainly allow to discriminate among the predictions available today and reported on the <lb/>figure. Concerning systematics, only a study of odd contributions to the cross section has been done in Ref. [89] showing a <lb/>sensitivity at the level of 5%. Such estimation was based on a simple model for asymmetries induced by two photon exchange <lb/>contribution, but holds whatever is the source of angular asymmetries. PANDA will also make the first determination of  |G  E  | <lb/> and  |G  M  |  separately. <lb/></body>

Conclusion <lb/> The quest for a better knowledge of nucleon FFs is a very active field of hadron physics. We have recalled the basic <lb/>characteristics of the electromagnetic FFs, focusing on model independent and model dependent aspects, connecting the <lb/>SL and TL regions. The discussion and the presentation of models and data have been focused on a compared analysis in <lb/>scattering and annihilation channels. In the present time, when large experimental efforts are done at electron accelerators, <lb/>as well as in electron–positron and proton–antiproton colliders, all data should be considered in a global view. <lb/>Efforts are concentrated on different issues: <lb/> •  extend the available kinematical region towards larger momentum transfer values for testing analyticity and pQCD <lb/>predictions; <lb/> •  gain precision in the region were data are present at small positive Q <lb/> 2 values for the determination of the proton radius; <lb/> •  in the TL region get precise values on  |G  E  |  and  |G  M  |,  in particular at the threshold region q <lb/> 2  =  4M <lb/> 2 and explore the <lb/>unphysical region below the kinematical threshold. <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 49. Data on FFs ratio [287], data are from: Ref. [88] (empty circles), Ref. [8] (empty squares), Ref. [155] (empty triangles). The simulated data for PANDA <lb/>(solid circles) have been reported along the prediction of different models for the TL ratio: [35] (R  p  =  1, solid line), [110] (dashed line), [113] (dash-dotted <lb/>line), [218] (dotted line). <lb/> Different theoretical models have been developed, following the precise data obtained by the JLab-GEP collaboration. <lb/>The physical meaning of the deviation of the electromagnetic FFs from the dipole behavior and of their ratio R  = µG  E  /G  M <lb/> from unity, has been given various different physics explanations. <lb/>We stressed that the first VMD models predicted such behavior, at least qualitatively, long before the data appeared. In <lb/>simple VMD based fits, the built-in relations of isoscalar and isovectors FFs may relate a decrease of G <lb/> p <lb/>E  to an increase of the <lb/>neutron electric FF. More elaborated models with larger number of parameters and QCD-driven terms reproduce all four FFs. <lb/>In frame of the soliton model [195], the decreasing of G <lb/> p <lb/>E  was also predicted before the polarization data appeared introduc-<lb/>ing (model dependent) relativistic recoil corrections. More recently, other explanations have been suggested. In the model <lb/>of Ref. [218] the electric FF would result from a &apos;&apos;screening effect&apos;&apos; in the inner region, due to very large chromomagnetic <lb/>fields. In frame of the diagonal spin basis formalism applied at the quark level [27], this behavior has been related to the <lb/>probability of spin–flip of one, two or three quarks in the proton. <lb/>Higher order QCD logarithmic corrections [288] induce also a decreasing behavior of the ratio. As QCD is not expected to <lb/>work in the Q <lb/> 2 range covered by the GEp experiment, the authors conclude in the possibility of a sign of precocious scaling <lb/>as a consequence of delicate cancellations in the ratio. The zero of G <lb/> p <lb/>E  has been related to non-perturbative effects that sign <lb/>the transition from the parton-like structure of the nucleon to the constituent quark behavior, through the size of a dressed <lb/>quark mass. Although not quantitatively predictable, it has been shown that the behavior of F  2 , in contrast to F  1 , exhibits a <lb/>dependence on an empirical parameter defining the quark mass. <lb/>Note that VDM model based fits may also shed light on the problem of proton radius. A recent work [149] shows that <lb/>the ep data could be in agreement with the precise estimation from the muonic atom. This conclusion reinforces the obser-<lb/>vation that the extrapolation at small Q <lb/> 2 is very critical for determining the limiting derivative. A suggestion how to reach <lb/>experimentally very very small Q <lb/> 2 values through proton elastic scattering on atomic electrons or in a low energy collider <lb/>has been proposed in Ref. [289]. <lb/>Concerning the validity of one photon approximation, which is at the base of the FFs formalism, recent work has been <lb/>done and is ongoing in developing more precise radiative corrections calculations and in their implementation in Monte <lb/>Carlo analysis programs [290], in calculating higher order corrections in frame of the LSF [253], and in investigating theo-<lb/>retically and experimentally the size of the 2γ -exchange contribution. <lb/>The present calculations of 2γ -mechanism are not solving definitely the discrepancy between polarized and unpolarized <lb/>data on ep elastic scattering, as they are in quantitative disagreement among each other and with respect to the full set of <lb/>available polarized data. Further comparison with the models will be provided by the results of the running experiments on <lb/>electron and positron scattering on the proton. The preliminary data from VEPP-3 [244] are consistent with the calculations, <lb/>in particular Ref. [276]. However, in the covered experimental range, they do not show an increasing effect with Q <lb/> 2 , which <lb/>is required in order to reconcile the unpolarized and polarized data on FF ratio. <lb/>Among the models which cannot be extrapolated to TL region, we overlooked the calculations in frame of Lattice QCD. <lb/>Besides the fact that this domain would require an extended description, the application to the TL region is not foreseen <lb/>at present, due to principal reasons. In SL region, the application to the field of FFs has been limited, up to now, to low Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> values, with moderate success [291]. The possibility to use VMD models for chiral extrapolation of nucleon electromagnetic <lb/>FF simulations has not been successful [292]. <lb/></body>

			<body> The experimental facilities where FF measurements constitute an important part of the physics program are JLab after <lb/>the upgrade of the energy of the electron beam at 11 GeV, and MAMI at low energy, in the scattering region. In the annihi-<lb/>lation region, experiments at electron–positron colliders as BESIII, and VEPPII at moderate energy and PANDA, at FAIR with <lb/>the antiproton beam at momenta up to 15 GeV will allow a precise investigation from the threshold region up to large Q <lb/> 2 <lb/> values, where quarks degrees of freedom play an important role. The TL region is expected to bring individual measurements <lb/>of proton electric and magnetic FFs for the first time, and therefore important constrains on the nucleon models. <lb/>Although the field of FFs has a long history, the evolution of the experimental techniques has allowed over the decades a <lb/>deeper understanding of the internal structure of the nucleon, stimulating ideas and model development. The ongoing and <lb/>foreseen programs in electron and hadron machines show that this field is very dynamic and will reserve, in the very next <lb/>future, important breakthroughs. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex"> Appendix A. Relativistic kinematics <lb/> A.1. The Breit frame <lb/> The Breit system for the electron–nucleon scattering, in Born approximation, is the reference frame where the energy <lb/>of the virtual photon vanishes and its four-momentum squared, q <lb/> 2 , coincides with its three-momentum squared, q <lb/> 2 <lb/> B  , more <lb/>exactly, q <lb/> 2  = −q <lb/> 2 <lb/> B  (the subscript B stands for Breit). <lb/>The derivation of the formalism in Breit system is therefore simpler and has some analogy with a non-relativistic <lb/>description of the nucleon electromagnetic structure. From the energy conservation and from the definition of the Breit <lb/>system, one finds <lb/> ω  B  =  E  1B  −  E  2B  =  0, <lb/>where all kinematical quantities in the Breit system are denoted with subscript B. The proton three-momentum can be found <lb/>from the relation <lb/> E <lb/> 2 <lb/>1B  =  E <lb/> 2 <lb/>2B  =  p  1B <lb/> 2  +  M <lb/> 2  =  p  2B <lb/> 2  +  M <lb/> 2  =⇒  p  1B <lb/> 2  =  p  2B <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (A.1) <lb/>The physical solution of this quadratic relation is p  1B  = −p  2B  , as the Breit system moves in the direction of the outgoing <lb/>proton. From the three-momentum conservation in the Breit system: q B  +  p  1B  =  p  2B  , one can find: <lb/> p  1B  = − <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/> , <lb/> p  2B  = <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> The proton energy can be expressed as a function of q <lb/> 2 <lb/> B  , and therefore of q <lb/> 2 : <lb/> E <lb/> 2 <lb/>1B  =  E <lb/> 2 <lb/>2B  =  M <lb/> 2  + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> B <lb/> 4 <lb/> =  M <lb/> 2  − <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/> =  M <lb/> 2 <lb/> (1 + τ ), <lb/> where we replaced the three-momentum in Breit system by the four-momentum. <lb/>Then we can write, for the components of the initial and final electron three-momenta: <lb/> k  1B  = (k <lb/> x <lb/> 1B  ,  k <lb/> y <lb/> 1B  ,  k <lb/> z <lb/> 1B  ) = <lb/>  <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/>cot <lb/> θ  B <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  0, <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> cot <lb/> θ  B <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  0, 1 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (A.2) <lb/> k  2B  = (k <lb/> x <lb/> 2B  ,  k <lb/> y <lb/> 2B  ,  k <lb/> z <lb/> 2B  ) = <lb/>  <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/>cot <lb/> θ  B <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  0,  − <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/>  <lb/> −q  2 <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> cot <lb/> θ  B <lb/> 2 <lb/> ,  0,  −1 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (A.3) <lb/>Therefore, for the electron, one finds k <lb/> z <lb/> 1B  = −k <lb/> z <lb/> 2B  =  q B  /2.

Proton (a) and electron (b) three-momenta representation for elastic eN-scattering in the Breit system. <lb/> The energy of the electron (neglecting its mass) is given by: <lb/> ϵ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1B  =  k  1B <lb/> 2  = (k <lb/> x <lb/> 1B  ) <lb/> 2  + (k <lb/> z <lb/> 1B  ) <lb/> 2  = <lb/>−q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> (θ  B  /2) <lb/> and  ϵ  2B  = ϵ  1B  . <lb/> A.2. Dynamics in the Breit system <lb/> Using the Dirac equation for the four-component spinors of the initial and final nucleons, the current of Eq. (20) can be <lb/>rewritten in the simpler form: <lb/> u(p  2  ) <lb/>σ µν  q <lb/> ν <lb/> 2M <lb/> u(p  1  ) =  u(p  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> γ µ  − <lb/> (p  1  +  p  2  ) µ <lb/> 2M <lb/>  <lb/> u(p  1  ) <lb/> (A.4) <lb/>and is also conserved [293]. The relation of Eq. (A.4) is correct only when both nucleons are on mass shell, i.e., they are <lb/>described by the four-component spinors u(p), satisfying the Dirac equation. It is not the case, for instance, for the quasi-<lb/>elastic scattering of electrons by atomic nuclei, e+A  →  e+p+X , which contains as subprocess the scattering e+N <lb/>  *  →  e+N, <lb/> where N <lb/>  *  is a virtual nucleon. <lb/>Let us prove that Eq. (20) is the most general form which describes the proton vertex, satisfying Lorentz invariance. <lb/>Similarly to the electron, the proton has also spin 1/2, but it has an internal structure, therefore we may generalize Eq. (19) <lb/>as <lb/> J  µ  =  u(p  2  )T µ  u(p  1  ), <lb/> (A.5) <lb/>where T  µ  = <lb/>  <lb/> α  I <lb/> α <lb/>µ  G  α (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  is a combination of Dirac matrices, embedded in the coefficients I <lb/> α <lb/>µ  , and G  α (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  are Lorentz <lb/>invariant scalar functions (electromagnetic FFs). The problem is completely defined by three four-vectors: p  1 , p  2 , and <lb/> q  =  p  2  −  p  1 (or a symmetric combination P  =  p  1  +  p  2 ). In order to build T  µ  , all possible combinations of these four-vectors <lb/>with the Dirac matrices have to be considered, keeping into account that the spinors describing the initial and final (on-shell) <lb/>protons must obey the Dirac equation. One can be easily convinced that 12 expressions can be built, with 9 constraints, <lb/>reducing the combinations to three terms, with coefficients: I <lb/> 1 <lb/> µ  = γ µ  , I <lb/> 2 <lb/> µ  =  q  µ  and I <lb/> 3 <lb/> µ  =  q <lb/> ν <lb/> σ µν  . Taking into account time <lb/>invariance, which must hold for elastic ep scattering (E  →  E, p  i  → −p  i  ), it results that the time (space) component of the <lb/>current changes (does not change) sign. This implies that q  µ  cannot appear, because it is antisymmetric in exchanging the <lb/>nucleons, and that FFs, which have been defined by Hermitian covariants, are real. <lb/>The expression of Eq. (20) of the nucleon electromagnetic current holds in any reference frame, but the Breit frame is <lb/>most preferable for the analysis of polarization phenomena. First of all, in such a reference frame, the explicit expression of <lb/>the current  J  µ  = (J  0  ,  J)  is simplified and its components are <lb/> J  0  =  u(p  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> (F  1  +  F  2  ) γ  0  − <lb/> (E  1B  +  E  2B  ) <lb/> 2M <lb/> F  2 <lb/>  <lb/> u(p  1  ), <lb/> J  =  u(p  2  ) <lb/>  <lb/> (F  1  +  F  2  ) γ − <lb/> (p  1B  +  p  2B  ) <lb/> 2M <lb/> F  2 <lb/>  <lb/> u(p  1  ) = (F  1  +  F  2  )  u(p  2  ) γ  u(p  1  ). <lb/> (A.6) <lb/>Having: E  1B  =  E  2B  =  E B  , hence the definitions: <lb/> p  2B <lb/> 2  =  E <lb/> 2 <lb/> B  −  M <lb/> 2  = <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/> =⇒ <lb/> q B <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4(E  B  +  M)  2  = <lb/> E B  −  M <lb/>E B  +  M <lb/> , <lb/> (A.7) <lb/>and using for the Dirac matrices and the u spinor the representations <lb/> γ  0  = <lb/>  <lb/> 1 <lb/>0 <lb/>0  −1 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> γ = <lb/>  <lb/> 0 <lb/> σ <lb/> −σ  0 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> u(p j  ) = <lb/>√ <lb/> E  +  m <lb/>  χ  j <lb/> σ ·  p  j <lb/> E  +  m <lb/> χ  j <lb/>  <lb/> =⇒  u <lb/> Ď <lb/> (p)u(p) =  2E, <lb/>(A.8) <lb/></div>

Electron polarization <lb/> On the basis of the Dirac equation, for the four-component spinor u(p) of an electron with mass m, one can find the <lb/>following expression for the density matrix of polarized electrons: <lb/> ρ αβ  =  u  α (p)u <lb/> Ď <lb/> β (p) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> (ˆ  p  +  m)(1  − γ  5  ˆ <lb/> s), <lb/> (B.1) <lb/>where ê <lb/> p  = γ µ  p <lb/> µ  ,  α, β  are the spinor indexes. Here s  α  is the four vector of the electron spin, which satisfies s  ·  p  =  0, and <lb/> s <lb/> 2  = −1.  In terms of the three-vector s of the electron polarization in rest, i.e., with zero three-momentum, the components <lb/>of the four-vector s  α  can be written as: <lb/> s  α  = <lb/>  <lb/> s  ·  p <lb/> m <lb/> ,  s  + <lb/> (s ·  p)p <lb/> m(ϵ  +  m) <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (B.2) <lb/>The condition s <lb/> 2  = −1  corresponds to full electron polarization, so s <lb/> 2  = −s <lb/> 2  = −1.

			<div type="annex"> The analytic structure of the FF, defined in Eq. (56), is completely determined by the properties of the function C  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , α  j  ),  i.e., <lb/>by the singularities that lie in the  α  j  integration domain. So that, F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> )  has the same analyticity of <lb/>   (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) = <lb/>   1 <lb/>0 <lb/> dα  1 <lb/>   1 <lb/>0 <lb/> dα  2 <lb/>   1 <lb/>0 <lb/> dα  3 <lb/> δ <lb/>  <lb/> 1  − <lb/> 3 <lb/>  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> α  j <lb/>  <lb/> α  1  α  3  q  2  − α <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  M  2  − (1 − α  2  )m  2 <lb/> π  +  iϵ <lb/> , <lb/> (D.13) <lb/>where the term  +iϵ  (ϵ  →  0 <lb/> +  ) added at denominator moves the poles away from the real axis. This is indeed the procedure <lb/>to perform the analytic continuation of  <lb/>   (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ).  In particular, one defines a function of z  =  q <lb/> 2  +  iη (η  = ϵ/(α  1  α  3  ))  through <lb/>the integral representation of Eq. (D.13), in the upper half z-complex plane, i.e., in Im(z)  &gt;  0. Being  ϵ &gt;  0, the function ñ <lb/> F  (z) <lb/> is analytic and the FF is obtained by taking the limit of Eq. (55). The FF defined in Eq. (D.13), is also vanishing as z  → ∞ <lb/> uniformly in the upper half plane, i.e., with: 0  &lt;  arg(z)  &lt; π. <lb/> Moreover, since the function ñ <lb/> F  (z)  is real for all those real values of z that assure an analytic integral kernel in the  α  j <lb/> integration domain, it can be analytically continued in the lower half z-complex plane by means of the Schwarz reflection <lb/>principle <lb/>   (z) = ˜ <lb/> F <lb/>  *   <lb/> z <lb/>  *   . <lb/> (D.14) <lb/>The existence of real values of z where  <lb/>   (z)  is real, is inferred by physical considerations. Indeed, in Born approximation the <lb/>FF under study contributes to the electron–nucleon scattering amplitude, which is real for SL momentum transfer, that is, <lb/>for negative z  =  q <lb/> 2 . It follows that, in such a kinematical region, the FF should be real and this can be explicitly proven. In <lb/>fact, having <lb/> −α <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  M <lb/> 2  − (1 − α  2  )m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π &lt;  0, with:  α  2  ∈ [0,  1], <lb/>the denominator function is always negative, i.e., <lb/> C  (q <lb/> 2  ≤  0,  α  j  ) = α  1  α  3  q <lb/> 2  − α <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  M <lb/> 2  − (1 − α  2  )m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π &lt;  0,  ∀ α  1  , α  2  , α  3  ∈ [0,  1], and  α  1  + α  2  + α  3  =  1, <lb/>hence, it has no zeros and  <lb/>   (z)  can be analytically extend to all z values that do not generate singularities for the integrand or, <lb/>equivalently, zeros for C  (z, α  j  ),  in the  α  j  integration domain. On the other hand, singularities appear for TL four-momenta, <lb/>in particular the first (lower) positive value of q <lb/> 2 that produces a pole is <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  =  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π , <lb/> and the pole lies at  (α  1  , α  2  , α  3  ) = (1/2,  0, 1/2). In this case we have <lb/> C  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> , α  1  =  1/2,  α  2  =  0,  α  3  =  1/2)  = <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/> −  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π . <lb/> It can be easily verified that each q <lb/> 2  ≥  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t generates a pole in the  α  j  integration domain. Consider, for instance: q <lb/> 2  =  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  +∆q <lb/> 2 , <lb/>with  ∆q <lb/> 2  ≥  0. There is a pole if <lb/> α  1  α  3  = <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  M <lb/> 2  + (1 − α  2  )m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  +  ∆q  2 <lb/> , <lb/> that can be rewritten as <lb/> ∆q <lb/> 2  = <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  M <lb/> 2  + (1 − α  2  )m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π <lb/> α  1  α  3 <lb/> −  q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  . <lb/> The quantity in the right-hand side is always non-negative, being q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t the minimum value of its first term. Since  ∆q <lb/> 2 can <lb/>assume any non-negative value the identity is always fulfilled. The consequent singularity for  <lb/>   (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  and hence for the FF <lb/> F  (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> ),  is neither a point nor a discrete set of points, it is indeed a cut along the real axis of the z complex plane, from the <lb/>threshold q <lb/> 2 <lb/>t  =  4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  up to infinity. <lb/> D.3. The Phragmèn–Lindelöf theorem <lb/> The P–L theorem [37], which can be applied to Sachs FFs, states that: if a function f  (z)  has the two limits <lb/>f  (re <lb/> iα <lb/> ) − −− → <lb/> r→∞ <lb/> a, <lb/>f  (re <lb/> iβ <lb/> ) − −− → <lb/> r→∞ <lb/> b, <lb/>along the straight lines arg(z)  = α  and arg(z)  = β,  with 0  &lt; α &lt; β &lt;  2π , and it is regular and bounded for all z, so <lb/>that arg(z)  ∈ (α, β),  then: a  =  b and f  (re <lb/> iα <lb/> ) − −− → <lb/> r→∞ <lb/> a uniformly for arg(z)  ∈ (α, β).  This is a consequence of the maximum-<lb/>modulus theorem for which an analytic function does not assume the maximum in any interior point of its (open) analyticity <lb/>domain. <lb/></div>

There are three <lb/>possibilities: <lb/> R  =  0, <lb/>0  &lt; |R| &lt; ∞, <lb/>|R| = ∞. <lb/> (D.17) <lb/>It is easy to demonstrate that the first and the third limits violate the P–L theorem.

The result of Eq.

In this case, TL and SL limits are also different, being zero and one respectively, hence they are still <lb/>incompatible with the P–L theorem. <lb/>If we consider the remaining possibility, i.e., we assume the second limit of Eq.

All these observables have to be measured with high accuracy (of the order of  α). <lb/> Therefore, in presence of a 2γ -contribution, the extraction of the nucleon electromagnetic FFs is still possible, but requires <lb/>more complicated experiments, with a very high level of precision. <lb/>Similar model-independent considerations can be done in TL region for  ¯ <lb/> pp  →  e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  [240] and for e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − → ¯ <lb/> pp [31]. <lb/>Here FFs are complex, and the 2γ -contribution introduces in the unpolarized cross section four odd terms of the order of  α <lb/> compared to the dominant contribution: <lb/> dσ <lb/>dΩ <lb/> = <lb/> α <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4q 2 <lb/>  τ <lb/>τ −  1 <lb/> D, <lb/> (E.6) <lb/>with <lb/> D  = (1 +  cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ ) <lb/>  <lb/> |G  M  | <lb/> 2  +  2Re(G  M  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> M  ) <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ <lb/>  <lb/> |G  E  | <lb/> 2  +  2Re(G  E  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  ) <lb/>  <lb/> +  2 <lb/>  <lb/> τ (τ −  1) cos  θ  sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  Re <lb/>  <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> G E  −  G M <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3 <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (E.7) <lb/>where  ∆G  E,M  are the 2γ -contributions to the main amplitudes, and F  3 is the new amplitude of pure 2γ -nature. <lb/>At the reaction threshold, where q <lb/> 2  =  4M <lb/> 2 , one gets G M  =  G E  and the differential cross section becomes  θ  -independent <lb/>in the Born approximation. This is not anymore true in presence of 2γ -terms. However, being of C -odd nature, the 2γ -term <lb/>does not contribute to the differential cross section for  θ = π /2. <lb/> Note that, unlike the elastic electron–nucleon scattering in the Born approximation, the hadronic tensor in the TL region <lb/>contains a symmetric part even in the Born approximation due to the fact that nucleon FFs are complex. Taking into account <lb/>that the 2γ -contribution leads to additional terms in the symmetric part of this tensor, the non-zero single-spin asymmetry <lb/>can be written as (in a coordinate frame in CMS where the z axis is directed along the antiproton momentum, the y axis is <lb/>directed along the vector p  2  ×  k  1  , and the x axis forms a left-handed coordinate system): <lb/> A y  (θ ) = <lb/> 2 sin  θ <lb/> √ <lb/> τ  D <lb/>  <lb/> cos  θ  Im <lb/>  <lb/> G M G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  +  G M  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  −  G E  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> M <lb/>  <lb/> + <lb/>  τ (τ −  1) Im <lb/>  <lb/> cos <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  G M  +  sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  G E <lb/>  <lb/> F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3 <lb/>   <lb/> , <lb/> (E.8) <lb/>which reduces in the Born approximation to the result of Refs. [11,294]. A y  (θ )  is determined by the spin vector component <lb/>perpendicular to the reaction plane. It is a T -odd quantity and does not vanish even in the one photon exchange <lb/>approximation due to the complex nature of the nucleon FFs in the TL region: this is the principal difference with the elastic <lb/>electron–nucleon scattering. <lb/> In the Born approximation A y  vanishes at  θ = π /2  as well as at threshold, due to the relation G E  =  G M  . The presence of <lb/>the 2γ -contributions leads to <lb/> A y  (θ = π /2) =  2 <lb/> √ <lb/> τ −  1 <lb/> D <lb/> Im(G  E F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3  ),  D  =  D(θ  = π /2). <lb/> This asymmetry is an increasing function of the variable q <lb/> 2 : this is due to the presence of the kinematical factor containing  τ <lb/> and to the steep decreasing of the nucleon FFs with q <lb/> 2 , while the 2γ -mechanism becomes more important when q <lb/> 2 increases. <lb/>So, the measurement of this asymmetry at  θ = π /2  can give information about the 2γ -contribution and its behavior as a <lb/>function of q <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> Including the 2γ -contributions, the asymmetry becomes at threshold A <lb/> thr <lb/> y  : <lb/> A <lb/> thr <lb/> y  (θ ) = <lb/> sin 2θ <lb/> D  thr <lb/> Im[G  M  (∆G  E  −  ∆G  M  ) <lb/>  *  ]. <lb/> Note that, at threshold, this asymmetry can be equal to zero, if  ∆G  E  =  ∆G  M  . In this case the differential cross section does <lb/>not contain any explicit dependence on the angular variable  θ  , but only through the amplitudes  ∆G  E,M  which, in the general <lb/>case, depend on the variable  θ. <lb/> The antisymmetrical part of the hadronic tensor H <lb/> (0) <lb/>µν  leads to another single-spin observable: the final electron gets a <lb/>transverse polarization (orthogonal to the reaction plane) in the annihilation of unpolarized proton and antiproton. The <lb/>expression for this polarization is: <lb/> P <lb/> (e) <lb/> y  (θ ) =  2 <lb/> m <lb/>M <lb/> √ τ −  1 <lb/> D <lb/> sin  θ  Im(G  M F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3  ), <lb/> where m is the electron mass. This observable has a T -odd nature, since it is determined by the imaginary part of the product <lb/>of G M  and of the amplitude F  3 , is entirely due to the 2γ -mechanism and it vanishes in the Born approximation. In presence <lb/>of 2γ -exchange P <lb/> (e) <lb/> y  vanishes at threshold, and increases when q <lb/> 2 becomes larger. <lb/>Since it is a transverse polarization, it is suppressed by the factor  (m/M).  Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the <lb/>production of  µ <lb/> + <lb/> µ <lb/> −  -pairs as this polarization is expected to be essentially larger (m  µ /m =  200).

			<div type="annex"> one finds no additional suppression [28]. Another advantage of detecting heavy leptons is that the polarization of unstable <lb/>particles (µ and  τ  ) can be measured through the angular distribution of their decay products. <lb/>Let us consider now the polarization transfer when the antiproton beam is polarized and the polarization of the produced <lb/>electron is measured. We consider only the longitudinal polarization of the final electron because in this case the suppression <lb/>factor  (m/M)  is absent. The corresponding observables are: <lb/> A x  = <lb/> 2 sin  θ <lb/> √ <lb/> τ  D <lb/>  <lb/> Re(G  M G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  ) +  Re(G  M  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> E  +  G E  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> M  ) + <lb/>  <lb/> τ (τ −  1) cos  θ  Re(G  M F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3  ) <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> A z  = <lb/> 2 <lb/> D <lb/>  <lb/> cos  θ <lb/>  <lb/> |G  M  | <lb/> 2  +  2Re(G  M  ∆G <lb/>  * <lb/> M  ) <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/>  <lb/> τ (τ −  1) sin <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  Re(G  M F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3  ) <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (E.9) <lb/>These coefficients are T -even observables and they are nonzero in the Born approximation, and also for elastic <lb/>electron–nucleon scattering. The coefficient A z  vanishes at  θ = π /2  in the Born approximation, but the presence of F  3 <lb/> in the electromagnetic hadron current leads to a nonzero value of this quantity, which is driven by the term Re(G  M F <lb/>  * <lb/> 3  ). <lb/> The expressions of Eq.
