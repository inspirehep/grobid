			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> A general phenomenon of the low-energy structure in heavy atomic nuclei are collective quantum <lb/>states, in particular of quadrupole nature. The proton-neutron residual interaction in the <lb/>valence shell is known to represent the dominant origin for the formation and the evolution <lb/>of nuclear quadrupole collectivity [1]. In order to study the residual proton-neutron interaction <lb/>in the valence shell of open-shell nuclei it is interesting to determine the properties of those <lb/>valence shell excitations where valence protons and valence neutrons move out of phase. Such <lb/>states have been modeled, for example, in terms of mixed-symmetry states in the framework <lb/>of the interacting boson model [2] with proton-neutron degree of freedom (IBM-2). In the <lb/>context of nuclear structure physics the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) is an example of an <lb/>effective field theory (EFT), formulated consistently with the symmetries of the intrinsic shapes <lb/>of the nucleus. It describes the dynamics of collective low-energy nuclear excitations. Effective <lb/>field theories for relevant low-energy degrees of freedom of complex systems are a concept of <lb/>fundamental importance in modern physics with broad applications in many different areas. <lb/>The underlying principle is a separation of energy (respectively momentum) scales such that <lb/>the high-energy degrees of freedom are integrated out leading to a low-energy theory consistent <lb/>with the symmetries and their breaking pattern. The high-energy sector manifests itself in a set <lb/>of parameters in the low-energy EFT which have to be determined from experiment. Thus each <lb/>EFT is only capable to describe phenomena at a specific (sufficiently low) energy scale. <lb/>In the IBM the relevant low-energy degrees of freedom for the description of quadrupole-<lb/>collectivity are bosons with intrinsic angular momentum L = 0 (s bosons) or L = 2 (d bosons). <lb/></body>

			<body> These lead to an effective Hamiltonian whose parameters are adjusted to data. However, a <lb/>microscopic and quantitative theory for the derivation of these parameters is still missing. Such <lb/>an approach could only be hoped for being successful if the dominant origin of the quadrupole <lb/>collectivity would be included in such a theory. Our recent experiments [3] have provided <lb/>evidence on how the coupling to cross-shell transitions forming the giant quadrupole resonance <lb/>(GQR) contributes to the formation of low-energy nuclear collectivity. This has been achieved <lb/>by an analysis of transition densities in electromagnetic and hadronic scattering reactions that <lb/>has enabled us for the first time to observe and interpret the interference of the valence-shell <lb/>components of the lowest-energy one-quadrupole phonon wave functions with those stemming <lb/>from cross-shell excitations. This lecture aimed at a presentation of our recent material and, <lb/>hence, this contribution is based on the text published in Ref. [3]. <lb/> 2. The case of  92  Zr <lb/> To keep the discussion transparent, we studied the formation of quadrupole collectivity in the <lb/>particularly simple case of a nucleus with a low-energy structure that is dominated by one pair of <lb/>valence particles each for protons and neutrons. An example is the nucleus  92  Zr with 2 neutrons <lb/>beyond the N = 50 shell closure and 2 protons beyond the Z = 38 sub-shell closure. The lowest <lb/>2-quasiparticle (2qp) states will therefore have π(1g  9/2  )  2  and ν(2d  5/2  )  2  configurations. Due to <lb/>the residual proton-neutron interaction two different classes of collective excitations appear at <lb/>low energy in which the amplitudes of the two most important 2qp configurations are coupled <lb/>in a symmetric or antisymmetric way, respectively. In  92  Zr, these are experimentally identified <lb/>as the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  and 2 <lb/> + <lb/>2  states [4, 5] with some degree of configurational isospin polarization [6]. <lb/>To shed light on the microscopic origin of the effective coupling strength in the valence shell we <lb/>consider the quasiparticle-phonon model (QPM) [7]. The QPM starts with interacting particle-<lb/>hole excitations from which &apos;phonons&apos; are generated by the Random-Phase Approximation <lb/>(RPA) approach. These form elementary degrees of freedom from which a more general <lb/>Hamiltonian can be derived which allows for multi-phonon states. The QPM covers a sufficiently <lb/> Figure 1. Transition strengths as a function of the maximum 2qp energy included in the QPM <lb/>calculation for (a) g.s. excitation of the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  and 2  + <lb/>ms  states, and (b) M 1 transition between both <lb/>states. The latter are dominated by valence-shell components while the (moderately) collective <lb/>E2 transitions are dominated by admixtures of cross-shell excitations. For easier interpretation <lb/>the situation can be simplified to a three-state mixing scenario as sketched on the right. <lb/></body>

			<body> large single-particle space to satisfy the energy-weighted sum-rules. The QPM approach has <lb/>proven to account very successfully for the low-energy properties in a large number of vibrational <lb/>nuclei [8, 9] including  92  Zr. In the spirit of an interpretation of the IBM-2 as an EFT, the QPM <lb/>can be viewed as &apos;complete theory&apos; including the high-energy degrees of freedom. The QPM <lb/>wave functions are dominated by the lowest π and ν 2qp components, that show the expected <lb/>in-phase and out-of-phase behavior for the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  and 2  + <lb/>ms  states. The electromagnetic properties <lb/>and excitation energies are in excellent agreement with the data [9]. The magnetic moments <lb/>of these states and the strong M 1 transition between them originate almost entirely from the <lb/>valence-shell configurations as it is shown in Fig. 1. However, the B(E2) strengths are generated <lb/>to about 80% from many components beyond the valence shell albeit their total contribution to <lb/>the wave function norm is small. <lb/>The role of the GQR is demonstrated in Fig. 1, which shows the running sum of the B(M 1) <lb/>and B(E2) transition strengths as a function of the maximum 2qp energy included in the <lb/>calculation. The M 1 strength saturates at about 6 MeV, i.e., only valence-shell configurations <lb/>are relevant, while the largest part of the E2 strengths exciting the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  and 2  + <lb/>ms  phonons is <lb/>generated by states in the energy region of the GQR around 15 − 20 MeV. This observation <lb/>motivates a simple three-state mixing scenario between the proton-valence shell configuration, <lb/>the neutron-valence shell configuration, and the GQR for a deeper insight in the formation of <lb/>the one-quadrupole phonon states with symmetric and mixed-symmetry character even on a <lb/>semi-quantitative level [3]. For the nucleus  92  Zr with higher energy for the proton valence-<lb/>shell component than the neutron valence-shell component at the Z=40 sub-shell closure, this <lb/>scheme inevitably requires that the neutron valence-shell component flips its phase with respect <lb/>to the GQR component when going from the proton-neutron symmetric 2 <lb/> + <lb/>1  state to the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>2  state <lb/>with predominant mixed symmetry. Can we find experimental evidence for this simple scheme, <lb/> i.e., is it possible to find a signature for the different interference of the dominant valence-shell <lb/>components with the high-energy mode as predicted in the three-state scheme? <lb/> 3. Experiment <lb/> Apparently, two probes with different sensitivity to protons and neutrons are needed to study <lb/>this quantum interference experimentally which has not been done so far. Electron scattering at <lb/>low momentum transfer provides a measure of the charge transition radius. An (e, e   ) experiment <lb/>was performed at the high-energy-resolution spectrometer [10] of the Darmstadt superconducting <lb/>electron linear accelerator (S-DALINAC). An enriched (94.6 %) self-supporting  92  Zr target of <lb/>9.8 mg/cm  2  areal density was used. Data were taken covering a momentum transfer range <lb/> Figure 2.

The data are compared to QPM calculations. <lb/></body>

Information about the neutron <lb/>transition radii can be derived from the proton scattering data of Ref. [11]. At the incident <lb/>energy of 800 MeV protons interact predominantly via the isoscalar central piece of the effective <lb/>projectile-nucleus interaction [12]. Clearly, the refraction pattern of the (p, p   ) cross section for <lb/>the 2  + <lb/>ms  state are shifted to higher q values as compared to those for the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  state (Fig. 2, left) <lb/>corresponding to a smaller transition radius. <lb/> 4. Analysis <lb/> Using the transition densities from Fig. 3, cross sections were calculated in distorted wave Born <lb/>approximation. The T -matrix parametrization of Franey and Love [12] was used to describe the <lb/>effective proton-nucleus interaction. The QPM calculation reproduces well both the absolute <lb/>values of cross sections for both probes and the shift of the refraction pattern to higher q values <lb/>for the 2  + <lb/>ms  state in the (p, p   ) reaction as displayed in Fig. 2. <lb/>Figure 3 displays the proton and neutron transition densities of the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  (top) and 2  + <lb/>ms  (bottom) <lb/>states calculated in the full QPM approach. The full transition densities (solid curves) are <lb/>decomposed in a collective part stemming from the GQR (dotted curves) and the predominant <lb/>2qp ν(2d  5/2  )  2  or π(1g  9/2  )  2  contributions (dashed curves). The key point is the different <lb/> Figure 3. Neutron transition densities of the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  (top) and 2  + <lb/>ms  (bottom) states of  92  Zr from <lb/>QPM calculations.

			<body> radial behaviour of both parts. An out-of-phase coupling between the neutron valence shell <lb/>contribution and the contribution from the GQR leads to a destructive quantum interference <lb/>that predominantly reduces the neutron transition density at large radii (due to the larger radius <lb/>of the ν(2d  5/2  )  2  orbital) and consequently shifts the maximum of the total neutron transition <lb/>density to the interior with respect to that one for the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  state, as indicated by the arrows <lb/>in Fig. 3. This effect reduces the neutron transition radius of the 2  + <lb/>ms  with respect to the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs <lb/> state of  92  Zr. In contrast, the proton transition radius remains essentially unchanged since the <lb/> π(1g  2 <lb/>9/2  ) part couples in-phase to the GQR contribution in both states. The combination of both <lb/>data sets unambiguously demonstrates that the phase of the neutron valence-shell configurations <lb/>changes its sign between the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  and the 2  + <lb/>ms  state for the first time [3]. <lb/> 5. Summary <lb/> We have presented a simple mechanism to explain the formation of the collective symmetric and <lb/>mixed-symmetric 2  +  states in vibrational nuclei. The proton-neutron quadrupole interaction <lb/>responsible for the mixing of the valence space configurations is mediated by their coupling to <lb/>the GQR, whose contribution dominates the E2 strengths of these states. In contrast, magnetic <lb/>properties can be understood to a large extent within the scope of effective valence-space models. <lb/>A combination of proton and electron scattering data provides direct evidence for the interference <lb/>of high-energy configurations from the GQR with leading valence-space configurations. The data <lb/>are sensitive to the relative signs of the leading valence shell configurations with respect to the <lb/>GQR-contribution and confirm the symmetric and mixed-symmetric nature of the low-energy <lb/>2  +  one-phonon states. In particular, a flip of phase of the neutron valence configuration between <lb/>the 2 <lb/> + <lb/>fs  and the 2  + <lb/>ms  state was observed and is understood as a consequence of the lower neutron <lb/>2qp energy at the Z = 40 proton sub-shell closure. <lb/>Since typical excitation energies of the low-lying collective states are 1−2 MeV and that of the <lb/>GQR 10 − 20 MeV, a clean separation of scales is given, leading to an interpretation of valence-<lb/>space approaches like the IBM-2 and shell model as EFTs of microscopic models capable to <lb/>consistently treat valence-shell excitations and giant resonances. The present findings highlight <lb/>the peculiar role played by mixed-symmetry states in such efforts and in our understanding <lb/>of the formation of nuclear collectivity and of collective phenomena in any strongly coupled <lb/>multi-component quantum system. <lb/></body>
