			<front> EXTENSIONS OF THE COEFFECTIVE COMPLEX <lb/> MICHAEL EASTWOOD <lb/>  † <lb/> Abstract. The coeffective differential complex on a symplectic <lb/>manifold is extended both in length and in scope, unifying the <lb/>constructions of various other authors. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> This article is both an addendum to [4] and a precursor to [7]. In [4], <lb/>we discussed the construction of differential complexes on manifolds <lb/>equipped with various geometric structures. Mostly, these geometries <lb/>were parabolic [5] but there were two exceptions, specifically contact <lb/> geometry for which there is the Rumin complex [14] and symplectic <lb/> for which there is a very similar complex [15], which we dubbed the <lb/> Rumin-Seshadri complex (it was independently discovered by Tseng <lb/>and Yau [17]). This article extends the realm of these complexes, <lb/>specifically covering conformally symplectic manifolds and conformally <lb/>calibrated G  2  manifolds (see, for example, [1, 18] and [9], respectively). <lb/>In [2], T. Bouche introduced a differential complex naturally defined <lb/>on any symplectic manifold M and coined the term coeffective complex <lb/> for it (see also [8]). If M has dimension 2n, then it is the subcomplex <lb/>of the second half of the de Rham complex <lb/>Λ <lb/> n <lb/> d <lb/> − → Λ <lb/> n+1 <lb/>d <lb/> − → · · · <lb/> d <lb/> − → Λ <lb/> 2n−2 <lb/> d <lb/> − → Λ <lb/> 2n−1 <lb/> d <lb/> − → Λ <lb/> 2n  → 0 <lb/> ∪ <lb/>∪ <lb/>∪ <lb/> Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥  → Λ <lb/> n+1 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> → · · · → Λ <lb/> 2n−2 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> → Λ <lb/> 2n−1  → Λ <lb/> 2n  → 0, <lb/>where, if J denotes the symplectic form, then the bundle Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥  is defined <lb/>as the kernel of Λ <lb/> k J∧ <lb/> − −− → Λ <lb/> k+2  . Under the canonical isomorphisms <lb/> J ∧ J ∧ · · · ∧ J <lb/> n−k <lb/> ∧ : Λ <lb/> k ≃ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> 2n−k  for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . n <lb/> the bundle Λ <lb/> 2n−k <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> may equally well be regarded as a subbundle of Λ <lb/> k  , <lb/>which we shall write as Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥  and, as such, provides a natural complement <lb/>to the range of Λ <lb/> k−2 J∧ <lb/> − −− → Λ <lb/> k  for k = 2, 3, . . . , n.

			<body> precisely, abstract indices in the sense of [13]), sections of the bundle <lb/>Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥  for k = 2, 3, . . . , n are precisely the k-forms that are trace-free with <lb/>respect to J  ab  , i.e. <lb/> J <lb/> ab  ω  abc···d  = 0, <lb/>where J <lb/> ab  is the inverse of J  ab  (let us say J  ac  J <lb/> bc  = δ  a <lb/>b  , where δ  a <lb/>b  is the <lb/>Kronecker delta). Thus, we may rewrite the coeffective complex as <lb/>(1) <lb/>Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> n−1 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → · · · <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> 1 d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> 0  → 0. <lb/>Bouche [2] showed that it is elliptic except at Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥  . Since the diagrams <lb/>with exact rows <lb/>0 → Λ <lb/> k−2 <lb/>J∧ <lb/> − −− → Λ <lb/> k <lb/> → Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> → 0 <lb/> ↓ <lb/>↓ <lb/> 0 → Λ <lb/> k−1 <lb/>J∧ <lb/> − −− → Λ <lb/> k+1  → Λ <lb/> k+1 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> → 0 <lb/>commute, there is a canonically defined differential complex going the <lb/>other way: <lb/>(2) <lb/>0 → Λ <lb/> 0 d <lb/> − → Λ <lb/> 1 d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → · · · <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> n−1 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> − − → Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥  . <lb/> In fact, one can easily check that (1) and (2) are adjoint to each other <lb/>under the pairing <lb/>Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥  ⊗ Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥ <lb/>≃ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> 2n−k <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> ⊗ Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥ <lb/>∧ <lb/> − −− → Λ <lb/> 2n  . <lb/> The Rumin-Seshadri complex joins (1) and (2) with a symplectically <lb/>invariant second order linear differential operator d <lb/> (2) <lb/> ⊥  : Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥  → Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥  to <lb/>obtain an elliptic complex <lb/>(3) <lb/>0 → Λ <lb/> 0 <lb/> d <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> −→ · · · <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥ <lb/>  <lb/>  d <lb/> (2) <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> . 0 ← Λ <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> ←− Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> ←− Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> ←− Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> ←− · · · <lb/> d  ⊥ <lb/> ←− Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> In four dimensions this complex is due to Smith [16] and in higher <lb/>dimensions it was also found by L.-S. Tseng and S.-T. Yau [17] who go <lb/>on to study its cohomology on compact manifolds. The construction <lb/>of (3) given in [4] will be generalised in the following section. <lb/>2. Conformally symplectic manifolds <lb/> A conformally symplectic structure on an even dimensional manifold <lb/> M of dimension at least 6 is defined by a non-degenerate 2-form J but, <lb/>instead of requiring that J be closed, as one would for a symplectic <lb/>structure, one requires only that <lb/>(4) <lb/> dJ = 2α ∧ J <lb/></body>

			<body> for some 1-form α (the factor of 2 being chosen only for convenience). <lb/>Non-degeneracy of J implies that α is uniquely defined by (4). It is <lb/>called the Lee form [12]. Differentiating (4) gives <lb/>0 = d <lb/> 2  J = 2dα ∧ J + 2α ∧ dJ = 2dα ∧ J + 4α ∧ α ∧ J = 2dα ∧ J <lb/> and, as J ∧ : Λ <lb/> 2  → Λ <lb/> 4  is injective, we see that α is closed. In <lb/>dimension 4, equation (4) defines a unique Lee form α and, for the <lb/>definition of conformally symplectic, we require that α be closed. If <lb/>we rescale J by a positive smooth function, say <lb/>  = Ω <lb/> 2  J, then (4) <lb/>remains valid with α replaced by <lb/>  = α + Υ for Υ ≡ d log Ω. Hence, <lb/>the notion of conformally symplectic is invariant under such rescalings <lb/>(and also in dimension 4 since dΥ = 0). Locally, we may use this <lb/>freedom to eliminate α and obtain an ordinary symplectic structure. <lb/>Globally, however, this need not be the case. For example, the rescaled <lb/>symplectic form <lb/> J ≡ (1/x) <lb/> 2  (dx <lb/> 1  ∧ dx <lb/> 2  + dx <lb/> 3  ∧ dx <lb/> 4  + · · · ) <lb/>on R <lb/> 2n  is invariant under dilation x → λx and, therefore, descends to <lb/>a conformally symplectic structure on S <lb/> 1  × S <lb/> 2n−1  whereas there is no <lb/>global symplectic form on this manifold. If we continue to denote the <lb/>inverse of J  ab  by J <lb/> ab  , and consider the vector field X <lb/> a  ≡ J <lb/> ab  α  b  , then <lb/>the identities <lb/> J <lb/> ad  J <lb/> be  J <lb/> cf  (∇  [d  J  ef ]  −2α  [d  J  ef ]  ) = J <lb/> d[a  ∇  d  J <lb/> bc]  − 2X <lb/> [a  J <lb/> bc] <lb/> J <lb/> ad  J <lb/> be <lb/> 2∇  [d  α  e]  + 3X <lb/> c  (∇  [d  J  ec]  −2α  [d  J  ec]  ) <lb/> = −X <lb/> c  ∇  c  J <lb/> ab  − 2J <lb/> c[a  ∇  c  X <lb/> b] <lb/> are readily established for any torsion-free connection ∇  a  and show that <lb/>a conformally symplectic structure is equivalent to a Jacobi structure <lb/> (J <lb/> ab  , X <lb/> a  ) if we insist that J <lb/> ab  be non-degenerate (as discussed in [1]). <lb/> Theorem 1. On any conformally symplectic manifold (M, J), there is <lb/>a canonically defined elliptic complex <lb/> (5) <lb/>0 → Λ <lb/> 0  → Λ <lb/> 1  → Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ⊥  → Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥  → · · · → Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥ <lb/>  <lb/> 0 ← Λ <lb/> 0  ← Λ <lb/> 1  ← Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ⊥  ← Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥  ← · · · ← Λ <lb/> n <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> where Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥  denotes the bundle of k-forms that are trace-free with respect <lb/>to J. All operators are first order except for the middle operator, which <lb/>is second order. In the symplectic case, the second half of the complex <lb/>coincides with the coeffective complex. This complex is locally exact <lb/>except at Λ <lb/> 0  and Λ <lb/> 1  near the beginning. <lb/></body>

			<body> Proof. Consider the diagram <lb/>(6) <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> p <lb/> d−2α∧ <lb/> − −−−− → Λ <lb/> p+1 <lb/>d−2α∧ <lb/> − −−−− → Λ <lb/> p+2  −→ <lb/>  <lb/>J  ∧ <lb/> <lb/>J  ∧ <lb/> <lb/>J  ∧ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> p−2 <lb/>d <lb/> − −−− → Λ <lb/> p−1 <lb/>d <lb/> − −−− → <lb/> Λ <lb/> p <lb/> −→ . <lb/> The bottom row is the de Rham complex and, in particular, is locally <lb/>exact except at Λ <lb/> 0  . Since dα = 0, the same is true of the top row. <lb/>Since dJ = 2α ∧ J, the diagram commutes. Now consider the columns. <lb/>In the middle, non-degeneracy of J ensures that <lb/> J ∧ : Λ <lb/> n−1  → Λ <lb/> n+1 <lb/> is an isomorphism. To the left of this, we have injections and, to the <lb/>right, we have surjections. As discussed  §1, the trace-free forms Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> may be canonically identified with the cokernel of <lb/> J ∧ : Λ <lb/> k−2  → Λ <lb/> k  for k = 2, 3, . . . , n <lb/> but also with the kernel of <lb/> J ∧ : Λ <lb/> 2n−k  → Λ <lb/> 2n−k+2  for k = 2, 3, . . . , n. <lb/> The spectral sequence of a double complex completes the proof. <lb/> Explicit formulae for the operators in this complex can be given by <lb/>using indices and an arbitrarily chosen torsion-free connection but are <lb/>quite complicated since they necessarily employ the decomposition of <lb/>arbitrary k-forms into their trace-free parts <lb/>Λ <lb/> k  = Λ <lb/> k <lb/> ⊥  ⊕ Λ <lb/> k−2 <lb/> ⊥  ⊕ Λ <lb/> k−4 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> ⊕ · · · for k = 2, 3, . . . , n <lb/> corresponding to the branching of Λ <lb/> k  R <lb/> 2n  under Sp(2n, R) ⊂ SL(2n, R) <lb/>(cf. the combinatorial formulae in [17, part II,  §2.1]). <lb/> To discuss the global cohomology of the complex (5) let us relabel <lb/>its terms as B <lb/> r  for r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2n, 2n + 1 and define <lb/>(7) <lb/> H <lb/> r <lb/>J  (M) ≡ <lb/> ker : Γ(M, B <lb/> r  ) → Γ(M, B <lb/> r+1  ) <lb/>im : Γ(M, B  r−1  ) → Γ(M, B  r  ) <lb/> . <lb/> In comparison with [8] in the symplectic case, we have <lb/> H <lb/> r <lb/>J  (M) = H <lb/> r−1  (A(M)) for r = n + 2, n + 3, . . . , 2n + 1 <lb/>for their coeffective cohomology but now, for compact M, we have finite-<lb/>dimensional vector spaces for all r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2n, 2n + 1.

			<body> symplectic case, these cohomologies were introduced and studied by <lb/>Tseng and Yau [17] and our notation compares as follows. <lb/> H <lb/> r <lb/> J  (M) = P H <lb/> r <lb/>∂  + <lb/> (M) <lb/>for 0 ≤ r &lt; n <lb/>H <lb/> n <lb/>J  (M) = P H <lb/> n <lb/>dd  Λ  (M) <lb/> H <lb/> n+1 <lb/>J <lb/> (M) = P H <lb/> n <lb/>d+d  Λ  (M) <lb/> H <lb/> r <lb/>J  (M) = P H <lb/> 2n+1−r <lb/> ∂  − <lb/> (M) for n + 1 &lt; r ≤ 2n + 1 <lb/>(Tseng and Yau refer to these and similar cohomologies as &apos;primitive.&apos;) <lb/>According to Theorem 1, the cohomology H <lb/> •  of (5) on the level of <lb/>sheaves of germs of smooth functions occurs only at B <lb/> 0  and B <lb/> 1  and, <lb/>from its proof, we see that H <lb/> 1  = R. Also H <lb/> 0  is a locally constant sheaf. <lb/>Specifically, <lb/> H <lb/> 0  = {f s.t df − 2f α = 0}, <lb/>and may equivalently be viewed as parallel sections of the trivial bundle <lb/>equipped with the flat connection defined by −2α as connection form. <lb/>In the symplectic case, we have H <lb/> 0  = R. Evidently, the top row of (6) <lb/>provides a fine resolution of H <lb/> 0  and so the sheaf cohomology H <lb/> r  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/>may be identified as the cohomology of the complex Γ(M, Λ <lb/> •  ) with <lb/> ω → dω − 2α ∧ ω as differential. The following theorem extends the <lb/>long exact sequence [8, (5)]. <lb/> Theorem 2. On a conformally symplectic manifold (M, J), we have <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> J  (M) = H <lb/> 0  (M, H <lb/> 0  ), H <lb/> 2n+1 <lb/> J <lb/> (M) = H <lb/> 2n  (M, R), <lb/> and a long exact sequence <lb/> 0 → H <lb/> 1  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) → H <lb/> 1 <lb/> J  (M) → H <lb/> 0  (M, R) <lb/> δ <lb/> − → H <lb/> 2  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) → · · · <lb/>→ H <lb/> r <lb/>J  (M) → H <lb/> r−1  (M, R) <lb/> δ <lb/> − → H <lb/> r+1  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) → · · · <lb/>→ H <lb/> 2n <lb/> J  (M) → H <lb/> 2n−1  (M, R) → 0, <lb/> where δ : H <lb/> r−1  (M, R) → H <lb/> r+1  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) is given by cup product with the <lb/>cohomology class [J] ∈ H <lb/> 2  (M, H <lb/> 0  ). <lb/> Proof. The hypercomology spectral sequence for the complex B <lb/> •  as a <lb/>complex of sheaves reads, at the E  2  -level <lb/> ✲ <lb/> ✻ <lb/> H <lb/> 0  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> H <lb/> 1  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> H <lb/> 2  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> H <lb/> 3  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> · · · <lb/> H <lb/> 0  (M, R) <lb/> H <lb/> 1  (M, R) <lb/> H <lb/> 2  (M, R) <lb/> H <lb/> 3  (M, R) <lb/> · · · <lb/> ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ③ <lb/>❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ③ <lb/>❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ❳ ③ <lb/> and the desired conclusions follow. <lb/> (Spectral sequence reasoning can always be replaced by an appropriate <lb/>diagram chase, in this case on the double complex (6).) <lb/></body>

			<body> As an application of Theorem 2, if we consider complex projective <lb/>space CP  n  with J its usual Kähler form, then <lb/>[J] ∪ : H <lb/> r−1  (CP  n  , R) → H <lb/> r+1  (CP  n  , R) <lb/> is an isomorphism for 1 ≤ r ≤ 2n − 1. Therefore, <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> J  (CP) = R, H <lb/> r <lb/>J  (CP  n  ) = 0 for 1 ≤ r ≤ 2n, H <lb/> 2n+1 <lb/> J <lb/> (CP  n  ) = R. <lb/> More generally, Theorem 2 shows that the cohomology H <lb/> r <lb/>J  (M) of a <lb/>symplectic manifold is determined by its de Rham cohomology and the <lb/>action of the symplectic class [J] ∈ H <lb/> 2  (M, R). In particular, there <lb/>are evident inequalities concerning dim H <lb/> r <lb/>J  and the Betti numbers of a <lb/>compact symplectic manifold (including those of [8, Theorem 3.1]). <lb/>3. Conformally calibrated G  2  -manifolds <lb/> Following [9], a conformally calibrated G  2  -manifold is defined as a <lb/> G  2  -manifold (M, φ) such that <lb/>(8) <lb/> dφ = 2α ∧ φ <lb/> for some 1-form α. Recall [3, 6, 9] that φ is the fundamental 3-form <lb/>defining a reduction of structure group on the 7-dimensional smooth <lb/>manifold M from GL(7, R) to G  2  ⊂ SO(7) ⊂ GL(7, R). In parallel with <lb/>the symplectic case, the form φ may be locally rescaled so that it is <lb/>closed (and a G  2  -manifold with closed fundamental form is said to be <lb/>calibrated.) As in the symplectic case and as detailed in [9], the form φ, <lb/> pointwise sometimes known as the Cayley form [6], is sufficiently non-<lb/>degenerate that <lb/>(9) <lb/> φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> k  −→ Λ <lb/> k+3  is injective for k = 0, 1 <lb/> φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> 2 ≃ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> 5 <lb/> φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> k  −→ Λ <lb/> k+3  is surjective for k = 3, 4. <lb/>One way to see this is to decompose the forms on M into G  2  -irreducibles <lb/>(10) <lb/>Λ <lb/> 0  = • • <lb/> 0 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1  = • • <lb/> 1 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2  = • • <lb/> 0 1  ⊕ • • <lb/> 1 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 3  = • • <lb/> 2 0  ⊕ • • <lb/> 1 0  ⊕ • • <lb/> 0 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 4  = • • <lb/> 2 0  ⊕ • • <lb/> 1 0  ⊕ • • <lb/> 0 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 5  = • • <lb/> 0 1  ⊕ • • <lb/> 1 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 6  = • • <lb/> 1 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 7  = • • <lb/> 0 0 <lb/> and check (9) on the level of highest weights. The canonical Hodge <lb/>isomorphism Λ <lb/> k  ∼ = Λ <lb/> 7−k  is evident in this decomposition. Parallel to <lb/>the symplectic case let us write <lb/>Λ <lb/> 4 <lb/> ⊥  ≡ ker φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> 3  → Λ <lb/> 6 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥  ≡ ker φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> 4  → Λ <lb/></body>

			<body> and, by inspecting (10), note that <lb/>Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥  = • • <lb/> 2 0  ⊕ • • <lb/> 1 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 4 <lb/> ⊥  = • • <lb/> 2 0  ⊕ • • <lb/> 0 0 <lb/> also provide canonical complements to the ranges of φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> 0  → Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> and φ ∧ : Λ <lb/> 1  → Λ <lb/> 4  , respectively. From (9) we see that, as in the <lb/>conformally symplectic case, α is uniquely defined by (8) and is closed. <lb/> Theorem 3. On any conformally calibrated G  2  -manifold (M, φ), there <lb/>is a canonically defined elliptic complex <lb/> (11) <lb/>0 → Λ <lb/> 0  → Λ <lb/> 1  → Λ <lb/> 2  → Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥  → Λ <lb/> 4 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/>  <lb/> 0 ← Λ <lb/> 0  ← Λ <lb/> 1  ← Λ <lb/> 2  ← Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥  ← Λ <lb/> 4 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> All differential operators are first order except for the middle operator, <lb/>which is second order. The second half of this complex coincides with <lb/>the coeffective complex defined in [8]. It is locally exact except at Λ <lb/> 0 <lb/> and Λ <lb/> 2  near the beginning. <lb/>Proof. Consider the diagram <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> p <lb/> d−2α∧ <lb/> − −−−− → Λ <lb/> p+1 <lb/>d−2α∧ <lb/> − −−−− → Λ <lb/> p+2  −→ <lb/> <lb/>  ∧ φ <lb/> <lb/>  ∧ φ <lb/> <lb/>  ∧ φ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> p−3 <lb/>d <lb/> − −−− → Λ <lb/> p−2 <lb/>d <lb/> − −−− → Λ <lb/> p−1  −→ . <lb/> The bottom row is the de Rham complex and, in particular, is locally <lb/>exact except at Λ <lb/> 0  . Since dα = 0, the same is true of the top row. Since <lb/> dφ = 2α ∧ φ, the diagram commutes. The columns behave according <lb/>to (9). Hence, the first spectral sequence of this double complex reads, <lb/>at the E  1  -level <lb/> ✲ <lb/> ✻ <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 4 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 5 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 7 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 0 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 1 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/> → <lb/>→ <lb/>→ <lb/>→ <lb/>→ <lb/>→ <lb/> Passing to the E  2  -level constructs the complex and the second spectral <lb/>sequence identifies its local cohomology H <lb/> •  as <lb/> H <lb/> 0  = {f s.t. df − 2f α = 0}, H <lb/> 2  = R, <lb/> with all others vanishing. Finally, ellipticity of this complex is inherited <lb/>from that of the de Rham complex. Specifically, for Λ <lb/> 1  ∋ ξ  = 0, the <lb/>symbol complex of (11) is constructed from the double complex <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> p <lb/>ξ∧ <lb/> −−→ Λ <lb/> p+1 <lb/>ξ∧ <lb/> −−→ Λ <lb/> p+2  −→ <lb/> <lb/>  ∧ φ <lb/> <lb/>  ∧ φ <lb/> <lb/>  ∧ φ <lb/> −→ Λ <lb/> p−3 <lb/>ξ∧ <lb/> −−→ Λ <lb/> p−2 <lb/>ξ∧ <lb/> −−→ Λ <lb/> p−1  −→, <lb/></body>

If such <lb/>formulae are needed, then one simply needs explicitly to write out the <lb/>branching (9) (as is done in [9, p. 365]). <lb/>As in the conformally symplectic case (7), we may consider the global <lb/>cohomology on M of the complex (11), which we shall denote by H <lb/> r <lb/> φ  (M) <lb/>for 0 ≤ r ≤ 9. <lb/> Theorem 4. On a conformally calibrated G  2  -manifold (M, φ), we have <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> φ  (M) = H <lb/> 0  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> H <lb/> 1 <lb/> φ  (M) = H <lb/> 1  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> H <lb/> 8 <lb/> φ  (M) = H <lb/> 6  (M, R) <lb/> H <lb/> 9 <lb/> φ  (M) = H <lb/> 7  (M, R) <lb/> and a long exact sequence <lb/> 0 → H <lb/> 2  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) → H <lb/> 2 <lb/> φ  (M) → H <lb/> 0  (M, R) <lb/> δ <lb/> − → H <lb/> 3  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> → H <lb/> 3 <lb/> φ  (M) → H <lb/> 1  (M, R) <lb/> δ <lb/> − → H <lb/> 4  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) → · · · <lb/>· · · → H <lb/> 6 <lb/> φ  (M) → H <lb/> 4  (M, R) <lb/> δ <lb/> − → H <lb/> 7  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) <lb/> → H <lb/> 7 <lb/> φ  (M) → H <lb/> 5  (M, R) → 0, <lb/> where δ : H <lb/> r  (M, R) → H <lb/> r+3  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) is given by cup product with the <lb/>cohomology class [φ] ∈ H <lb/> 3  (M, H <lb/> 0  ). <lb/> Proof. Immediate from the hypercohomology spectral sequence as for <lb/>the proof of Theorem 2 except that the connecting homomorphism δ <lb/> does not appear until the E  3  -level. <lb/> In the calibrated case (when α = 0), H <lb/> r  (M, H <lb/> 0  ) = H <lb/> r  (M, R) and <lb/>we see that H <lb/> r <lb/>φ  (M) is determined by the de Rham cohomology of M <lb/> and the action of [φ] ∈ H <lb/> 3  (M, R) by cup product. <lb/>4. Other geometries <lb/> There are several other geometries defined by special k-forms for <lb/>which one can apply similar reasoning. Certainly, there are Spin(7)-<lb/>geometries in dimension 8 defined [3] by a fundamental 4-form Φ. The <lb/>construction given in this article extends to this case and, by the work <lb/>of Joyce [11], there are non-trivial compact examples with dΦ = 0. <lb/>Also, there are SO(3) × SO(3)-geometries in dimension 9 defined [10] <lb/>by a fundamental 5-form and SU(4) × U(1)-geometries in dimension 10 <lb/>defined [6] by a fundamental 6-form or 4-form but, for the moment, it <lb/>is unclear whether there are any examples of such geometries that are <lb/>not locally homogeneous. <lb/></body>
