			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> The pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced in <lb/>high energy proton-proton (pp) collisions is a key observ-<lb/>able for the characterization of the hadronic final state. Non-<lb/>perturbative models are used in Monte Carlo (MC) event <lb/>generators to describe the soft-QCD dynamics of the hadronic <lb/>interaction [1,2]. In the forward region, where diffractive in-<lb/>teractions are important, beam remnant and underlying event <lb/>activity make the uncertainty on the particle production even <lb/>more pronounced. Direct measurements of forward pseudo-<lb/>rapidity distributions are therefore valuable in constraining <lb/>the theoretical models. A better knowledge of these effects <lb/>is also important for the interpretation of the high energy air <lb/>showers produced by cosmic rays [3,4,5]. <lb/>This work reports the measurement of the charged par-<lb/>ticle pseudorapidity density (dN ch /dη) at <lb/> √ <lb/> s = 8 TeV in <lb/>the ranges 3.9&lt;  η  &lt;4.7 and −6.95 &lt;  η  &lt; −6.9. The mea-<lb/>surement is obtained for a sample of events recorded with <lb/>a minimum bias trigger in pp collisions displaced by 11.25 <lb/>m from the nominal interaction point (IP) location. These <lb/>events have at least one charged particle with either 3.7 &lt; <lb/> η  &lt; 4.8 or −7 &lt;  η  &lt; −6 and are corrected to include charged <lb/>particles with transverse momentum down to p T  = 0 MeV/c. <lb/>dN ch /dη is here defined as the mean number of charged par-<lb/>ticles per single pp collision and unit of pseudorapidity  η, <lb/> where  η  ≡ −ln[tan(θ /2)], and  θ  is the polar angle of the <lb/>direction of the particle with respect to the anticlockwise <lb/>beam direction. The analysis reported here follows closely <lb/>the ones reported in [6,7]. <lb/> 2 Experimental apparatus and track reconstruction <lb/> The TOTEM experiment [8,9] is composed of three subde-<lb/>tectors: the Roman Pot detectors and the T1 and T2 tele-<lb/>scopes. The related right-handed coordinate system has the <lb/>origin at the nominal interaction point 5 (IP5) of LHC, the <lb/> x-axis pointing towards the centre of the accelerator, the <lb/> y-axis pointing upwards, and the z-axis pointing along the <lb/>anticlockwise-beam direction. The azimuthal angle,  φ  , is <lb/>measured in the (x, y) plane, where  φ  = 0 is the +x and <lb/> φ  =  π/2  is the +y direction. Inelastic events are triggered <lb/>by the two T2 telescopes, which are placed symmetrically <lb/>on both sides of the nominal IP5 at about |z| = 14 m. Here-<lb/>after the T2 telescope covering the positive (negative) pseu-<lb/>dorapidities will be referred as T2+ (T2−). Assuming stan-<lb/>dard collisions at the nominal IP5, they detect charged par-<lb/>ticles produced in the pseudorapidity range 5.3 &lt; |η| &lt; 6.5, <lb/>with full azimuthal acceptance. One telescope consists of <lb/>two half-arms, with each half-arm composed of 10 semicir-<lb/>cular planes of triple-GEM (gas electron multiplier) cham-<lb/>bers [10], arranged within 40 cm length space along the z-<lb/> axis. Each chamber provides two-dimensional information <lb/>on the track position, covering 192  •  of azimuth angle with a <lb/>small overlap region along the vertical axis between cham-<lb/>bers of two neighboring half-arms. Every chamber has a <lb/>double-layered read out board containing two columns of <lb/>256 concentric strips (400  µm  pitch, 80  µm  width) to mea-<lb/>sure the radial coordinate and a matrix of 1560 pads, each <lb/>covering  ∆ η  ×  ∆ φ  ≈ 0.06×0.018 rad, to measure the az-<lb/>imuthal coordinate and for triggering. The radial and az-<lb/>imuthal coordinate resolutions are about 110  µm  and 1  •  , <lb/>respectively. The detailed MC simulations of the TOTEM <lb/>detectors are based on GEANT4 [11]. Simulated events are <lb/>processed and reconstructed in the same manner as collision <lb/>data. The MC corrections are obtained with the PYTHIA8 <lb/>(tune 4C) [12,13] and SIBYLL 2.1 [14] generators, hereafter <lb/>referred as PYTHIA8 and SIBYLL. <lb/>The T2 track reconstruction is based on a Kalman filter-<lb/>like algorithm, simplified thanks to the small amount of ma-<lb/>terial in the GEM planes and the weak magnetic field in the <lb/>T2 region. The particle trajectory can, therefore, be success-<lb/>fully reconstructed with a straight-line fit. Dedicated algo-<lb/>rithms were developed in order to correct for effects due to <lb/>misalignment of the T2 detector. The x and y shifts of the <lb/>T2 half-arms with respect to the nominal positions and their <lb/>tilts in the xz and yz planes are determined with a precision <lb/>respectively of ∼1 mm and of 0.3-0.4 mrad. More details on <lb/>the tracking algorithm and on the alignment procedures can <lb/>be found in [15]. <lb/>The analysis reported in this work is obtained with colli-<lb/>sions occurring at 11.25 m from the nominal IP5. The events <lb/>are therefore asymmetric with respect to T2, whose accep-<lb/>tance is expected to be 3.7 &lt;  η  &lt; 4.8 and −7 &lt;  η  &lt; −6, <lb/> for T2+ and T2−, respectively. Events with charged parti-<lb/>cles produced in this range are expected to be triggered with <lb/>high efficiency by T2 (see section 4 for more details). How-<lb/>ever, only particles with 3.9 &lt;  η  &lt; 4.7 and −6.95 &lt;  η  &lt; <lb/> −6.9 cross a minimal amount of material and are safely dis-<lb/>tant from any detector borders. These tracks are therefore <lb/>expected to be efficiently reconstructed and can be recog-<lb/>nized to come from the interaction region. Simulation stud-<lb/>ies based on PYTHIA8 showed that single tracks are recon-<lb/>structed with an efficiency &gt; 90% for p  T  &gt; 20 MeV/c in <lb/>both the T2+ and T2− measurement range. The fraction of <lb/>primary particles with p  T  &lt; 20 MeV/c generated in the ac-<lb/></body>

			<body> ceptance of T2+ or T2− is below 1%. The  η-resolution  in <lb/>the measured T2+ (T2−) range is better than 0.05 (0.03), <lb/>once the track is identified as coming from the interaction <lb/>region (see section 4.2). The pseudorapidity of a track in <lb/>T2 is defined as the average pseudorapidity of all T2 track <lb/>hits, calculated from the angle between the z-axis and the <lb/>line joining the hit and the displaced IP. This definition is <lb/>adopted on the basis of MC simulation studies and gives an <lb/>optimal estimation of the pseudorapidity of the particles pro-<lb/>duced at the IP. <lb/> 3 Data sample <lb/> The data sample consists of 400k events collected in July <lb/>2012 during a run with a non-standard  β  * = 90 m optics <lb/>configuration and with a bunch pair colliding at 11.25 m <lb/>from the nominal IP5. The probability of overlapping pp in-<lb/>teractions in the same bunch crossing (pileup) is found to <lb/>be ∼2-3%, estimated from the trigger rate for the colliding <lb/>bunch pair. The rate of beam gas interactions is expected to <lb/>be less than 0.5%. The minimum bias trigger provided by the <lb/>TOTEM T2 telescopes, whose efficiency is discussed in sec-<lb/>tion 4.1, required at least one track candidate (trigger track) <lb/>in either T2+ or T2−[16]. With this selection, the fraction <lb/>of inelastic cross section seen by T2 is estimated to be 96– <lb/>97% of the total pp inelastic cross section at <lb/> √ <lb/> s = 8 TeV, <lb/>according to PYTHIA8 and SIBYLL generators. These val-<lb/>ues are ∼2% larger with respect to the PYTHIA8 prediction <lb/>obtained for collisions in the nominal IP5, while the fraction <lb/>of events included in SIBYLL does not change significantly. <lb/>Data have at least a track in both T2+ and T2− in 80% of the <lb/>triggered events. Events having tracks only in T2− (T2+) <lb/>are 9.5% (10.5%) of the total sample. These fractions are <lb/>compatible with PYTHIA8 predictions within 1%. SIBYLL <lb/>instead predicts 86%, 6.5% and 7.5% probability for a trig-<lb/>gered event to have tracks in both T2+ and T2−, only in <lb/>T2− and only in T2+, respectively. <lb/> 4 Analysis procedure <lb/> The pseudorapidity density measurement presented here refers <lb/>to &quot; stable &quot; primary charged particles with a lifetime longer <lb/>than 3 × 10  −11  s, either directly produced in pp collisions or <lb/>from decays of particles with shorter lifetimes. Such a defi-<lb/>nition, consistent with that of previous studies [17,18,19,20, <lb/>20,6,7], considers the decay products of K 0 <lb/> S  and  Λ  hadrons <lb/>and all of the charged particles generated by interactions <lb/>with the material in front and around the detectors as sec-<lb/>ondary particles. The measurement is corrected to take into <lb/>account all primary charged particles with p  T  &gt; 0 MeV/c, <lb/>see also discussion at the end of Section 2. <lb/>4.1 Trigger efficiency <lb/>The effect of the trigger inefficiency on the measurement <lb/>is firstly determined by using a MC simulation. The ineffi-<lb/>ciency of the trigger is mainly due to non-operating and to <lb/>noisy channels which were not used for the trigger gener-<lb/>ation. The list of these non working channels is introduced <lb/>in the trigger simulation, giving an effect on the dN  ch  /dη <lb/> measurement of only about 0.5% with respect to a fully ef-<lb/>ficient trigger. To be sure that the trigger performance is not <lb/>biased by the asymmetric arrival time of the particles in the <lb/>T2+ and T2−, another run which used different time laten-<lb/>cies of the trigger with respect the nominal bunch crossing <lb/>time is also analyzed. The trigger rates of the two runs are <lb/>compatible. This allows us to check that the trigger rates are <lb/>not affected by the different timing configuration character-<lb/>izing this run with respect to the case where collisions are <lb/>provided at the nominal IP (z = 0 m). All the events with <lb/>at least a reconstructed track are considered in the analy-<lb/>sis. The probability that a triggered event has at least a re-<lb/>constructed track is close to 100%. According to PYTHIA8 <lb/>(SIBYLL) the triggered events have a probability of 68.5% <lb/>(70%) of having primary charged particles in both the T2 <lb/>telescopes. The probability to have primary charged parti-<lb/>cles only in T2− is 9% (11%), while the probability to have <lb/>them only in T2+ is 17.5% (18%). <lb/>4.2 Primary track selection <lb/>About 80-85% of the reconstructed tracks in the analysed  η-<lb/> range of the T2− and T2+ telescope are due to secondary <lb/>particles, mainly electrons and positrons generated by pho-<lb/>ton conversions or electromagnetic showers in the material. <lb/>In T2+, conversions are mostly generated in the lower edge <lb/>of the HF calorimeter of CMS and in the beam pipe at z &gt; <lb/> 13 m. In T2−, conversions may happen in the beam pipe <lb/>material and in the CMS detectors close to the beam line. It <lb/>is therefore important to discriminate these secondary parti-<lb/>cles from the primary charged ones. <lb/>In T2+, the most effective primary/secondary particle <lb/>separation is achieved by using the z  impact track parameter <lb/>(see Fig. 1), which is defined as the z coordinate of the in-<lb/>tersection point between the track and a plane ( &quot; π2 &quot; ) con-<lb/>taining the z-axis and orthogonal to the plane defined by the <lb/> z-axis and the track entry point in T2 ( &quot; π1 &quot; ) [15]. This pa-<lb/>rameter is found to be stable against residual misalignment <lb/>biases. <lb/>Simulation studies demonstrated that the z  impact distri-<lb/>bution can be described by the sum of two Gaussian distri-<lb/>butions (hereafter referred to as a &quot; double-Gaussian &quot; distri-<lb/>bution) mainly due to primary particles, while most of sec-<lb/>ondary particles with z  impact in the primary region can be <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1 Definition of the z  impact parameter. <lb/> described by the sum of two exponential distributions (here-<lb/>after referred to as a &quot; double-exponential &quot; ). <lb/>Fig. 2 shows the z  impact parameter distribution in one of <lb/>the central bins of the positive  η  range under study. A com-<lb/>bined fit is performed for each  η  bin of the dN  ch  /dη distri-<lb/>bution with the sum of a double-Gaussian and of a double-<lb/>exponential function, giving standard deviations (amplitudes) <lb/>of both Gaussian functions that increase (decrease) with  η. <lb/> The mean, required to be the same for both Gaussian dis-<lb/>tributions, the standard deviations and the amplitudes of the <lb/>two Gaussian functions as well as the mean and the ampli-<lb/>tude of the exponentials are left free in the fit. The relative <lb/>abundance of secondary particles decreases with increas-<lb/>ing  η.  Simulations predict a contamination of the double-<lb/>Gaussian distribution by secondary particles at the level of <lb/>about 15-20%. They are mainly given by photons converted <lb/>in the material between the displaced IP and T2, with a <lb/>smaller amount of decay products from strange particles. <lb/>These particles are distributed symmetrically around z  impact  = <lb/> 11.25 m, still following a Gaussian-like distribution. The <lb/>T2+ tracks are considered &quot; primary candidates &quot; if they sat-<lb/>isfy a z  impact requirement set, for each  η  bin, such that 96% <lb/>of the area of the double-Gaussian, symmetric around the <lb/>mean, is included. <lb/>In order to discriminate primary from secondary tracks <lb/>in T2− the same strategy as the one described above cannot <lb/>be used. Indeed, MC studies show that the z  impact distribu-<lb/>tion of the primary particles in T2− is much wider. In this <lb/>case, a primary to secondary separation based on the z  impact <lb/> parameter would heavily rely on the MC predictions. This <lb/>worsening on the z  impact parameter resolution for T2− is due <lb/>to the bigger impact that multiple scattering and magnetic <lb/>field have on the extrapolation of the track towards the colli-<lb/>sion region, which is about 25 m away from T2−. Moreover, <lb/> Fig. 2 The z  impact parameter distribution for the data tracks recon-<lb/>structed in one T2+ half-arm in the range 4.2 &lt;  η  &lt; 4.3. A global <lb/>(double-Gaussian + double-exponential function) fit, performed in the <lb/>range from 4 m to 12.5 m, is shown by the solid curve. The dashed <lb/>curve represents the double-exponential component from secondary <lb/>particles, while the dotted curve is the double-Gaussian component, <lb/>mainly due to primary tracks. <lb/> the impact that the telescope misalignment has on the z  impact <lb/> distribution in T2− is expected to be larger as the angles of <lb/>the primary particles are smaller. <lb/>A data-driven selection of the primary tracks in T2− <lb/>is still possible using the  ∆ θ  variable. This is defined as <lb/> ∆ θ  =  θ  f it  −  θ  IP  , where  θ  IP  is the average polar angle of <lb/>the track deduced from its entry/exit point in the detector <lb/>(assuming that the particle is coming from the displaced IP) <lb/>and  θ  f it  is the absolute value of the polar angle obtained with <lb/>a standard fit based on the reconstructed T2 hits. The choice <lb/>of this variable is motivated by MC simulation studies. Fig. 3 <lb/>shows the distribution of the  ∆ θ  parameter obtained in the <lb/> η  region of T2−, which is investigated in this work. <lb/>With respect to the z  impact variable,  ∆ θ  has the disadvan-<lb/>tage of having only one side of the distribution that is largely <lb/>dominated by secondaries. This gives a larger systematic <lb/>uncertainty related to the subtraction of the secondary con-<lb/>tribution. However, MC studies show that the peak around <lb/> ∆ θ  = 0 mrad is still dominated by primary particles and the <lb/>full distribution can be fitted by a double-Gaussian function, <lb/>which mainly contains the primary tracks, and an exponen-<lb/>tial function which describes the secondaries at large values <lb/>of  ∆ θ  . The parameters of the fit are left unconstrained dur-<lb/>ing the fit procedure. More details about this procedure and <lb/>on its uncertainty will be reported in sections 4.5 and 5. Ac-<lb/>cording to MC simulations, part of the secondaries doesn&apos;t <lb/>follow the exponential distribution and cannot be separated <lb/>using the fit of  ∆ θ  , as they give a symmetric contribution <lb/>around 0 mrad.

The dashed curve represents the exponential component from <lb/>secondary particles, while the dotted curve is the double-Gaussian <lb/>component, mainly due to primary particles. <lb/> to the secondaries is predicted to be about 32%. Similarly to <lb/>the T2+ case, a track in T2− is considered a &quot; primary can-<lb/>didate &quot; if it satisfies a  ∆ θ  requirement, set such that 96% <lb/>of the area of the double-Gaussian, symmetric around the <lb/>mean, is included. <lb/>4.3 Event selection correction <lb/>In order to take into account the differences between the <lb/>analysis sample defined at the MC-particle level and the one <lb/>experimentally selected based on the reconstructed tracks, a <lb/>correction factor needs to be introduced. This correction is <lb/>calculated for each  η  bin from the ratio <lb/> C  sel  (η) = <lb/> dN ch  /dη  gen  |  gen selected <lb/> dN ch  /dη  gen  |  reco selected <lb/> , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where the numerator is the pseudorapidity density obtained <lb/>from the MC simulation for events selected based on the <lb/>charged particles generated within the T2 acceptance at the <lb/>displaced IP. The denominator is the density of charged par-<lb/>ticles arriving in T2, obtained by selecting the simulated <lb/>events with at least a track reconstructed in T2, as for the <lb/>data. In general, C  sel is different from unity because of trig-<lb/>gered events where only secondary tracks are reconstructed <lb/>or because of primary charged particles which do not arrive <lb/>in T2. The C  sel correction factor is evaluated with PYTHIA8 <lb/>and SIBYLL. Moreover, to quantify possible biases related <lb/>to this correction, the analysis was repeated requiring that <lb/>events contain at least a primary candidate track in T2+. <lb/>More details on the numerical values of C  sel  (η) and on their <lb/>uncertainties are reported in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5. <lb/>4.4 Measurement of dN ch  /dη in T2+ <lb/>An analysis similar to the ones described in [6,7] has been <lb/>developed to evaluate the pseudorapidity density in the T2+ <lb/>region. The measurement is performed for each T2+ half-<lb/>arm independently, thus providing a consistency check, as <lb/>each half-arm differs in its alignment and track reconstruc-<lb/>tion efficiency. The number of primary tracks passing the <lb/> z  impact parameter selection criteria is estimated for each  η <lb/> bin as a function of the z  impact value, using the double-Gaussian <lb/>and double-exponential fits described in Section 4.2. The <lb/>fraction of primary tracks candidates associated to the double-<lb/>Gaussian distribution ranges from about 74% (lower  η  bins) <lb/>to about 87% (higher  η  bins), and is used to weight each <lb/>track by the probability for it to be a primary. Each track <lb/>is also weighted by the primary track efficiency, which de-<lb/>pends on  η  and on the average pad cluster multiplicity per <lb/>plane (APM) in the corresponding half-arm. The APM prob-<lb/>ability is a rapidly decreasing distribution, with an average <lb/>of about 27 and an RMS of about 26. The primary track <lb/>efficiency, evaluated from MC generators, is defined as the <lb/>probability to successfully reconstruct a generated primary <lb/>track (with p T  &gt; 0 MeV/c) that traverses the detector yield-<lb/>ing a z  impact parameter within the allowed region. Fig. 4 <lb/>shows the primary track efficiency as a function of the track <lb/>pseudorapidity and of the event APM for one of the T2+ <lb/>half-arms. The primary track efficiency averaged over APM <lb/>ranges from about 75% to about 80%. Additional compar-<lb/>isons of the data and MC track  χ  2 -probability distributions <lb/>show that the primary MC efficiencies shown in Fig. 4 have <lb/>to be reduced by 2%. The rate of multiple associations of re-<lb/>constructed tracks to the primary one is negligible (&lt;0.4%) <lb/>once the z  impact requirement is imposed. <lb/>Conversion of photons from  π  0 decays in the material <lb/>between the displaced IP and T2, as well as decay products <lb/>of strange particles, also contribute to the double-Gaussian <lb/>peak. The overall non-primary contribution, to be subtracted <lb/>from the double-Gaussian peak, is estimated as a function of <lb/> η  with PYTHIA8 and SIBYLL. The value of this correction <lb/>ranges from about 17% (low  η)  to 12% (high  η)  and is ob-<lb/>tained as the average of the two MC predictions. The correc-<lb/>tion factor for the event selection bias (C sel  (η)) is found to <lb/>be about 1.1 according to PYTHIA8 and SIBYLL. This factor <lb/>has been obtained after having imposed that both MC repro-<lb/>duce the same relative amount of events with no primary <lb/>candidates as found in the data. Bin migration effects in  η <lb/> are corrected for with PYTHIA8, which gives the best de-<lb/>scription of the slope of the measured dN ch  /dη distribution. <lb/>The effects are typically at the level of a few percent. <lb/></body>

The <lb/>effect of the primary track candidate selection criteria is included in <lb/>the efficiency. <lb/> Events characterised by a high T2 hit multiplicity, typi-<lb/>cally due to showers generated by particles interacting with <lb/>the material before T2, are not included in the analysis. These <lb/>events, where track reconstruction capability is limited, are <lb/>characterised by an APM value larger than 60 and consti-<lb/>tuted about 13% of the sample. The effect of removing these <lb/>events is firstly evaluated in a MC study, which resulted in <lb/>an overall correction factor of about 1.18 (1.28) according to <lb/>PYTHIA8 (SIBYLL). To verify the stability of this correction <lb/>an additional method has been developed: the correction is <lb/>also estimated by extrapolating the measured average multi-<lb/>plicity obtained as function of the maximum APM included <lb/>in the sample, without correcting for the excluded fraction <lb/>of the sample, to APM values above 60. The extrapolation, <lb/>performed with a second degree polynomial, gives a correc-<lb/>tion of 1.11. The average between the factor predicted from <lb/>this extrapolation and the one obtained with PYTHIA8 MC, <lb/>which better describes the data, is used for this correction. <lb/>The fully corrected dN ch  /dη distribution in each  η  bin <lb/>is determined via: <lb/>dN ch <lb/> dη <lb/> = <lb/> C  sel  (η) ∑  evt,trk∈ S  ω  trk  (APM,  η,  z  impact  ) ∑  j B j  (η) <lb/> ∆ η  N  evt <lb/> 2π <lb/> ∆ φ <lb/> (2) <lb/>where S is the sample of tracks with  η  −  ∆ η/2  &lt;  η  &lt; <lb/> η  +  ∆ η/2  satisfying the selection criteria above,  ∆ η  = 0.1 <lb/>is the bin width, C  sel is the correction factor related to the <lb/>event selection (defined in section 4.3), B j  is the bin migra-<lb/>tion correction associated with the j-th bin in  η, ∆ φ  /2π = <lb/> 192  •  /360  •  is the azimuthal acceptance of each T2 half-arm, <lb/> N  evt is the total number of selected events, and  ω  trk is defined <lb/>as: <lb/> ω  trk  (APM,  η,  z  impact  ) = <lb/> P  prim  (η, z  impact  ) S  np  (η)C  mult  (η) <lb/> ε(η,  APM) <lb/> , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where P  prim is the probability for a track to be primary,  ε  is <lb/>the primary track efficiency, S  np is the correction factor for <lb/>the non-primary contribution to the double-Gaussian peak, <lb/>and C  mult is the correction factor accounting for the exclu-<lb/>sion of events with APM values above 60. <lb/>The dN ch  /dη distribution obtained refers to charged par-<lb/>ticles with p  T  &gt; 0 MeV/c. <lb/>4.5 Measurement of dN ch  /dη in T2− <lb/>The analysis of the pseudorapidity density in T2− is simi-<lb/>lar to the one in T2+ (eq. 2). Therefore in this section only <lb/>the differences with respect to the analysis performed in <lb/>T2+ are mentioned. For T2−, the measurement has been <lb/>restricted to only one  η  bin (−6.95 &lt;  η  &lt; −6.9) because <lb/>only in this range the track reconstruction is efficient and re-<lb/>liable. The selection of the primary track candidates is based <lb/>on the  ∆ θ  variable described in section 4.2. The related <lb/>double-Gaussian and the exponential functions are used to <lb/>weight each track by the probability for it to be primary <lb/>(P prim  (η,  ∆ θ  )). The data and the MC fits are required to pro-<lb/>duce the same value of the ratio between the exponential <lb/>and the double-Gaussian function at  ∆ θ  = −2 mrad. This <lb/>requirement reduces potential data-MC differences in the fit <lb/>results, which are due to different extrapolated value of the <lb/>exponential function in the primary region. More details on <lb/>the systematic uncertainty related to the fit procedures are <lb/>reported in section 5. About 35% of tracks with  ∆ θ  in the <lb/>primary candidate region are associated to the exponential <lb/>background. The non-exponential background included in <lb/>the primary double-Gaussian peak region is estimated as an <lb/>average of the PYTHIA8 and SIBYLL MC generator. The re-<lb/>sults of the LHCf experiment on the photon dN/dE distribu-<lb/>tion [21] are taken into account by these two MCs. The non-<lb/>exponential background affecting the primary candidate re-<lb/>gion corresponds to about 32% of the selected signal and it is <lb/>taken into account by the proper correction factor (S np  (η)). <lb/> The primary track efficiency, parametrized as a function of <lb/>APM (ε(η, APM)) when including the effect of the primary <lb/>track candidate selection criteria, is found to be 70% on av-<lb/>erage. This efficiency has been corrected by 10% due to la-<lb/>tency issues leading to a data-MC discrepancy. <lb/></body>

			<body> The correction factor for the event selection bias (C sel  (η)) <lb/> is found to be about 1.02 according to PYTHIA8 and SIBYLL. <lb/>Events having an APM larger than 60 due to the high sec-<lb/>ondary particle production constitute 16% of the sample and <lb/>the associated MC correction factor (C mult  (η)) is 1.03. <lb/>To be sure that the analysis results are not biased by the <lb/>choice of the analysed T2− half-arm and by potential tim-<lb/>ing issue due to the asymmetric configuration of the run, the <lb/>measurement is performed by using two different samples. <lb/>In the run where the latency is optimized for T2+, the half-<lb/>arm in T2− having the better latency is used. The measure-<lb/>ment is then repeated using an ancillary run, where the la-<lb/>tency in the T2− is optimal for the other half-arm. As in this <lb/>case the latency is not optimized for the T2+, the dN ch /dη <lb/>value has to be corrected for trigger losses due to events with <lb/>particles only in T2+. This correction is about 10%. The fi-<lb/>nal result is obtained by averaging the measurements from <lb/>the two different runs. <lb/> 5 Systematic uncertainties <lb/> The systematic uncertainty evaluation for the dN ch  /dη dis-<lb/>tributions is performed in a similar way as in [7]. In the fol-<lb/>lowing details are given only for the most significant contri-<lb/>butions. <lb/>In the T2+ region, the systematic uncertainty in the P  prim <lb/> function, of about 5-6%, is evaluated by taking into account <lb/>three effects: a) the sensitivity to the misalignment correc-<lb/>tions (2%), quantified by varying the corrections within their <lb/>uncertainties, b) the sensitivity to the z  impact parameter fitting <lb/>range (5%), which was changed by ±0.5 m, and c) the ef-<lb/>fect of possible deviations of the fitting function for the track <lb/> z  impact distribution (about 2%). In T2− the leading contribu-<lb/>tion to the error of the P  prim function is given by the fit un-<lb/>certainty, evaluated by changing the fitting interval used for <lb/>the exponential fit in the secondary region and without im-<lb/>posing any constraint at  ∆ θ  = −2 mrad. Since it is difficult <lb/>to model the background in this region, a conservative ap-<lb/>proach has been used, where the extreme right point of the <lb/>fit has been changed from 12 to 22 mrad, resulting in a 20% <lb/>fit uncertainty. <lb/>The systematic uncertainty due to non-primary tracks in-<lb/>cluded in the double-Gaussian once the exponential contri-<lb/>bution has been removed (S np ) is evaluated by taking into ac-<lb/>count two effects: a) the range of the MC predictions (about <lb/>3% and 7% in T2+ and T2− respectively), b) the data-MC <lb/>discrepancy on the ratio between the double-Gaussian and <lb/>the exponential curve in the primary candidate region (about <lb/>4% and 7% in the T2+ and T2− respectively). In the T2− <lb/>these contributions are obtained keeping the relative con-<lb/>straint between the data and the MC fit, as described in 4.5. <lb/>In addition, simulation studies are also performed by <lb/>varying the thickness of the material in front of T2 by 40%. <lb/>This part of the material is the main source of secondary <lb/>tracks that contribute to the double-Gaussian. The effect of <lb/>the change of the material results in a possible bias of less <lb/>than 3%. The systematic uncertainty in the primary-track ef-<lb/>ficiency (ε) is evaluated in studies where tracks are recon-<lb/>structed with a set of five consecutive detector planes (out <lb/>of the total of ten) in a single T2 half-arm. These tracks are <lb/>used to determine the track reconstruction efficiency of the <lb/>other set of detector planes in the same half-arm. The differ-<lb/>ence between the simulation and data results obtained with <lb/>the above method, is found to be about 5% for T2+ and <lb/>about 20% for T2− and taken as estimate of the systematic <lb/>uncertainty. For T2− the uncertainty is larger due to residual <lb/>latency issues. <lb/>For the T2+ analysis, the uncertainty in the correction <lb/>for the exclusion of events with high secondary-particle mul-<lb/>tiplicity (C mult ) is estimated by taking into account the dif-<lb/>ference between the SIBYLL and PYTHIA8 estimates, and <lb/>the result of the data-driven extrapolation procedure. The as-<lb/>sociated uncertainty, about 8%, is taken as half of the max-<lb/>imum difference among the three predictions. In the T2− <lb/>region, high multiplicity events are less rich in primary par-<lb/>ticles and the correction for the excluded events is smaller. <lb/>The difference between the MC predictions, taken as uncer-<lb/>tainty, is about 2%. <lb/>The uncertainty on the correction accounting for the event <lb/>selection (C sel ) is evaluated by taking into account both the <lb/>difference between the corrections from the two MC gener-<lb/>ators mentioned above and the dependence of the dN ch  /dη <lb/> from the event selection criteria as described in section 4.3. <lb/>The overall systematic uncertainty is found to be less than <lb/>3%. <lb/>The maximum discrepancy between the results obtained <lb/>in each half-arm, taken as additional systematic uncertainty, <lb/>is found to be 4% in the T2+ and 8% in the T2−. The statis-<lb/>tical uncertainty is less than 1%. Table 1 shows the statistical <lb/>and the main systematic uncertainties of the measurement. <lb/>The total uncertainty is obtained by adding in quadrature the <lb/>reported systematic errors with the statistical one. A final <lb/>uncertainty of 13-14% (31%) is obtained for the measure-<lb/>ment in T2+ (T2−). <lb/>Additional studies are performed for T2+ to further char-<lb/>acterize the systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty on the <lb/>tracking efficiency and on the primary track selection con-<lb/>tribute to the  η-uncorrelated  part of the uncertainty, which is <lb/>between 1 and 6%. The effect of a possible bias introduced <lb/>by the systematic uncertainties on the measured values at the <lb/>beginning and at the end of the T2+  η  range is estimated to <lb/>be at most 10%. The measurement in T2− is largely inde-<lb/>pendent from the one in T2+. For the measurement in the <lb/>T2−, an  η-uncertainty  of  σ η  = 0.05 is assumed, by taking <lb/>into account both the  η-resolution  and the possible effects <lb/></body>
