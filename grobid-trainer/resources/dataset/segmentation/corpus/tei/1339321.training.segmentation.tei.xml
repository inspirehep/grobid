The cosmic ray energy region 10 <lb/> 15  ÷ 10 <lb/> 17 <lb/> eV corresponds to LHC energies 1 ÷ 14 TeV <lb/>in the center-of-mass system. The results obtained in cosmic rays (CR) in this energy interval can <lb/>therefore be used for developing new approaches to the analysis of experimental data, for interpreting <lb/>the results, and for planning new experiments. The main problem in cosmic ray investigations is <lb/>the remarkable excess of muons, which increases with energy and cannot be explained by means of <lb/>contemporary theoretical models. Some possible new explanations of this effect and other unusual <lb/>phenomena observed in CR, and ways of searching for them in the LHC experiments are discussed. <lb/> Keywords: cosmic ray energy spectrum, cosmic ray composition, EAS, muons, quark-gluon matter. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The discovery of the Higgs boson is the main task <lb/>for LHC, and this task will be solved in the nearest <lb/>future (positively or negatively <lb/> 1 <lb/> ). However, this gi-<lb/>gantic experimental complex will continue to work, <lb/>and its possibilities will continue to expand. The ques-<lb/>tion: &quot; What are the next tasks? &quot; is therefore very <lb/>topical. Of course, there are many tasks connected <lb/>with investigations of hadron-hadron interactions at <lb/>LHC energies, tests of existing theoretical models be-<lb/>havior at such energies, etc. There are also many new <lb/>theoretical ideas: supersymmetry, dark matter, etc., <lb/>which will be searched at LHC energies. <lb/>In parallel with the development of accelera-<lb/>tor equipment and experiments, corresponding in-<lb/>vestigations have been conducted in cosmic rays. <lb/>LHC energies of 1 ÷ 14 TeV correspond to the in-<lb/>terval 10 <lb/> 15  ÷ 10 <lb/> 17 <lb/> eV in the laboratory system for <lb/>pp-interaction (for nuclei–nuclei interactions the up-<lb/>per limit can be higher). And namely at these energies <lb/>many interesting and sometimes unusual results have <lb/>been observed in CR investigations. <lb/>Of course, investigations in cosmic rays have many <lb/>drawbacks compared to accelerator experiments, since <lb/>in cosmic ray interactions many parameters of par-<lb/>ticles are unknown: the type of particle, its energy, <lb/>arrival direction, etc. In addition, the results of CR <lb/>experiments can be interpreted in two ways: as an in-<lb/>vestigation of particle interaction if to believe that the <lb/>energy spectrum and composition of CR are known, <lb/>and as a study of the characteristics of CR flux if to <lb/>assume that hadron interaction model is known. One <lb/>of the main disadvantages is the poor statistics, since <lb/>CR flux decreases very rapidly with the increase in en-<lb/>ergy. However, numerous CR experiments have shown <lb/>that below 10 <lb/> 15 <lb/> eV no serious deviations of the results <lb/></body>

The change in the CR energy spectrum at <lb/>the appearance of the missing energy. <lb/> velopment X  max  . In recent time, new parameters of <lb/>EAS have been also investigated: D  µ  – local muon <lb/>density and N  n  – number of EAS neutrons. <lb/>In principle, two approaches to the analysis of mea-<lb/>sured EAS parameters are possible: <lb/>– A cosmophysical approach, in which it is assumed <lb/>that the EAS energy is equal to the energy of the <lb/>primary particle, and all changes of EAS parameters <lb/>in dependence on energy are the result of the energy <lb/>spectrum or/and the composition of the CR changes <lb/>only. <lb/>– A nuclear-physical approach, in which it is believed <lb/>that changes of EAS parameters are the result of <lb/>the inclusion of a new process of interaction or the <lb/>production of new particles, states of matter, etc. <lb/>In this case, the EAS energy is not necessarily equal <lb/>to the primary particle energy. <lb/>The formation of the knee can be considered as the <lb/>first evidence in favor of a change in the interaction <lb/>model. As was first shown in [1], the knee in CR <lb/>energy spectrum can be the result of the appearance <lb/>of missing energy (Fig. 2), which is taken away by <lb/>undetectable particles (three types of neutrinos) and <lb/>muons, the energy of which is not usually measured. <lb/>To implement this approach, a change in the inter-<lb/>action model at center-of-mass system energy about <lb/>3 TeV is required (for details, see [1]). <lb/>The second piece of evidence in favor of a change in <lb/>the interaction model was obtained from the mountain <lb/>experiments, mainly &quot; Pamir &quot; and &quot; Chakaltaya &quot; , in <lb/>which various unusual phenomena – halos, alignment, <lb/>penetrating cascades, Centauros, Anti-Centauros – <lb/>were observed. Though it was very difficult to evalu-<lb/>ate the energy of the primary CR particles in these <lb/>experiments, a comparison of the intensity of the ob-<lb/>served events with the intensity of the cosmic rays <lb/>shows that these events appear at energies between <lb/> 10 <lb/> 15 <lb/> and 10 <lb/> 16 <lb/> eV. A more detailed description and an <lb/>anlysis of the unusual events were made earlier [2]. <lb/>The third piece of evidence in favor of new physics <lb/>was obtained in CR investigations in muon experi-<lb/>ments. First, it is the ever-increasing excess of the <lb/>ratio of the number of muons to the number of elec-<lb/>trons compared with the predicted ratio at energies <lb/>10 <lb/> 15  ÷ 10 <lb/> 17 <lb/> eV. This increase can be explained by <lb/>the change in the CR composition. However, a fur-<lb/>ther increase in this ratio and the appearance of the <lb/>muon excess even for the assumption of a pure iron <lb/>composition can evidence at inclusion of new physical <lb/>processes. The situation is the same with muons of <lb/>very high energies (&gt; 100 TeV). The tendency toward <lb/>the appearance of a muon excess with increasing muon <lb/>energy to 100 TeV is remarkable [3]. <lb/> 3. Possible version of a new <lb/>interaction model <lb/> A possible model for describing all unusual phenomena <lb/>observed in CR investigations above 10 <lb/> 15 <lb/> eV must <lb/>satisfy the following requirements: <lb/> (1.)  Threshold behavior (unusual events appear at <lb/>several PeV only). <lb/> (2.)  Large cross section (to change the EAS spectrum <lb/>slope). <lb/> (3.)  Large yield of leptons (excess of VHE muons, <lb/>missing energy and penetrating cascades). <lb/> (4.)  Large orbital momentum (alignment). <lb/> (5.)  Quicker development of EAS (to increase the <lb/> N  µ  /N  e  ratio and decrease the X  max  elongation <lb/>rate). <lb/>There are various ways to construct the necessary <lb/>model, from including a new (e.g., super-strong) inter-<lb/>action at distances of about 10 <lb/> −17 <lb/> cm and generating <lb/>new massive particles (m ∼ 1 TeV), to producing blobs <lb/>of quark-gluon matter (QGM). We consider the last <lb/>model, since it provides a demonstrable explanation of <lb/>the inclusion of a new interaction and provides the pre-<lb/>dictions that can be checked both in CR investigations <lb/>and in LHC experiments. <lb/>The production of QGM provides two main condi-<lb/>tions: <lb/>– threshold behavior, since a high temperature (en-<lb/>ergy) is required for it; <lb/>– a large cross section, since the transition occurs <lb/>from a quark–quark interaction to some collective <lb/>interaction of many quarks: <lb/> σ = π¯ λ <lb/> 2  → σ ∼ π(¯ λ + R) <lb/> 2 <lb/> or π(R  1  + R  2  ) <lb/> 2  , (1) <lb/>where R, R  1  and R  2  are sizes of quark-gluon blobs. <lb/>However, a large value of the orbital angular momen-<lb/>tum is required for an explanation of other observed <lb/>phenomena. <lb/>As has been shown by Zuo-Tang Liang and Xin-Nian <lb/>Wang [4], a globally polarized QGP with large orbital <lb/>angular momentum which increases with energy as <lb/> L ∼ <lb/>√ <lb/> s appears in non-central ion–ion collisions.

The production of the knee with some <lb/> &quot; bump &quot; in the nuclear-physical approach. <lb/> this case, a blob of quark-gluon matter can be con-<lb/>sidered as a usual resonance with a large centrifugal <lb/>barrier. Centrifugal barrier V (L) = L <lb/> 2  /2mr <lb/> 2 <lb/> will be <lb/>large for light quarks but small for top-quarks or other <lb/>heavy particles. The orbital angular momentum value <lb/>can be of the order of 10 <lb/> 5 <lb/> [5]. The probability of the <lb/>production of top–antitop pairs therefore increases. <lb/>However, simultaneous interaction of many quarks <lb/>changes the energy in the center-of-mass system dras-<lb/>tically: <lb/> √ <lb/> s = <lb/> 2m  p  E  0  → <lb/> 2m  c  E  0  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where the mass of the QGM blob m  c  ≈ nm  N  . At <lb/>threshold energy, n ∼ 4 (α-particle). The t ¯ t-quarks <lb/>that are produced take away the energy ε  t  &gt; 2m  t  ≈ <lb/> 350 GeV, and taking into account the fly-out energy, <lb/> ε  t  &gt; 4m  t  ≈ 700 GeV in the center-of-mass system. <lb/>Top-quarks decay in the following way: t ¯ t → <lb/> W <lb/> + <lb/> (W <lb/> − <lb/> ) + b( ¯ <lb/>b). In their turn, W-bosons decay into <lb/>leptons (∼ 30 %) and hadrons (∼ 70 %); b → c → <lb/> s → u with the production of muons and neutrinos. <lb/> 4. Consequences for CR <lb/>experiments <lb/> One part of the t-quark energy gives the missing en-<lb/>ergy (ν  e  , ν  µ  , ν  τ  , µ), and another part changes the EAS <lb/>development, especially its beginning, the parameters <lb/>of which are not measured. As a result, additional <lb/>muons appear, the measured EAS energy E  EAS  will <lb/>not be equal to the primary particle energy E  0  , and <lb/>the measured spectrum will be different from the pri-<lb/>mary spectrum (Fig. 2). Transition of particles from <lb/>energy E  0  to energy E  EAS  leads to a bump in the <lb/>energy spectrum near the threshold (Fig. 3), which <lb/>appears if we sum the two solid curves in Fig. 2. The <lb/>appearance of other bumps in Fig. 4 is explained in <lb/>the same way. <lb/>Since not only high temperature (energy) but also <lb/>high density is required for QGM production, the <lb/>threshold energy for the production of a new state of <lb/>matter for heavy nuclei will be less than for light nuclei <lb/> 10 <lb/> 15 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 16 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 17 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 18 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 19 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 2 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 3 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 4 <lb/> 10 <lb/> 5 <lb/> E <lb/> 2.7 <lb/> dN/dE, <lb/> GeV <lb/> 1.7 <lb/> m <lb/> -2 <lb/> s <lb/> -1 <lb/> sr <lb/> -1 <lb/> E, eV <lb/> all primary nuclei <lb/>H <lb/>He <lb/>CNO <lb/>NeMgSi <lb/>Fe <lb/> Figure 4. Energy spectra of basic groups of CR nuclei <lb/>and the formation of the all-particle spectrum. <lb/> and protons. The heavy nuclei (e.g., iron) spectra are <lb/>therefore changed earlier than the light nuclei and <lb/>proton spectra. <lb/>The measured spectra of different nuclei will not <lb/> correspond to the primary composition (Fig. 4). Thus, <lb/>the observed increase in the mass of the CR compo-<lb/>sition is explained not by its real change, but by <lb/>increasing detection probability of EAS generated by <lb/>heavy nuclei. <lb/>In framework of this hypothesis, the so-called muon <lb/>problem (muon puzzle) – the excessive number of <lb/>measured EAS muons compared to the simulated <lb/>number even for pure iron composition of primary CR – <lb/>can be solved, since with 70 % probability W-bosons <lb/>decay into hadrons (mainly pions) with an average <lb/>number of about 20, and the multiplicity of secondary <lb/>particles (and also muons) begins to increase more <lb/>sharply than the existing models predict. <lb/>There is a more interesting situation with the muon <lb/>energy spectrum. As was shown in the first paper <lb/>about the nuclear-physical approach to the explana-<lb/>tion of the knee [1], in this case a considerable excess <lb/>of very high energy muons (&gt; 100 TeV) must appear. <lb/>Figure 5 presents the results of muon energy spectrum <lb/>simulation in the framework of the QGM model. Since <lb/>CORSIKA does not include t ¯ t-quark production, the <lb/>well-known PYTHIA code was used to introduce them. <lb/>One can see that a remarkable excess of muons ap-<lb/>pears only at energies near 100 TeV. The contribution <lb/>of t ¯ t-quarks leads to a sharper increase of the muon <lb/>spectrum than in the case of so-called prompt muons. <lb/>It is a very difficult task to get experimental data <lb/>at such energies, and the corresponding results have <lb/>been obtained only in recent years [6, 7]. <lb/>Since there are no other ways to generate VHE <lb/>muons, apart from the production of massive particles <lb/>(state of matter), these results practically prove the <lb/>approach considered here. If this effect does not disap-<lb/>pear when there is a further increase in the statistics <lb/>in the IceCube experiment, it will provide excellent <lb/>proof of the validity of the nuclear-physical approach. <lb/></body>

Consequences for the LHC <lb/>experiments <lb/> On the face of it, the search for QGM with the charac-<lb/>teristics described above (excess of t-quarks, excess of <lb/>VHE muons, sharp increasing of missing energy, etc.) <lb/>is a very simple task. However, there is apparently no <lb/>possibility to observe it in pp-interactions even at full <lb/>LHC energy 14 TeV, since larger energies are required <lb/>for that. <lb/>In fact, detailed investigations of pp-interactions at <lb/>total energy 7 TeV showed very good agreement with <lb/>the predictions of existing theoretical models, and no <lb/>evidence of new physics was obtained [8]. However, <lb/>in nuclei–nuclei interactions some deviations were ob-<lb/>served. The first of them is sharper increase in the <lb/>charged particle multiplicity than in the predictions <lb/>of the simulations (Fig. 6 [9]) in the interactions of <lb/>the nuclei. Of course, a single experimental point is <lb/>not sufficient to draw serious conclusion about new <lb/>physics, but the tendency is very clear. <lb/>The second result which can provide evidence in <lb/>favor of QGM production is the detection of highly <lb/>asymmetric dijet events (Fig. 7, [10]). In the frame-<lb/>work of the model considered here, these events can <lb/>be explained very simply. When a top-quark decays <lb/>in the center-of-mass system, the kinetic energy is <lb/>distributed as T  b  ∼ 65 GeV, and T  W  ∼ 25 GeV. If one <lb/>takes into account the fly-out energy of the top-quark, <lb/> T  b  can be more than 100 GeV. In the case that the <lb/>b-quark gives a jet and W decays into ∼ 20 π, the <lb/>ATLAS event can be obtained. <lb/>Some evidence of QGM production in the nuclei– <lb/>nuclei interactions in the LHC experiments are there-<lb/> Figure 6. Results of charged particle multiplicity <lb/>measurements at LHC energy 3 TeV [9]. <lb/> Figure 7. Highly asymmetric dijet event observed in <lb/>ATLAS in heavy ion collisions [10]. <lb/> fore obtained. However, a more detailed investigation <lb/>of the new state of matter at LHC will be not so <lb/>easy, since usual accelerator methods of searching for <lb/>relatively narrow resonances in pp-interactions cannot <lb/>be applied in the case of blobs of QGM production. <lb/>When hot blobs of QGM decay, it is very difficult <lb/>to wait for the reconstruction of a narrow resonance <lb/>state. Apparently, new methods for investigations of <lb/>the new state of matter will need to be developed. <lb/>One possible method is an evaluation of the missing <lb/>energy, an increase in which with total energy will <lb/>provide evidence in favor of the production of QGM <lb/>or some other new state of matter. <lb/> 6. Discussion <lb/> It should be noted that the considered model of QGM <lb/>blob production can be checked in very different ways <lb/>in CR investigations and in LHC experiments. Since <lb/>the life time of a QGM blob is very short (in spite of its <lb/>very large orbital angular momentum and centrifugal <lb/>barrier), it is very difficult to obtain any evidence <lb/>of its existence by measuring most of the usually <lb/>detected parameters. Apparently, two values can be <lb/>used: the multiplicity of charged particles, which will <lb/>be sharply increased with increasing energy and mass <lb/>of the interacting nuclei, and the average missing <lb/>energy in certain types of events. <lb/>From this point of view, the experiments in cos-<lb/></body>

			<body> mic rays have some advantages connected with the <lb/>large longitudinal momentum of the primary parti-<lb/>cles. For this reason, the muons (and neutrinos) from <lb/>the W-boson decays have energy not of ∼ 40 GeV <lb/>(as in the center-of-mass system) but of more than <lb/>100 TeV. Unfortunately, very large detectors are re-<lb/>quired for muons with such energy. It is therefore <lb/>very difficult to predict in what kind of experiment <lb/>an exhaustive proof of new physics (production of <lb/>QGM blobs, or some other new state of matter) will <lb/>be obtained, though the author has no doubt that the <lb/>nuclear-physical approach is correct. <lb/> 7. Conclusions <lb/> The approach considered here, based on the produc-<lb/>tion of QGM blobs, which allows an explaination of <lb/>practically all problems of cosmic ray investigations <lb/>above 10 <lb/> 15 <lb/> eV, shows that this new physics at LHC <lb/>energies can be found in nuclei–nuclei interactions <lb/>only. Two clear predictions can be made: a quicker <lb/>increase in charged particle multiplicity and in missing <lb/>energy with the increase in energy and the mass of <lb/>the interacting nuclei. <lb/></body>
