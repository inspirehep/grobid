The single-dish configuration of the MAGIC Cherenkov telescope has been in <lb/>operation since 2004 , with an operational window of 0.03–30 TeV. The stereo configura-<lb/>tion, made possible by the recently completed second dish, is due to start a second phase of <lb/>MAGIC operation soon. In this paper we offer a review of MAGIC phase-1 (mono) results. <lb/> Key words.

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The Imaging Air Cherenkov (IAC) technique <lb/>(e.g., De Angelis et al. 2008 for a review) uses <lb/>the atmosphere as a calorimeter to detect the <lb/>extensive air shower produced after the in-<lb/>teraction of a VHE γ-ray. The charged par-<lb/>ticles (mainly electrons and positrons) in the <lb/>air shower produce Cherenkov light that can <lb/>be easily detected with photomultipliers on the <lb/>ground. An IAC telescope (IACT) uses a large <lb/>reflector area to concentrate as much as possi-<lb/>ble of these photons and focus them to a cam-<lb/>era where an image of the atmospheric cascade <lb/>is formed. By analysing this image it is possi-<lb/>ble to reconstruct the incoming direction and <lb/>the energy of the γ-ray. The analysis of the <lb/>images is also used to reject the much higher <lb/>background of cosmic rays initiated showers. <lb/>The ground-breaking work of the Whipple <lb/>IACT led to the earliest detections of sources <lb/>in the photon VHE (i.e., ∼0.1-100 TeV) <lb/>band, the Crab nebula (Weekes et al. 1989) <lb/>and the blazar Mkn 421 (Punch et al. 1992). <lb/>These pioneering attempts started VHE as-<lb/>trophysics. Following on, the first genera-<lb/>tion of major IACTs – that included CAT <lb/>(1996-2003), CANGAROO (1992-2001) and <lb/>HEGRA (1993-2002), in addition to Whipple <lb/>(1969-....) itself – broadened the discovery <lb/>potential of the new field by detecting sev-<lb/>eral more active galactic nuclei and Galactic <lb/>sources. Thanks to reduced low-energy thresh-<lb/>olds, improved sensitivities, wider-field cam-<lb/>eras, and lighter mechanical structures, the cur-<lb/>rent second-generation IACTs – i.e., H.E.S.S. <lb/>(2003-), MAGIC (2004-), CANGAROO-III <lb/>(2004-), and VERITAS (2006-) – have taken <lb/>VHE astrophysics into maturity. In this paper <lb/>we highlight some recent progress in VHE as-<lb/>trophysics obtained with MAGIC. <lb/> 2. The MAGIC telescope <lb/> The Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging <lb/>Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope is a last-<lb/>generation instrument for very high energy <lb/>(VHE, E ∼ &gt; 50 GeV) γ-ray observation exploit-<lb/>ing the IAC technique. It is located on <lb/>the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory <lb/></body>

			<body> (28 <lb/> •  45 <lb/>  30 <lb/>  N, 17 <lb/> •  52 <lb/>  48 <lb/>  W, 2250 m above see <lb/>level) in the North-Atlantic Canary island of La <lb/>Palma, Spain. <lb/>Due to its large collection area (17 m diam-<lb/>eter) and uniquely designed camera, MAGIC <lb/>has reached the lowest energy threshold (&apos;stan-<lb/>dard&apos; trigger threshold 50–60 GeV at small <lb/>zenith angles, &apos;sum&apos; trigger for pulsar obser-<lb/>vations ∼25 GeV) among IACTs. <lb/>Since February 2007, MAGIC signal dig-<lb/>itization has been upgraded to 2 GSample/s <lb/>Flash Analog-to-Digital Converters (FADCs), <lb/>and timing parameters are used during the data <lb/>analysis (Aliu et al. 2009a). This results in an <lb/>improvement of the flux sensitivity from 2.5% <lb/>to 1.6% (at a flux peak energy of 280 GeV) of <lb/>the Crab Nebula flux in 50 hours of observa-<lb/>tions. Its energy resolution is about 30% above <lb/>100 GeV and about 25% from 200 GeV on-<lb/>wards. The angular resolution is ∼ 0.1 <lb/> •  , while <lb/>source localization in the sky is provided with <lb/>a precision of ∼ 2 <lb/>  . The MAGIC standard anal-<lb/>ysis chain is described, e.g., in Albert et al. <lb/>(2008a). <lb/>Observations during moderate moonshine <lb/>enable to increase MAGIC&apos;s duty cycle by a <lb/>factor ∼1.5 w.r.t. using only dark time, and a <lb/>better sampling of variable sources. <lb/>MAGIC has been operating in single-dish <lb/>configuration since fall 2004, carrying out a <lb/>physics program which includes both, topics <lb/>of fundamental physics and astrophysics. A re-<lb/>cently completed second telescope will soon <lb/>allow MAGIC to start stereoscopic observa-<lb/>tions with improved sensitivity (∼ 0.8 Crab <lb/>units in 50-hour observation). <lb/> 3. Galactic sources <lb/> In a break-through VHE survey of the Galactic <lb/>plane, the southern-located H.E.S.S. telescope <lb/>discovered a plethora of sources previously <lb/>unknown in other wavebands (Aharonian et <lb/>al. 2006a). Further Galactic sources, accessi-<lb/>ble from the northern hemisphere, were subse-<lb/>quently observed with MAGIC. <lb/>Proposed counterparts of such Galactic <lb/>VHE sources include supernova remnants <lb/>(SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and ac-<lb/>creting binaries. Whatever their detailed na-<lb/>ture, it is expected that Galactic VHE sources <lb/>are related to evolutionary endproducts of mas-<lb/>sive, bright, short-lived, stellar progenitors. <lb/>Hence, these Galactic VHE sources are imme-<lb/>diate tracers of the current star formation. <lb/>In this section we highlight the MAGIC <lb/>contributions to Galactic astrophysics. <lb/> 3.1. The unidentified  γ-ray  source <lb/>TeV J2032+4130 <lb/> The TeV source TeV J2032+4130 was the first <lb/>unidentified VHE γ-ray source, and also the <lb/>first discovered extended TeV source, likely to <lb/>be Galactic (Aharonian et al. 2002a). The field <lb/>of view of TeV J2032+4130 was observed <lb/>with MAGIC for 93.7 hours of good-quality <lb/>data, between 2005 and 2007 (Albert et al. <lb/>2008b). The source appears extended w.r.t. <lb/>the MAGIC psf, its intrinsic size being (for a <lb/>Gaussian profile) σ  src  = 5.0 ± 1.7 stat  ± 0.6 sys <lb/> arcmin. The energy spectrum is well fitted <lb/>(χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ν  = 0.3) by <lb/> d <lb/> 3  N <lb/> dE dA dt  = (4.5 ± 0.3 stat  ± 1.5 sys ) × <lb/> 10 <lb/> −13  (E/1 TeV) <lb/> −2.0±0.3  stat  ±0.2  sys TeV <lb/> −1  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  . <lb/>The energy spectrum measured by MAGIC <lb/>is compatible both in flux level and photon <lb/>index with the one measured by HEGRA, and <lb/>extends it down to 400 GeV. The MAGIC data <lb/>show no spectral break nor any flux variability <lb/>over the 3 years of observations. <lb/> 3.2. Shell-type supernova remnants: <lb/>Cassiopeia A and IC 433 <lb/> Galactic cosmic rays have long been suspected <lb/>to be produced at supernova (SN) shock fronts <lb/>via diffusive acceleration. If the observed VHE <lb/> γ-rays were found to be generated through the <lb/>hadronic channel, then the acceleration by SNe <lb/>of nuclei to energies of the order of the knee <lb/>in the CR spectrum would be virtually proven <lb/>(e.g., Torres et al. 2003). However, it is dif-<lb/>ficult to disentangle the hadronic VHE com-<lb/>ponent from the leptonic one, produced by <lb/>inverse-Compton (IC) scattering, by measur-<lb/>ing γ-rays over only a decade or so in en-<lb/>ergy. The VHE data of RX J1713.7-3946 can <lb/>be explained in terms of either channel, lep-<lb/>tonic/hadronic if the relevant magnetic field <lb/></body>

			<body> is low/high (B∼10/100 µG: Aharonian et al. <lb/>2006b and Berezhko &amp; Völk 2006). Data in the <lb/> ∼0.1–100 GeV band, such as those to be pro-<lb/>vided by AGILE and Fermi Gamma-ray Space <lb/>Telescope, are clearly needed to discriminate <lb/>between the two channels. <lb/>Whatever the details, the detection of pho-<lb/>tons with energy ∼ &gt; 100 TeV from RX J1713.7-<lb/>3946 is a proof of the acceleration of pri-<lb/>mary particles in SN shocks to energies well <lb/>above 10 <lb/> 14 eV. The differential VHE spec-<lb/>tral index is ∼2.1 all across this SNR, sug-<lb/>gesting that the emitting particles are ubiq-<lb/>uitously strong-shock accelerated, up to en-<lb/>ergies ∼200/100 TeV for primary CR pro-<lb/>tons/electrons if the hadronic/leptonic channel <lb/>is at work (Aharonian et al. 2007). This is get-<lb/>ting close to the knee of the CR spectrum, <lb/> ∼10 <lb/> 15.5 eV, that signals the high-energy end of <lb/>the Galactic CR distribution (e.g., Blasi 2005). <lb/>Circumstantial evidence supports a <lb/>hadronic origin of the VHE emission. In <lb/>several expanding SNRs the X-ray brightness <lb/>profile behind the forward shock is best <lb/>explained as synchrotron emission from <lb/>energetic electrons in high magnetic fields, <lb/> B∼O(10 <lb/> 2 ) µG, i.e. ∼100 times larger than <lb/>typical interstellar medium (ISM) values. <lb/>Such a large amplified magnetic field disfa-<lb/>vors the IC interpretation of the VHE data. <lb/>Furthermore, in the remnant HESS J1834−087 <lb/>the maximum of the extended VHE emission <lb/>correlates with a maximum in the density of a <lb/>nearby molecular cloud (Albert et al. 2006a) <lb/>– which suggests hadronic illumination of the <lb/>target molecular cloud. <lb/>MAGIC observed the shell-type supernova <lb/>remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A during 47 good-<lb/>quality hours, and detected a point-like source <lb/>of VHE γ-rays above ∼250 GeV (Albert et <lb/>al. 2007a). The measured spectrum is con-<lb/>sistent with a power law with a differential <lb/>flux at 1 TeV of (1.0±0.1 stat  ±0.3  sys ) × 10 <lb/> −12 <lb/> TeV <lb/> −1  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  and a photon index of Γ = <lb/> 2.4 ± 0.2 stat  ± 0.2 sys . The spectrum measured <lb/>by MAGIC is consistent with that measured <lb/>by HEGRA about 8 years before (Aharonian et <lb/>al. 2001) where they overlap, i.e. at E ∼ &gt; 1 TeV. <lb/>VHE data seem to favor a hadronic scenario for <lb/>the γ-ray production, since a leptonic origin of <lb/>the TeV emission would require low magnetic <lb/>field intensities, which is in principle difficult <lb/>to reconcile with the high values required to <lb/>explain the rest of the broad-band spectrum. <lb/>However, current hadronic models (Berezhko <lb/>et al. 2003) predict for the 0.1–1 TeV region a <lb/>harder spectrum than then measured one. <lb/>MAGIC detected a new source of VHE <lb/> γ-rays located close to the Galactic Plane, <lb/>namely MAGIC J0616+225 (Albert et al. <lb/>2007b), which is spatially coincident with the <lb/>SNR IC 443. The measured energy spectrum <lb/>is well fitted (χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ν  = 1.1) by the following <lb/>power law: <lb/> d <lb/> 3  N <lb/> dE dA dt  = (1.0 ± 0.2 stat  ± 0.3 sys ) × <lb/> 10 <lb/> −11  (E/0.4 TeV) <lb/> −3.1±0.3  stat  ±0.2  sys TeV <lb/> −1  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  . <lb/>MAGIC J0616+225 is point-like for MAGIC&apos;s <lb/>spatial resolution, and appears displaced to <lb/>the south of the center of the SNR shell, and <lb/>correlated with a nearby molecular cloud <lb/>and with the location of maser emission. An <lb/>EGRET source, too, is centered on the SNR <lb/>shell. The observed VHE γ-rays may be due <lb/>to π <lb/> 0 -decays from interactions of cosmic rays <lb/>accelerated in IC 443 and the dense molecular <lb/>cloud. The distance of this cloud from IC 443 <lb/>could explain the steepness of the measured <lb/>VHE γ-ray spectrum. <lb/> 3.3. Wolf-Rayet binaries <lb/> WR stars display some of the strongest sus-<lb/>tained winds among galactic objects with ter-<lb/>minal velocities reaching up to v  ∞  &gt; 1000 − <lb/> 5000 km s <lb/> −1  and also one of the highest known <lb/>mass loss rate ˙ <lb/> M ∼ 10 <lb/> −4 − 10 <lb/> −5  M   yr <lb/> −1  . <lb/>Colliding winds of binary systems containing <lb/>a WR star are considered as potential sites of <lb/>non-thermal high-energy photon production, <lb/>via leptonic and/or hadronic process after ac-<lb/>celeration of primary particles in the collision <lb/>shock. Two objects of this kind, WR 147 and <lb/>WR 146, were observed by MAGIC (Aliu et <lb/>al. 2008a) for 30.3 and 44.5 effective hours, re-<lb/>spectively. No evidence for VHE γ-ray emis-<lb/>sion was detected in either case, and upper <lb/>limits to the emission of 1.5%, 1.4%, and <lb/>1.7% (WR 147) and 5.0%, 3.5%, and 1.2% <lb/>(WR 146) of Crab units were derived for lower <lb/></body>

			<body> energy cuts of 80, 200, and 600 GeV, respec-<lb/>tively. <lb/> 3.4. Compact binaries: Cygnus X-1 and <lb/>LS I +61 303 <lb/> In both SNRs and PWNe particle accelera-<lb/>tion proceeds on the parsec distance scales <lb/>in the shocks formed in interactions of ei-<lb/>ther SN ejecta or pulsar winds with the ISM. <lb/>A different population of much more com-<lb/>pact particle accelerators, which has been re-<lb/>vealed by current IACTs, is formed by the <lb/>TeV binaries (TVBs). These systems contain <lb/>a compact object –either a neutron star (NS) <lb/>or a black hole (BH)– that accretes, or in-<lb/>teracts with, matter outflowing from a com-<lb/>panion star: hence they are VHE-loud X-ray <lb/>binaries (XRBs). Four TVBs have been de-<lb/>tected so far: PSR B1259−63 (Aharonian et <lb/>al. 2005a), LS 5039 (Aharonian et al. 2005b, <lb/>2006e), LS I +61 303 (Albert et al. 2006b), and <lb/>Cyg X-1 (Albert et al. 2007d). <lb/>Cygnus X-1 is the best established candi-<lb/>date for a stellar mass BH and one of the <lb/>brightest X-ray sources in the sky. MAGIC ob-<lb/>served it for 40 hours along 26 different nights <lb/>between June and November 2006. These ob-<lb/>servations imposed the first limits to the steady <lb/> γ-ray emission from this object, ∼ <lb/> &lt; 1% of the <lb/>Crab nebula flux above ∼500 GeV, and ob-<lb/>tained a very strong evidence (4.1 σ post-trial <lb/>significance) of a short-lived, intense flaring <lb/>episode during 24 September 2006, in coin-<lb/>cidence with a historically high flux observed <lb/>in X-rays (Malzac et al. 2008) and during the <lb/>maximum of the ∼326 d super-orbital modula-<lb/>tion (Rico 2008). The detected signal is point-<lb/>like, consistent with the position of Cygnus X-<lb/>1, and excludes the nearby radio nebula pow-<lb/>ered by the relativistic jet. <lb/>LS I +61 303 is a peculiar binary system <lb/>composed of a compact object (NS or BH) <lb/>and a Be star in a highly eccentric orbit, <lb/>which displays periodic emission throughout <lb/>the spectrum from radio to X-ray frequencies. <lb/>MAGIC observations have determined that this <lb/>object produces γ-rays up to at least ∼4 TeV <lb/>(Albert et al. 2006b), and that the emission is <lb/>periodically modulated by the orbital motion <lb/>(P TeV  = (26.8 ± 0.2) d) (Albert et al. 2009). <lb/>The peak of the emission is found always at <lb/>orbital phases φ  0.6 − 0.7. During December <lb/>2006 a secondary peak was detected at φ <lb/> 0.8 − 0.9. In October-November 2006, a multi-<lb/> ν campaign was carried out that involved radio <lb/>(VLBA, e-EVN, MERLIN), X-ray (Chandra) <lb/>and VHE γ-ray (MAGIC) instruments (Albert <lb/>et al. 2008c), which excluded the existence <lb/>of large scale (∼0.1 <lb/>  ) persistent radio-jets and <lb/>found a possible hint of a temporal X-ray/TeV <lb/>correlation. <lb/> 3.5. Crab nebula and pulsar <lb/> The Crab nebula, a steady emitter that is used <lb/>as a calibration candle, has been observed ex-<lb/>tensively from the radio up to ∼70 TeV. A large <lb/>fraction of MAGIC observation time is devoted <lb/>to this object. Out of it, 16 hours of optimal <lb/>data were used to measure the 0.06–8 TeV en-<lb/>ergy spectrum (Albert et al. 2008a). The peak <lb/>of the spectral energy distribution (SED) has <lb/>been measured at an energy E = (77±35) GeV. <lb/>The VHE source is point-like and the position <lb/>coincides with that of the pulsar. <lb/>Discrimination between different processes <lb/>of pulsar magnetospheric emission (e.g., polar-<lb/>cap vs outer-gap scenario) is one clear goal of <lb/>VHE astrophysics. Polar-cap (e.g., Daugherty <lb/>&amp; Harding 1982, 1996) and outer-gap (e.g., <lb/>Cheng et al. 1986; Romani 1996) models es-<lb/>sentially differ by the location of the gap in the <lb/>pulsar magnetosphere. In the former case this <lb/>is close to the NS surface, whereas in the latter <lb/>it is further away from it. Thus, the influence of <lb/>the magnetic field (B ∼ 10 <lb/> 11−13 G) is crucially <lb/>different in these models. In polar-cap models, <lb/>it produces absorption (due to γ+B →e <lb/> ±  ) lead-<lb/>ing to a super-exponential cutoff of the emis-<lb/>sion (mostly curvature radiation). In outer-gap <lb/>models, only a (milder) exponential cutoff is <lb/>present, and the highest photon energies de-<lb/>pend on the electron energy. <lb/>Quite recently, thanks to a special trig-<lb/>ger setup, MAGIC detected statistically signif-<lb/>icant (6.4 σ) &lt;25 GeV pulsed emission from <lb/>the Crab pulsar (Aliu et al. 2008b). That re-<lb/>sult revealed a relatively high energy cutoff, <lb/>indicating that the Crab pulsar&apos;s γ-ray emis-<lb/></body>

			<body> sion occurs far out in the magnetosphere, hence <lb/>excluding the polar-cap scenario for the VHE <lb/>emission of the Crab pulsar. This is the first <lb/>time that a pulsed γ-ray emission is detected <lb/>from a ground-based telescope, and opens up <lb/>the possibility of a systematic study of pulsar <lb/>emission cutoffs, knowledge of which will help <lb/>clarify the mechanism and region of produc-<lb/>tion of VHE radiation in pulsars. <lb/> 3.6. Galactic center <lb/> The possibility of indirect dark matter detec-<lb/>tion through its annihilation into VHE γ-rays <lb/> has aroused interest to observe the Galactic <lb/>Center (GC). H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observed <lb/>the GC, measuring a steady flux consistent <lb/>with a differential power-law slope of ∼2.2, <lb/> up to energies of ∼20 TeV with no cutoff <lb/>(Aharonian et al. 2004; Albert et al. 2006c). <lb/>Within the error circle of the measurement of <lb/>the central source HESS J1745-290 are three <lb/>compelling candidates for the origin of the <lb/>VHE emission: the shell-type SNR Sgr A East, <lb/>the newly discovered PWN G 359.95−0.04, <lb/>and the putative massive BH Sgr A <lb/>  itself. <lb/>Plausible radiation mechanisms include IC <lb/>scattering of energetic electrons, the decay of <lb/>pions produced in the interactions of energetic <lb/>hadrons with the ISM or dense radiation fields, <lb/>and curvature radiation of UHE protons close <lb/>to Sgr A <lb/>  . These considerations disfavor DM <lb/>annihilation as the main origin of the detected <lb/>flux, whereas a more conventional astrophys-<lb/>ical mechanism is likely to be at work (e.g., <lb/>Aharonian et al. 2006f). Furthermore, the lack <lb/>of flux variability on hour/day/year timescales <lb/>suggests that particle acceleration occurs in a <lb/>steady object, such as a SNR or a PWN, and <lb/>not in the central BH. <lb/>The GC diffuse emission correlates with <lb/>molecular clouds and suggests an enhanced <lb/>CR spectrum in the Galactic center (Aharonian <lb/>et al. 2006g). Its morphology and spectrum <lb/>suggest recent in situ CR acceleration: because <lb/>the photon indexes of the diffuse emission and <lb/>of the central source HESS J1745-290 are sim-<lb/>ilar, the latter source could be the accelerator <lb/>in question. <lb/> 4. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) <lb/> Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are be-<lb/>lieved to reside in the cores of most galaxies. <lb/>The fueling of SMBHs by infalling matter pro-<lb/>duces the spectacular activity observed in ac-<lb/>tive galactic nuclei (AGNs). <lb/>The current AGN paradigm includes a cen-<lb/>tral engine, most likely a SMBH, surrounded <lb/>by an accretion disk and by fast-moving <lb/>clouds, which emit Doppler-broadened lines <lb/>(Urry &amp; Padovani 1995). In ∼10% of all <lb/>AGNs, the infalling matter turns on powerful <lb/>collimated jets that shoot out from the SMBH <lb/>in opposite directions, likely perpendicular to <lb/>the disk, at relativistic speeds. <lb/>If a relativistic jet is viewed at small an-<lb/>gle to its axis the observed jet emission is <lb/>amplified by relativistic beaming and domi-<lb/>nates the observed emission. Such sources are <lb/>called blazars. Given the blazars&apos; compact-<lb/>ness (as suggested by their short variability <lb/>timescales), all GeV/TeV photons would be <lb/>absorbed through pair-producing γγ collisions <lb/>with target X-ray/IR photons. Beaming en-<lb/>sures the intrinsic radiation density to be much <lb/>smaller than the observed one, so that γ-ray <lb/> photons encounter a much lower γγ opacity <lb/>and hence manage to leave the source: revers-<lb/>ing the argument, γ-ray detection is a proof of <lb/>strongly anisotropic (e.g., beamed) emission. <lb/>The SEDs of blazars are generally charac-<lb/>terized by two broad humps, peaking at, re-<lb/>spectively, IR/X-ray and GeV-TeV frequencies <lb/>(Ulrich et al. 1997). The mainstream inter-<lb/>pretation of the blazars SEDs is synchrotron-<lb/>Compton emission, i.e. synchrotron emission <lb/>(peaked in the IR/X-ray range) from a time-<lb/>varying population of ultra-relativistic elec-<lb/>trons moving in a strong magnetic field, <lb/>and IC emission (peaked in the ∼100 MeV– <lb/>100 GeV range) from soft photons scatter-<lb/>ing off energetic electrons. Depending on <lb/>the relative efficiency of the relativistic par-<lb/>ticles&apos; cooling through scattering with pho-<lb/>ton fields that are internal to jet or exter-<lb/>nal to it, the synchrotron and Compton com-<lb/>ponents peak at, respectively, UV/X-ray and <lb/>GeV–TeV energies (synchrotron-self-Compton <lb/>[SSC] scheme: e.g., Maraschi et al. 1992) or at <lb/></body>

			<body> IR/optical and MeV–GeV energies (external-<lb/>IC [EIC] scheme, see Dermer &amp; Schlickeiser <lb/>1993). Hybrid SSC/EIC models have also been <lb/>proposed (Ghisellini 1999). Alternative mod-<lb/>els of VHE emission involve, e.g., two electron <lb/>populations, one –primary– accelerated within <lb/>the jet and the other –secondary– generated <lb/>by electromagnetic cascades initiated by pri-<lb/>mary protons/nuclei that had been accelerated <lb/>in the jet (Mannheim 1993); or a population of <lb/>extremely energetic protons emitting by syn-<lb/>chrotron radiation (Aharonian 2000). <lb/>The emitting particles are accelerated <lb/>within the relativistic jets which transport en-<lb/>ergy from the central SMBH outwards (Rees <lb/>1967). The X-ray and γ-ray emission, with its <lb/>extremely fast and correlated multi-frequency <lb/>variability, indicates that often a single region <lb/>dominates the emission. <lb/>Blazar observations have been a top prior-<lb/>ity for VHE astrophysics ever since the dis-<lb/>covery of TeV emission from Mkn 421 (Punch <lb/>et al. 1992). In fact, VHE data are of crucial <lb/>importance to constrain, and perhaps to close, <lb/>the SSC model. Even in the simplest one-zone <lb/>SSC model of blazar emission, knowledge of <lb/>the whole SED up to the VHE regime is re-<lb/>quired for a complete description of the emit-<lb/>ting electrons&apos; distribution and environment <lb/>(e.g., Tavecchio et al. 1998). However, accurate <lb/>knowledge of blazar emission mechanism(s) <lb/>requires simultaneous broadband γ-ray and X-<lb/>ray (i.e., IC and synchrotron) data. In fact, a <lb/>simultaneous SED can act as a snapshot of the <lb/>emitting population of particles at a given time. <lb/>In the following we describe a few selected <lb/>items from MAGIC&apos;s recent activity in AGN <lb/>physics. <lb/> 4.1. The July 2005 flares of Mkn 501 <lb/> MAGIC observed the bright and variable VHE <lb/> γ-ray emitter Mkn 501 during six weeks in <lb/>summer 2005 (Albert et al. 2007c). In two of <lb/>the observation nights, the recorded flux (&gt; 4× <lb/>that of the Crab nebula) revealed rapid changes <lb/>with doubling times ∼ &lt; 3 min. For the first time, <lb/>short (∼20 min) VHE γ-ray flares with a re-<lb/>solved time structure could be used for de-<lb/>tailed studies of particle acceleration and cool-<lb/>ing timescales. <lb/>Interestingly the flares in the two nights be-<lb/>have differently: while the 2005 June 30 flare <lb/>is only visible at energies 0.25–1.2 TeV, the <lb/>2005 July 9 flare is conspicuous in all energy <lb/>bands (120 GeV to &gt;1.2 TeV). A photon-by-<lb/>photon analysis of the July 9 flare (Albert et <lb/>al. 2008d) revealed a time delay between the <lb/>flare peak at different energies: at a zero-delay <lb/>probability of p = 0.026, a marginal time de-<lb/>lay of τ  l  = (0.030 ± 0.012) s GeV <lb/> −1  towards <lb/>higher energies was found using two indepen-<lb/>dent analyses, both exploiting the full statisti-<lb/>cal power of the dataset. Several explanations <lb/>for this delay may be considered. We men-<lb/>tion here an energy-dependent speed of pho-<lb/>tons in vacuum, as predicted in some models <lb/>of quantum gravity where Lorentz invariance <lb/>violation (LIV) is a manifestation of the foamy <lb/>structure of space-time at short distances. Such <lb/>LIV could manifest themselves in modifica-<lb/>tions of the propagation of energetic particles, <lb/>i.e. a non-trivial dispersion relation (Amelino-<lb/>Camelia et al. 1998). <lb/>The dependence of the speed of light on <lb/>the photon energy E can be parameterized as <lb/> c <lb/>  = c [1±(E/E S1 )±(E/E S2 ) <lb/> 2  ±...] . The energy <lb/>scales E  S1 , E  S2 are usually expressed in units <lb/>of the Planck mass, M  P  ≡ 1.22 × 10 <lb/> 19 GeV/c <lb/> 2 . <lb/>If the linear term dominates, then c <lb/>  = c [1 ± <lb/> (E/E S1 )] . A favored way to search for such <lb/>a dispersion relation is to compare the arrival <lb/>times of photons of different energies arriv-<lb/>ing to Earth from pulses of distant astrophys-<lb/>ical sources. Assuming a simultaneous emis-<lb/>sion of the γ-rays (of different energies) at the <lb/>Mkn 501 site, a formal value of E S 1 can be in-<lb/>ferred. However, since it is not possible to ex-<lb/>clude that the observed delay is due to some <lb/>conventional astrophysical effect at the source, <lb/>only a lower limit of E S 1  &gt; 0.21 × 10 <lb/> 18 GeV <lb/>(95% c.l.) can be established (Albert et al. <lb/>2008d). <lb/> 4.2.

			<body> derstanding of blazar emission. A num-<lb/>ber of multi-ν campaigns have been carried <lb/>out on known northern-hemisphere blazars, <lb/>that involved space-borne telescopes (Suzaku, <lb/> Swift, Chandra, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL) <lb/> and ground-based IACTs (Whipple, H.E.S.S., <lb/>MAGIC, and VERITAS) and optical and radio <lb/>telescopes. <lb/>The observations of Mkn 501 in July 2006 <lb/>revealed the lowest X-ray (with Suzaku) and <lb/>VHE state ever observed: no variability in <lb/>VHE γ-rays was found, while an overall in-<lb/>crease of about 50% during one day was seen <lb/>in X-rays; a one-zone SSC mode describes this <lb/>quiescent state of Mkn 501 well (Anderhub et <lb/>al. 2009a). <lb/>Coordinated observations of OJ 287 car-<lb/>ried out in April and November 2007 by the <lb/>Nobeyama millimiter array, the KANATA op-<lb/>tical telescope, the X-ray telescope Suzaku, <lb/> and MAGIC captured the source in quiescent <lb/>and flaring state respectively. According to a <lb/>simple SSC model, the spectral variations ob-<lb/>served between the quiescent and the active <lb/>phase are due to an increase in the energy <lb/>density of the emitting electrons with small <lb/>changes of both the magnetic field and the <lb/>electrons&apos; maximum Lorentz factor (Seta et al. <lb/>2009). <lb/>Mkn 421 was observed together with <lb/> XMM-Newton, VERITAS, and Whipple in <lb/>April 2006 and May 2008 to probe multiband <lb/>variability (Acciari et al. 2009a). A more re-<lb/>cent observation of a flare of Mkn 421 in sum-<lb/>mer 2008 could be followed accurately from <lb/>optical to VHE γ rays, with the participation of <lb/> AGILE, GASP-WEBT, VERITAS and MAGIC <lb/>(Donnarumma et al. 2009). <lb/>A <lb/>coordinated <lb/>observation <lb/>of <lb/>1ES 1959+650 was carried out in May <lb/>2006 when the source was simultaneously <lb/>in a historical minimum in VHE γ-rays and <lb/>relatively high in the optical and X-ray bands <lb/>(Tagliaferri et al. 2008). <lb/> 4.3. Blazars detected during optical <lb/>outbursts <lb/> MAGIC has been performing target of oppor-<lb/>tunity observations upon high optical states <lb/>of known or potential VHE blazars. Up to <lb/>now, this strategy has proven very successful <lb/>with the discovery of Mkn 180 (Albert et al. <lb/>2006e), 1ES 1011+496 (Albert et al. 2007e), <lb/>and S5 0716+71 (Anderhub et al. 2009b). <lb/>The 18.7-hr observation of 1ES 1011+496, <lb/>triggered by an optical outburst in March 2007, <lb/>resulted in a 6.2 σ detection at F  &gt;200 GeV  <lb/> 1.6 × 10 <lb/> −11  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  . An indication of an <lb/>optical–VHE correlation is given, in that in <lb/>spring 2007 the VHE γ-ray flux is &gt;40% <lb/> higher than in spring 2006, where MAGIC <lb/>observed the blazar as part of a systematic <lb/>search for VHE emission from a sample of X-<lb/>ray bright (F 1 keV  &gt; 2 µJy) HBLs (Albert et al. <lb/>2008e). <lb/>In April 2008, triggered by an opti-<lb/>cal flare, MAGIC observed S5 0716+71. The <lb/>6.8σ detection (in 2.6 hr) measured a flux of <lb/> F  &gt;400 GeV  ≈ 10 <lb/> −11  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  . <lb/> 4.4. The region of 3C 66A/B <lb/> MAGIC observed the region around the dis-<lb/>tant blazar 3C 66A for 54.2 hr in August– <lb/>December 2007 (Aliu et al. 2009b). The <lb/>observations resulted in the discovery of a <lb/> γ-ray source centered at celestial coordi-<lb/>nates RA = 2 <lb/> h 23 <lb/> m 12 <lb/> s and DEC= 43 <lb/> •  0. <lb/>  7 <lb/>(MAGIC J0223+430), coinciding in sky coor-<lb/>dinates with the nearby radio galaxy 3C 66B. <lb/>The energy spectrum of MAGIC J0223+430 <lb/>follows a power law with a normalization of <lb/>(1.7 ± 0.3 stat  ± 0.6 syst ) × 10 <lb/> −11  TeV <lb/> −1  cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1 <lb/> at 300 GeV and a photon index Γ = −3.10 ± <lb/> 0.31 stat  ±0.2  syst . The possible association of the <lb/>excess with the distant blazar 3C 66A and the <lb/>nearby radiogalaxy 3C 66B is discussed in Aliu <lb/>et al. (2009b). <lb/> 4.5. Detection of the flat-spectrum radio <lb/>quasar 3C 279 <lb/> Observations of 3C 279, the brightest EGRET <lb/>AGN, during the WEBT multi-ν campaign re-<lb/>vealed a post-trial 5.77 σ detection on 2006 <lb/>Feb. 23, supported by a marginal signal on the <lb/>previous night (Albert et al. 2008f).

			<body> be rejected on the 5.04 σ level. Simultaneous <lb/>optical R-band observations by the Tuorla <lb/>Observatory Blazar Monitoring Program re-<lb/>vealed that during the MAGIC observations the <lb/>optical flux of the source was about twice the <lb/>long-term baseline flux – but with with no indi-<lb/>cation of short time-scale variability at optical <lb/>frequencies. The observed VHE spectrum can <lb/>be described by a power law with a differential <lb/>photon spectral index of Γ = 4.1±0.7 stat  ±0.2  syst <lb/> between 75 and 500 GeV. The measured flux <lb/>is F  100 GeV  = (5.15 ± 0.82 stat  ± 1.5 syst ) × 10 <lb/> −10 <lb/> cm <lb/> −2  s <lb/> −1  . <lb/>The detection of 3C 279 has extended the <lb/>test on the transparency of the universe to VHE <lb/> γ-rays out to z = 0.536 (see section 4.7). <lb/> 4.6. The Feb. 2008 flare of M 87 <lb/> The giant radio galaxy M 87, one of the best-<lb/>studied SMBH systems, has long been known <lb/>as a VHE γ-ray emitter (Aharonian et al. <lb/>2006h). To assess variability timescales and <lb/>the location of the VHE engine in M 87, <lb/>the H.E.S.S., VERITAS, and MAGIC collab-<lb/>orations carried out a shared monitoring of <lb/>M 87, resulting in ∼120 hr of observations in <lb/>2008 (Acciari et al. 2009b). On 2008 Feb. 1, <lb/>MAGIC observed an 8 σ signal (Albert et al. <lb/>2008g) and triggered observations from the <lb/>other IACTs as well as from Swift. MAGIC <lb/>measured, for the first time, the energy spec-<lb/>trum below 250 GeV, which can be described <lb/>by a power law with a spectral index Γ = <lb/> 2.30 ± 0.11 stat  ± 0.20 syst . <lb/>Our analysis revealed a variable (5.6 σ) <lb/> night-to-night γ-ray flux above 350 GeV, while <lb/>no variability was found for 150–350 GeV. <lb/>This fastest variability ∆t observed so far in <lb/>TeV γ-rays in M 87, while confirms the E &gt; <lb/> 730 GeV short-time variability reported earlier <lb/>(Aharonian et al. 2006h), is of the order of one <lb/>day or less. This restricts the emission region <lb/>to a size of R ≤ ∆t c δ = 2.6 × 10 <lb/> 15 cm = <lb/> 2.6 δ Schwarzschild radii (Doppler factor δ), <lb/> and suggests the core of M 87 rather than the <lb/>brightest known knot in the M 87 jet, HST-1, <lb/>as the origin of the TeV γ-rays. During the <lb/>MAGIC observations, HST-1 was at a histori-<lb/>cally low X-ray flux level, whereas at the same <lb/>time the core luminosity reached a historical <lb/>maximum. <lb/>This strongly supports the core of M 87 as <lb/>the VHE γ-ray emission region. The simulta-<lb/>neous strong increase of the radio flux from the <lb/>nucleus of M 87 provides further support to the <lb/>concept that the charged particles are acceler-<lb/>ated to VHEs in the immediate vicinity of the <lb/>BH (Acciari et al. 2009b). <lb/> 4.7. Intergalactic background light <lb/> One further aspect of TeV spectra of blazars <lb/>is that they can be used as probes of the <lb/>Intergalactic Background Light (IBL), i.e. the <lb/>integrated light arising from the evolving stel-<lb/>lar populations of galaxies (see Hauser &amp; <lb/>Dwek 2001). The TeV photons emitted by <lb/>a blazar interact with the IR/optical photons <lb/>of the IBL field and are likely absorbed via <lb/>pair production. Whatever its intrinsic shape <lb/>at emission, after travelling through the IBL-<lb/>filled space, a blazar spectrum will reach the <lb/>observer distorted by absorption. This effect, <lb/>which is stronger for more distant objects (e.g., <lb/>Stecker et al. 1992), is the most likely origin of <lb/>the avoidance zone (i.e., no flat spectra at high <lb/>redshift) in the observed spectral slope vs red-<lb/>shift plot. <lb/>Usually, either (i) the shape and intensity <lb/>of IBL(z) is assumed, and the VHE spectrum <lb/>is corrected before the SSC modeling is per-<lb/>formed (e.g., de Jager &amp; Stecker 2002; Kneiske <lb/>et al. 2004); or (ii) based on assumptions on <lb/>the intrinsic VHE spectrum, EBL(z) is solved <lb/>for: e.g., based on analysis of the observed hard <lb/>VHE spectra of the distant blazars 1ES 1101-<lb/>232 and H 2359-309, a low EBL energy den-<lb/>sity at z ∼ &lt; 0.2 has been derived (Aharonian et <lb/>al. 2006i). The two approaches can be used <lb/>in combination to estimate the distance to the <lb/>VHE source (Mazin &amp; Goebel 2007). <lb/>The detection in VHE γ-rays of 3C 279 at <lb/> z = 0.536 provided us with a new opportu-<lb/>nity to check the transparency of the Universe <lb/>out to a relatively large redshift. Assuming <lb/>for 3C 279 a maximally flat intrinsic spectrum, <lb/>corresponding to Γ <lb/>  *  = 1.5 , a quite low upper <lb/>limit to the IBL is inferred, consistent with the <lb/>light arising from pure galaxy counts.

Gamma-ray bursts <lb/> There is a prevailing consensus that the ba-<lb/>sic mechanism of GRB emission is an expand-<lb/>ing relativistic fireball (Rees &amp; Meszaros 1992, <lb/>Meszaros &amp; Rees 1993, Sari et al. 1998), with <lb/>the beamed radiation (δ∼O(10 <lb/> 2 ) due to inter-<lb/>nal/external shocks (prompt/afterglow phase, <lb/>respectively). If so, the emitting particles (elec-<lb/>trons and/or protons) are accelerated to very <lb/>high energies. In the fireball shock framework, <lb/>several models have predicted VHE emission <lb/>during both the prompt and afterglow phases <lb/>of the GRB (e.g., Meszaros 2006). <lb/>MAGIC observed part of the prompt-<lb/>emission phase of GRB 050713a as a response <lb/>to an alert by the Swift satellite (Albert et <lb/>al. 2006d). However, no excess at &gt;175 GeV <lb/>was detected, neither during the prompt emis-<lb/>sion phase nor later – but the upper limits <lb/>to the MAGIC flux are compatible with sim-<lb/>ple extrapolations of the Swift Γ1.6 power-<lb/>law spectrum to hundreds of GeV. In general, <lb/>however, the cosmological distances of these <lb/>sources prevent VHE detection because of IBL <lb/>absorption: the average redshift of the GRBs <lb/>for which MAGIC was alerted (and whose z <lb/> are known) is ¯ <lb/> z=3.22, whereas at 70 GeV the <lb/>cosmological γ-ray horizon is z∼1. <lb/> One exceptional, but unfortunately missed, <lb/>opportunity was GRB 080319B, nicknamed <lb/> &quot; naked-eye GRB &quot; on account of its exception-<lb/>ally high peak optical flux (m v  = 5.3; Racusin <lb/>et al. 2008): according to (post factum) theo-<lb/>retical predictions of its intrinsic emission and <lb/>owing to its relatively low redshft (z = 0.937) <lb/>its VHE flux would have been detectable by <lb/>current IACTs (Kumar &amp; Panaitescu 2008; <lb/>Zou et al. 2009). However, by the time of its <lb/>occurrence dawn was approaching the MAGIC <lb/>site so the telescope was closing down lest the <lb/>photomultipliers could be severely damaged by <lb/>excessive sunlight. So this unique event was <lb/>missed. <lb/> 6. Dark matter <lb/> Evidence for departure of cosmological mo-<lb/>tions from the predictions of Newtonian dy-<lb/>namics based on visible matter, interpreted as <lb/>due to the the presence of DM, are well estab-<lb/>lished – from galaxy scales (e.g., van Albada et <lb/>al. 1985) to galaxy-cluster scales (e.g., Sarazin <lb/>1986) to cosmological scales (e.g., Spergel et <lb/>al. 2003). <lb/>DM particle candidates should be weakly <lb/>interacting with ordinary matter (and hence <lb/>neutral). The theoretically favored ones, which <lb/>are heavier than the proton, are dubbed <lb/>weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). <lb/>WIMPs should be long-lived enough to have <lb/>survived from their decoupling from radiation <lb/>in the early universe into the present epoch. <lb/>WIMPs could be detected indirectly, by <lb/>their self-annihilation products in high-density <lb/>DM environments. DM annihilation can gen-<lb/>erate γ-rays through several processes. Most <lb/>relevant in the present context, a continuum <lb/> γ-ray spectrum can be produced through the <lb/>fragmentation and cascades of most other an-<lb/>nihilation products. The best observational tar-<lb/>gets for DM detection are nearby high-M/L <lb/>objects with little or no ongoing star forma-<lb/>tion, which are also expected to have the high-<lb/>est central densities known in galactic halos. <lb/>Objects meeting these requirements are the <lb/>Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies <lb/>(e.g., Draco, Sculptor, Fornax, Carina, Sextans, <lb/>Ursa Minor). A further issue concerns the <lb/>shape of the inner halo profile, i.e. whether the <lb/>latter is cuspy or cored. <lb/>These considerations (and uncertainties) <lb/>have been incorporated in detailed predictions <lb/>of the γ-ray flux expected from the annihila-<lb/>tion of the neutralino pairs in Galactic dwarf <lb/>spheroidal galaxies: the outlooks however sug-<lb/>gest that detection by current IACTs is un-<lb/>likely unless an implausibly halo clumpiness <lb/>boosts the annihilation signal by several orders <lb/>of magnitude (e.g., Bringmann et al. 2009). <lb/>No evidence of DM annihilation γ-rays <lb/> has been unambiguously claimed so far. An <lb/>apparently extended signal from the direc-<lb/>tion of NGC 253 (based on CANGAROO-<lb/>III data) has been definitely interpreted as <lb/></body>
