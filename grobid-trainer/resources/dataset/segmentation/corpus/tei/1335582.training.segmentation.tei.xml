Given that a ~20-25% discrepancy <lb/>has been measured between the extrapolated 10 <lb/>bunches peak luminosity and the standard fill pattern <lb/>(~100 bunches) one, it is necessary to investigate what <lb/>really happens and why. Letting apart the trivial case <lb/>of measurement non-linearity or saturation in KLOE, <lb/>used as precision luminosity monitor, new diagnostic <lb/>techniques are needed. A new diagnostics tools, based <lb/>on infrared time resolved multi-pixels detector and <lb/>funded by CSNV of INFN is under test at LNF to help <lb/>this analysis. <lb/></front>

			<body> I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Electron and positron beams stored in last generation <lb/>circular accelerators, both used as light sources and as <lb/>colliders, need power diagnostics systems to evaluate and <lb/>to characterize the behaviour of the stored charges. These <lb/>are gathered in bunches of the order of 10^9 – 10^13 <lb/>particles showing usually shapes that in first <lb/>approximation are Gaussian in the three dimensions. The <lb/>bunches run through the vacuum chamber at light speed <lb/>in h equilibrium points (called buckets) to maintain the <lb/>synchronous phase with the strong RF (radio frequency) <lb/>sinusoidal fields restoring every turn the lost beam <lb/>energy. The h number is called harmonic and it is given <lb/>by the ratio between the RF frequency and the ring <lb/>revolution frequency. <lb/>Many diagnostics systems allow the accelerator <lb/>physicists to check the beam performance driving the <lb/>working conditions towards the desired goals in terms of <lb/>e-/e+ total stored currents, beam shapes and dimensions, <lb/>transverse and longitudinal positions. Toroidal magnetic <lb/>tools, electrostatic pickups, electromagnetic striplines or <lb/>cavities, and synchrotron light monitors are the usual and <lb/>in large part commercial devices used to know how many <lb/>charges are in the ring, how they are distributed in the <lb/>buckets, how much the bunches are unstable or <lb/>misshaped for coupled bunch oscillations due to <lb/>Coulomb&apos;s force and ring vacuum chamber impedance. <lb/>The achievement of higher luminosity for the colliders <lb/>or lower emittance for the synchrotron light source, <lb/>needs to control at the best the beam characteristics and <lb/>to identify any not foreseen behaviours. The diagnostics <lb/>role is hence fundamental and always new tools need to <lb/>be planned and put under investigations to follow the <lb/>accelerator physicist requests. Furthermore it is important <lb/>to note that while the beam diagnostics is based on <lb/>turnkey and mature technologies, on the contrary the <lb/>bunch-by-bunch diagnostics has state-of-art applications <lb/>showing promising development perspective. <lb/>II. E-CLOUD INSTABILITY <lb/>Charged particles passing through bending or wiggler <lb/>magnets emit synchrotron light and the photons hitting <lb/>the vacuum chamber can extract ions and electrons from <lb/>the metal walls, made mostly by copper, aluminium, steel <lb/>or other alloys used as coating. In general the extracted <lb/>charged matter is harmful for the beams having opposite <lb/>sign charge, i.e. the positive charged ions for the electron <lb/>beams and the extracted electrons for positron or proton <lb/>stored beams. <lb/>The free ions tend to be trapped in the negative charged <lb/>bunches increasing the beam vertical size, that usually is <lb/>much smaller than the longitudinal or horizontal ones by <lb/>specifications. This effect is coped by using gaps (10-<lb/>20% of contiguous empty buckets), vacuum pumps and <lb/>clearing electrodes (that have the disadvantage to increase <lb/>the ring impedance). <lb/>The effect on the beams of the electrons extracted from <lb/>the metal walls is much more complicated and more <lb/>difficult to cope. First of all every vacuum chamber <lb/>surface type has a typical SEY (Secondary electron <lb/>Emission Yields) value describing the production <lb/>characteristics of the parasitic electron clouds that are <lb/>formed in these regions of the ring. As said above, while <lb/>for the negative charged stored particles the e-clouds are <lb/></body>

			<body> not a big issue because they produce repulsive forces, for <lb/>the positive charged beam, like positrons or protons, <lb/>instabilities can arise from the parasitic Coulomb&apos;s <lb/>attractive fields producing severe limitations to maintain <lb/>stored the particle beams. In order to limit and control the <lb/>e-cloud effects, many techniques have been developed as <lb/>well as many diagnostics tools to study the actual <lb/>performance of each techniques. The mitigation <lb/>techniques are mainly solenoidal fields, clearing <lb/>electrodes and sophisticated vacuum chamber coatings. <lb/>The diagnostics techniques are many and some of them <lb/>are discussed in the next paragraph. <lb/>III. THE DAFNE CASE <lb/>DAFNE is a F-factory, i.e. a circular accelerator <lb/>composed by electron-positron double main rings, a <lb/>LINAC, transfer lines and one accumulator ring. DAFNE <lb/>is located at Frascati and colliding at 1.02 GeV energy in <lb/>centre of mass [1]. See Fig. 1. below. <lb/>Fig. 1. DAFNE layout with the two IR beamlines <lb/>In DAFNE, powerful and extremely advanced bunch-<lb/>by-bunch feedback systems are used to control <lb/>destructive or harmful oscillations of the beams both in <lb/>the longitudinal and in the two transverse planes. The <lb/>feedback control is implemented by fast correction <lb/>signals applied to power amplifiers feeding stripline-type <lb/>or cavity-type kickers [2],[3]. <lb/>It is interesting to note that the instability growth rate <lb/>for each oscillation mode can be quickly evaluated by <lb/>using the bunch-by-bunch feedback systems. In particular <lb/>in DAFNE the more evident e-cloud effect is an <lb/>extremely fast horizontal instability [4] with grow rates of <lb/>the order of 20 microseconds or even less for the -1 mode <lb/>(resistive wall instability) as confirmed also by <lb/>simulations made by e-cloud models [5]. The feedback <lb/>systems are so powerful and efficient to be able to damp <lb/>in ~20 revolution turns, i.e. ~7 microseconds [6]. To get <lb/>this result the power applied usually is 500 W but in <lb/>some cases it has been 1000 W. <lb/>To limit the e-cloud effects in the positron ring, <lb/>solenoids have been installed around the straight sections <lb/>of the vacuum chamber and clearing electrodes have been <lb/>inserted inside the 8 bending magnets and in the 4 <lb/>wigglers where the synchrotron light hits stronger. <lb/>Fig. 2. Turning off the clearing electrodes a beam <lb/>vertical enlargement is evident on the SLM. <lb/>Diagnostics systems are necessary to verify and <lb/>evaluate the setup and the correct operation of solenoids <lb/>and electrodes, for example checking the best voltage <lb/>value to apply to the electrodes and with which polarity. <lb/>The voltage has been progressively increased up to 500 V <lb/>while the polarity, at the begin with attractive sign, is now <lb/>changed to the repulsive one. This is to avoid to have too <lb/>large parasitic currents towards the electrode power <lb/>supplies causing faults. <lb/>At DAFNE, up to now, the diagnostics used to monitor <lb/>solenoids and electrodes basically are [7],[8]: <lb/>a) standard SLM (synchrotron light monitor), <lb/>b) modal grow rate measurements, <lb/>c) bunch by bunch betatron tune spread along the <lb/>pattern train. <lb/>For the first diagnostics the SLM gives only beam <lb/>transverse sizes, enveloping all the bunch train, while the <lb/>last two measurements are bunch-by-bunch techniques <lb/>made by using the feedback capabilities. <lb/>The importance of these measurements is in the fact <lb/>that a vertical enlargement can be also produced for the <lb/>positron beam by the e-cloud effect (observed by the <lb/>SLM turning off the clearing electrodes, see Fig. 2.). A <lb/>beam vertical enlargement of course decreases the peak <lb/>luminosity as intuitively and analytically it can be argued. <lb/>The betatron tune spread along the bunch train can be <lb/>easily observed by using the feedback diagnostic <lb/>capabilities in the two transverse planes of the positron <lb/>beam, while it is negligible for the electron beam. See in <lb/>the Fig.3 the horizontal tune spread with the clearing <lb/>electrodes turned off, and in the Fig.4. the same measure <lb/>with the electrodes turned on. Both measurements are <lb/>done at about 600 mA beam current. In the first case the <lb/>spread is 0.008 while in the second it is reduced to 0.004. <lb/>Given that the betatron tune are carefully chosen to get <lb/>the higher peak luminosity it is clear that, larger is the <lb/></body>

			<body> tune spread, minor is the total peak luminosity. <lb/>IV. DAFNE LUMINOSITY <lb/>Beyond the e-cloud issue and the other beam <lb/>instabilities that can be classified as single beam <lb/>behaviours, DAFNE needs to solve also other problems <lb/>directly related to the luminosity, i.e. to the collision <lb/>intensity. Indeed many efforts are carrying on to achieve <lb/>higher peak luminosity for the KLOE detector, that takes <lb/>data from collisions at 1.02 GeV energy. In the last years <lb/>the crab-waist [9] technique has been implemented in the <lb/>interaction region. Basically this is done by focussing the <lb/>two beams by a couple of very strong sextupole magnets <lb/>for each ring to obtain a higher peak luminosity. This <lb/>technique has lead to very good results in the past for the <lb/>Siddartha detector achieving &gt;4*10^32 cm <lb/> -2 <lb/> s <lb/> -1 <lb/> peak <lb/>luminosity. The same result for KLOE detector still has <lb/>not been gotten but the work is in progress. <lb/>Indeed not only the peak luminosity is lower by a factor <lb/>&gt;2, but there is also a 20-25% discrepancy that has been <lb/>measured between the 10 bunches peak luminosity <lb/>(extrapolated) and the standard fill pattern (~100 <lb/>bunches) one, so it is necessary to investigate what really <lb/>happens and why. More exactly the peak luminosity (July <lb/>2014) has been 2*10^31 cm <lb/> -2 <lb/> s <lb/> -1 <lb/> for 10 bunches and <lb/>1.7*10^32 cm <lb/> -2 <lb/> s <lb/> -1 <lb/> for 100 bunches. <lb/>Fig. 3. Horizontal e+ tune spread versus bunch <lb/>number with clearing electrodes turned off and <lb/>~600mA beam current.. The spread is 0.008 <lb/>Letting apart the trivial case of a non-linearity or a <lb/>saturation of KLOE detector measurement system, that <lb/>however should carefully checked, new studies can be <lb/>planned. Furthermore KLOE is used as precision <lb/>luminosity monitor because this is the best that can be <lb/>done at DAFNE but what really would be useful to <lb/>understand the luminosity discrepancy should be a <lb/>precision bunch-by-bunch luminosity monitor that <lb/>unfortunately is not still available. Indeed if the <lb/>luminosity lack could be correlated to the e-cloud effects <lb/>as vertical enlargements or betatron tune spread, because <lb/>distributed with the same tendency along the positron <lb/>bunch train, this would be extremely useful to clarify the <lb/>problem and to try to fix it. <lb/>Moreover also the vertical position for each bunch of <lb/>the two beams need to be measured because it cannot be <lb/>excluded that the vertical enveloped measured size has a <lb/>component given by vertical position shift beyond shape <lb/>variation along the bunch train. <lb/>Fig. 4. Horizontal e+ tune spread versus bunch <lb/>number with clearing electrodes turned on and <lb/>~600mA beam current. The spread is 0.004 <lb/>The question is: how to discover these not foreseen <lb/>behaviours? <lb/>In this paper an innovative diagnostic tool, working <lb/>bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn is presented together <lb/>with some preliminary measurements made at DAFNE <lb/>by using it. In particular an experiment, called 3L_2D and <lb/>including this innovative detection system, has been <lb/>funded by the CSNV (Commissione Scientifica <lb/>Nazionale V) of INFN for the years 2013-14. The 3L-2D <lb/>experiment has the goal to study the beam behaviour in <lb/>terms of position and size and especially but not only in <lb/>presence of electron cloud effects. <lb/>The importance of this study is evident, as said above, <lb/>from the DAFNE e+ SLM data showing that the e-cloud <lb/>density increasing produces vertical enlargements of the <lb/>bunches (Fig. 2.) and bringing, as consequence, to a <lb/>luminosity decrease. What is not clear is how the <lb/>enlargement is distributed along the bunch train and how <lb/>it depends by the stored pattern. Furthermore it must be <lb/>underlined that the 3L_2D detector can give vertical <lb/>position information for each bunch that can be useful <lb/>also for the electron beam. Indeed a partial bad overlap <lb/>for only few bunches at the interaction point could be <lb/>another source of luminosity lack. It can be noted that the <lb/>regular DAFNE orbit monitor gives an average orbit with <lb/></body>

			<body> a refresh of only 7 Hz and cannot be used for the goal. <lb/>In conclusion the 3L_2D detector can hence help to <lb/>explain the luminosity discrepancy found showing both <lb/>vertical position and vertical enlargement for each bunch. <lb/>V. INFRARED UNCOOLED DETECTORS <lb/>As well known, the synchrotron light is the most <lb/>common radiation field applied to beam diagnostics. <lb/>There are classic techniques to measure the dimensions of <lb/>cross section of the beam from the image of SR emission <lb/>as well as to measure the angular spread of the particles <lb/>in the beam by direct emission observation [10]. From a <lb/>longitudinal point of view it is possible to measure the <lb/>bunch length by using a simple photo diode. Given that <lb/>the synchrotron radiation is spread in a large frequency <lb/>range, the light can be used for diagnostics by making <lb/>observations in the IR, visible, UV and X-ray. While for <lb/>high energy and ultra low emittance beams the X-ray and <lb/>UV detection is preferred, for relatively low energy <lb/>storage rings, like DAFNE rings, that are working at 510 <lb/>MeV, with beam transverse dimensions and emittance <lb/>that are not very small, infrared detectors can be used <lb/>fruitfully offering from some points of view the most <lb/>interesting choice. <lb/>The authors, in collaboration with the VIGO S.A., are <lb/>carrying on a research line to use HgCdTe uncooled <lb/>detectors working in the mid-infrared (~10 micron) with <lb/>a rise time &lt; 1ns. In particular the experiment wants to <lb/>use HgCdTe semiconductors as diagnostics tool to make <lb/>bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn measurements in the <lb/>longitudinal [11,12] and transverse [13] plane. <lb/>Fig. 5. The 2x32 pixel HgCdTe array detector by <lb/>VIGO S.A. The total area is 2x4 mm. <lb/>This low cost approach have to cope, from a <lb/>commercial point of view, with much more expensive <lb/>streak cameras for the longitudinal bunch length and with <lb/>synchrotron light monitors or gated cameras for <lb/>transverse measurements. Commercial SLM devices, that <lb/>work at frequencies around or below 100 Hz, can acquire <lb/>only the envelope of the beam and not the bunch-by-<lb/>bunch profile as for the 3L_2D experiment goal. <lb/>However also the expensive commercial gated cameras <lb/>still do not seem to have the needed capabilities in terms <lb/>of sampling clock that for DAFNE is 368 MHz. <lb/>Another key point for the experiment is the interest <lb/>about time resolved infrared detectors that is growing <lb/>since the development of uncooled compact <lb/>semiconductor devices with very fast response time that <lb/>can be used in many different fields, from astrophysics to <lb/>biomedical, from laser to particle beam diagnostics, as <lb/>well as for space and military purposes. <lb/>In this particular case, the IR time resolved detection <lb/>system of the 3L_2D experiment is designed for <lb/>investigations about e-cloud effects on the bunch-by-<lb/>bunch transverse dimensions in different filled patterns <lb/>by using the 3+L positron infrared beamline of DAFNE <lb/>and as consequence to study also the peak luminosity <lb/>lack described above. Measurements are also carried on <lb/>at SINBAD, the infrared beam line from the electron ring. <lb/>VI. APPARATUS DESCRIPTION <lb/>To use the HgCdTe semiconductors with the goal to the <lb/>beam data taking, a special dedicated apparatus has been <lb/>designed and built at LNF with great amplification and <lb/>large frequency range. <lb/>Fig. 6. The four analogue modules containing the <lb/>array and 2x16 channels of 3-stage amplification. <lb/>All boards are put inside a small box. <lb/>In particular the transverse bunch-by-bunch system is <lb/>built around the small semiconductor with 2x32 pixel <lb/>array producing very small signals of the order of tens of <lb/>microVolts. See Fig. 5. <lb/>To acquire the signal a special and very compact <lb/>camera has been built having 16 channels with 3-stage <lb/>amplification that gives &gt;40 dB gain, see in Fig. 6. <lb/>Sixteen amplified analogue signals are connected to <lb/>custom designed FPGA systems with 14 bit analogue to <lb/>digital converter. To acquire each pixel a programmable <lb/>modular timing board with 1 ps of rms jitter and 10 ps of <lb/>minimum step has been designed with 8 channels. See in <lb/>Fig. 7. The delay for each pixel is programmable by a <lb/></body>

CONCLUSION <lb/>An innovative diagnostics system has been presented in <lb/>this paper with some preliminary measurements done in <lb/>the last June. DAFNE really needs in the next run <lb/>answers and solutions to the not foreseen problems arisen <lb/>in the last runs with KLOE detector and the 3L_2D <lb/>experiment can help to solve them. <lb/></body>
