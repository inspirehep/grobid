			<body> I. INTRODUCTION <lb/> The study of novel topological phases of matter is an <lb/>extremely active research field <lb/> 1–3  . Quantum Spin Hall <lb/>Insulators (QSHI) are a remarkable example of topol-<lb/>ogy at work; in these two-dimensional insulating sys-<lb/>tems the non-dissipative spin current carried by gapless <lb/>edge states owes its robustness to the topology of bulk <lb/>bands described by the non-zero value of the Z  2  topo-<lb/>logical invariant. The two-dimensional graphene-like lat-<lb/>tice with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling has been identified <lb/>as a paradigmatic example of QSHI <lb/> 4–6  . The spin-orbit <lb/>helical interaction, described by a nearest-neighbor spin-<lb/>dependent complex hopping, opens a gap in the otherwise <lb/>linear spectrum of the honeycomb lattice and at the same <lb/>time induces a metallic behavior on the edges. <lb/>A band gap opening, the conditio sine qua non for the <lb/>emergence of topological features, can be achieved—at <lb/>least conceptually—in different ways, not all of them with <lb/>the same topological consequences. A gapped phase on <lb/>the honeycomb lattice may be induced by modulating the <lb/>tight-binding hopping amplitudes to describe different <lb/>kinds of bond dimerization or by including many-body <lb/> e-e interactions. The interplay between these three types <lb/>of &quot; gapping &quot; interactions—spin-orbit couplings, hopping <lb/>modulation and on-site e-e interaction—has been re-<lb/>cently studied assuming the bond dimerization that can <lb/>be associated to uniaxial strain <lb/> 7  . Another interesting <lb/>hopping modulation is the one leading to a Kekulé dis-<lb/>tortion where stronger and weaker nearest-neighbor links <lb/>alternate on the honeycomb lattice in a <lb/> √ <lb/> 3× <lb/> √ <lb/> 3 arrange-<lb/>ment. This structure turns out to be stable in the pres-<lb/>ence of nearest-neighbor and next-to-nearest-neighbor e-<lb/>e interactions <lb/> 8,9  resulting, at the mean field level, in an <lb/>effective bond dimerization of a Kekulé type. <lb/>In this work, we explore the combined effects of spin-<lb/>orbit couplings, hopping modulation and on-site e-e in-<lb/>teraction. We superimpose different kinds of hopping <lb/>modulation on a Kane-Mele-Hubbard model <lb/> 10–13  de-<lb/>scribing a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice in the pres-<lb/>ence of both spin-orbit coupling and local e-e interaction <lb/>and we identify the topological properties of this inter-<lb/>acting system in terms of topological invariants. This <lb/>will be done by solving the many-body problem within <lb/>Cluster Perturbation Theory (CPT) and extracting topo-<lb/>logical invariants from the many-body Green&apos;s function. <lb/>The goal is to clarify how the topological phases that <lb/>stem from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling are modified <lb/>by different kinds of hopping texturing and by e-e inter-<lb/>action. <lb/>The paper is organized as follows: in section II we con-<lb/>sider non-interacting electrons in the presence of intrinsic <lb/>spin-orbit coupling and different kinds of hopping mod-<lb/>ulation; section III extends the results to the interacting <lb/>case, and the last section is devoted to discussion and <lb/>conclusions. <lb/> II. SINGLE-PARTICLE DESCRIPTION <lb/> In the present section we consider a honeycomb model <lb/>of non-interacting electrons represented by a single par-<lb/>ticle hamiltonian with a spin-dependent hopping term <lb/>ˆ <lb/> H = <lb/> il,i   l   s <lb/> t  il,i   l   (s)ˆ c <lb/>  † <lb/> ils  <lb/>  i   l   s  . <lb/> (1) <lb/>Here i, i <lb/>  run over the atomic positions within the unit <lb/>cell, l, l <lb/>  refer to lattice vectors identifying the unit cells of <lb/>the lattice, and s =1,2 is for spin up and down. ˆ <lb/> c <lb/>  † <lb/> ils  and <lb/>  ils  are respectively the electron creation and electron <lb/>annihilation operators. The hopping term t  il,i   l   (s) in-<lb/>cludes both the first-neighbor spin-independent hopping <lb/>and the Haldane-Kane-Mele second-neighbor spin-orbit <lb/>coupling <lb/> 4,14  given by ıt  KM  s  z  (d  1  × d  2  )  z  , where d  1  and d  2 <lb/> are unit vectors along the two bonds that connect site <lb/> il with site i <lb/>  l <lb/>  , and s  z  is the unit vector in the direc-<lb/>tion orthogonal to the lattice plane. This hamiltonian <lb/></body>

			<body> preserves time-reversal symmetry and parity symmetry. <lb/>In turn, this implies that—by Kramer&apos;s theorem—states <lb/>come in time-reversal pairs and the Chern number com-<lb/>puted from the bulk occupied bands identically vanishes, <lb/>and so does the charge conductivity. However the spin-<lb/>conductivity may be non-vanishing as it depends upon <lb/>the difference between the two spin-filtered Chern num-<lb/>bers <lb/> 4  . <lb/>We start by considering the modulation in the hop-<lb/>ping amplitudes among nearest-neighboring sites that <lb/>may arise as a consequence of a non-uniform shear strain. <lb/>As shown in Ref. 15 this corresponds to different values <lb/>for the three nearest neighbor hopping parameters (Fig. <lb/>1 (a)). Since the system has time-reversal and inversion <lb/> t  1 <lb/> t 2 <lb/> t&apos; <lb/>t 3 <lb/> t <lb/> (a) <lb/>(b) <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2 <lb/> 3 <lb/> 4 <lb/> 5 <lb/> 6 <lb/> t KM <lb/> t&apos; KM <lb/> t KM <lb/> t&apos; KM <lb/> t&apos;&apos; KM <lb/> FIG. 1. <lb/>(Color online) Geometry of the two-dimensional <lb/>(2D) honeycomb lattice with different hopping texture: (a) <lb/>generalized dimerization with different nearest-neighbor hop-<lb/>ping parameters; (b) Kekulé distortion. The unit cells in the <lb/>two cases, containing two and six atoms respectively, are also <lb/>shown. Different values of second neighbor interactions are <lb/>indicated. <lb/> symmetry we may identify the topological character of <lb/>the system through the Z  2  parity invariant defined as <lb/>the exponent ∆ in the expression <lb/> 6 <lb/> (−1) <lb/> ∆  = <lb/> T RIM <lb/>N <lb/> n=1 <lb/> η  n  (Γ  i  ) . <lb/> (2) <lb/>where η  n  (Γ  i  ) = ±1 are the parity eigenvalues of the oc-<lb/>cupied bands for any of the two spin sectors, calculated <lb/>at time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM), and Γ  i  is <lb/>defined by the condition that −Γ  i  = Γ  i  + G with G a <lb/>reciprocal lattice vector. The value of the Z  2  topological <lb/>invariant distinguishes trivial insulators (∆ = 0, mod 2) <lb/>from topological QSH insulators (∆ = 1, mod 2). <lb/>The eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the honeycomb <lb/>lattice as well as the parity eigenvalues at TRIM points <lb/>can be easily calculated analytically in terms and hop-<lb/>ping parameters by solving the 2 × 2 secular problem; we <lb/>obtain <lb/> η  1  (Γ  1  ) = 1 <lb/> η  1  (Γ  2  ) = sign[t  1  + (t  2  − t  3  )] <lb/> η  1  (Γ  3  ) = sign[t  1  − (t  2  − t  3  )] <lb/> η  1  (Γ  4  ) = sign[t  1  − (t  2  + t  3  )] <lb/>where the t  i  are the three (generically different) hopping <lb/>parameters. For the Z  2  invariant we thus have <lb/>(−1) <lb/> ∆  = sign [t  1  − (t  2  + t  3  )] sign <lb/> t <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  − (t  2  − t  3  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> (3) <lb/>Interestingly, these quantities depend just on first near-<lb/>est neighbor hopping parameters and not on second near-<lb/>est neighbor hoppings describing spin-orbit interaction. <lb/>This is a direct consequence of symmetry: each site in <lb/>the unit cell is connected to 3 pairs of second nearest <lb/>neighbors sharing the same distance but placed in oppo-<lb/>site directions (sites 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 in Fig. 1). For this <lb/>reason the Hamiltonian matrix H(k) at any TRIM point <lb/>does not depend on Haldane-Kane-Mele second-neighbor <lb/>spin-orbit coupling. We have in fact <lb/> H(k) = <lb/> g(k) −f (k) <lb/> −f (k) <lb/>  *  −g(k) <lb/> where <lb/> g(k) = 2[t  KM  sin(k  y  ) <lb/> − t <lb/> KM  sin(k  x <lb/> √ <lb/> 3/2 + k  y  /2) <lb/> − t <lb/> KM  sin(−k  x <lb/> √ <lb/> 3/2 + k  y  /2)] <lb/>f (k) = t  1  exp(ık  x  / <lb/> √ <lb/> 3) <lb/>+ exp[−ık  x  /(2 <lb/> √ <lb/> 3)][t  2  exp(−ık  y  /2) + t  3  exp(ık  y  /2)]. <lb/> It is then easy to check that g(k) at any TRIM point is <lb/>identically zero. Still, the spin-orbit interaction is essen-<lb/>tial in order to obtain a non-trivial topological behavior: <lb/>for t  KM  = 0 a modulation in the hopping parameters <lb/>would only transform a semi-metal into a trivial insula-<lb/>tor while for t  KM  = 0 the system is always an insula-<lb/>tor (except just at the phase boundary—see below). For <lb/> t  KM  = 0, by tuning the hopping parameters t  i  we may <lb/>go from a trivial insulating phase to a topological Quan-<lb/>tum Spin Hall insulating regime. The values where a <lb/>phase transition occurs—either between QSHI and topo-<lb/>logically trivial insulator (TTI) for t  KM  = 0 or between <lb/>semimetal and TTI for t  KM  = 0—are identical and the <lb/>phase diagram that we obtain (Fig. 2 (a)) coincides, as <lb/>far as the phase separations are concerned, with the one <lb/>reported in refs. 15 and 16 for t  KM  = 0. We observe that <lb/>right at the transition between QSHI and TTI phases the <lb/>single particle gap ∆  sp  closes down and the system recov-<lb/>ers a semi-metallic behavior. We analyze in particular the <lb/>behavior of the system varying just one hopping parame-<lb/>ter (t  2  ) with t  KM  = t <lb/> KM  = t <lb/> KM  , moving in the parame-<lb/>ter space along the line shown in Fig. 2 (a) where t  3  = t  1  . <lb/>For this choice of parameters the gap between filled and <lb/></body>

			<body> empty states evolves as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Before the <lb/>transition, the absolute value of the energy gap depends <lb/>on t  KM  but after the transition it becomes independent <lb/>on t  KM  and increases linearly as E  g  = 2 (t  2  − 2t  1  ). <lb/>In the lower panel of Fig. 2 we show the evolution of <lb/>the band structure assuming t  KM  = t <lb/> KM  = t <lb/> KM  and <lb/> t  KM  /t  1  = 0.1 along the line in parameter space where <lb/> t  1  = t  3  . By increasing the value of t  2  the positions in <lb/>k-space of the band gap move along a line parallel to <lb/> k  y  = <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 3 <lb/> k  x  and merge at M points where the gap closes <lb/>down for t  2  /t  1  = 2, signaling the topological transition <lb/>from QSHI to TTI. We stress again that the spin-orbit <lb/>term, even including a modulation in second-neighbor <lb/>hopping interaction, does not alter the parity symmetry <lb/>(C  2  ) and as such it does not affect the gap position in <lb/>k-space. After the transition the gap remains at M. <lb/>We turn now to the Kekulé distortion. In this case <lb/>the unit cell contains six atoms, with alternating values <lb/>in the nearest-neighbor hopping parameters t and t <lb/>  as <lb/>shown in Fig. 1 (b). In principle we have two possible <lb/>values of the second nearest-neighbor parameters; since <lb/>their dependence on the lattice deformation is not easy <lb/>to assess we have considered two separate cases, namely <lb/> t <lb/> KM  = t  KM  and t <lb/> KM  = t <lb/>  /t × t  KM  as suggested in <lb/>Ref. 17. <lb/>Neglecting at first the variation in the second nearest-<lb/>neighbor hopping parameters we notice that the mini-<lb/>mum separation between filled and empty states is, for <lb/>any value of t <lb/>  /t and t  KM  /t, pinned at a Γ point. This <lb/>is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3 where the disper-<lb/>sion of the highest occupied band is shown for different <lb/>values of t <lb/>  /t and for t  KM  /t = 0.1. This remains true <lb/>also for t <lb/> KM  = t  KM  . We may then identify the analytic <lb/>dependence of the Z  2  invariant on the hopping parame-<lb/>ters by considering the eigenvalues at the Γ point only, <lb/>where the diagonalization of the 6 × 6 Hamiltonian ma-<lb/>trix is trivial, and look for the conditions that guaran-<lb/>tee a zero gap between filled and empty states. Indeed <lb/>in the non-interacting case the transition from a triv-<lb/>ial to a non-trivial topological phase requires the gap to <lb/>close down. The six eigenvalues at Γ (e  1  = −t − 2t <lb/>  , <lb/> e  2  = t + 2t <lb/>  , e  3  = t − t <lb/>  − <lb/>√ <lb/> 3(t  KM  + 2t <lb/> KM  ), e  4  = <lb/> −t+t <lb/>  − <lb/>√ <lb/> 3(t  KM  +2t <lb/> KM  ), e  5  = t−t <lb/>  + <lb/> √ <lb/> 3(t  KM  +2t <lb/> KM  ), <lb/> e  6  = −t + t <lb/>  + <lb/> √ <lb/> 3(t  KM  + 2t <lb/> KM  )) are easily obtained from <lb/>the hamiltonian matrix <lb/> H  ↑  (Γ) = <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 −t <lb/>  m −t m <lb/>  *  −t <lb/> −t <lb/> 0 −t <lb/>  m −t m <lb/>  * <lb/> m <lb/>  *  −t <lb/> 0 −t <lb/>  m −t <lb/>−t m <lb/>  *  −t <lb/> 0 −t <lb/>  m <lb/>m −t m <lb/>  *  −t <lb/> 0 −t <lb/> −t <lb/>  m −t m <lb/>  *  −t <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (4) <lb/>where m = ı(2t <lb/> KM  + t  KM  ). Therefore the gap closure <lb/>occurs when one of the following two conditions is verified <lb/> t − t <lb/>  − <lb/>√ <lb/> 3(t  KM  + 2t <lb/> KM  ) = 0 <lb/> t − t <lb/>  + <lb/> √ <lb/> 3(t  KM  + 2t <lb/> KM  ) = 0 <lb/>(5) <lb/>This leads to the following analytic expression for the Z  2 <lb/> invariant as a function of the hopping parameters: <lb/>(−1) <lb/> ∆  = sign <lb/> (t − t <lb/>  ) <lb/> 2  − 3 (t  KM  + 2t <lb/> KM  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (6) <lb/>This relation has been checked numerically in terms of <lb/>parity eigenvalues according to eq. (2). We obtain in this <lb/>way the phase diagram of Fig. 3 (a): any t  KM  = 0 defines <lb/>a range of t <lb/>  /t where the system behaves as a QSHI, <lb/>and this range depends on the strength of the spin-orbit <lb/>coupling. The hopping modulation has different effects <lb/>if t  KM  = 0 or t  KM  = 0 as shown in Fig. 3 (b) where the <lb/>evolution of the gap value is reported for t  KM  = t <lb/> KM  : for <lb/>the undistorted system in particular we have zero gap and <lb/>maximum gap for t  KM  = 0 and t  KM  = 0, respectively. <lb/>Notice that the analytic expression of the Z  2  invariant <lb/>allows us to obtain quite simply the phase diagram also <lb/>in the case of t <lb/> KM  = t  KM  and that for t <lb/> KM  = t <lb/>  /t×t  KM <lb/> we recover the results <lb/> 18  of Ref. 17. <lb/> III.

(1), is a paradigmatic ex-<lb/>ample of an interacting topological insulator <lb/> 19,20  . In this <lb/>case, in order to topologically characterize the system, we <lb/>face two distinct problems: on one side we need to sub-<lb/>stitute the single particle band structure with the quasi-<lb/>particle excitation energies that can be obtained from the <lb/>many-body Green&apos;s function; on the other side we must <lb/>extend the Z  2  parity invariant, originally associated to a <lb/>single particle state, to the interacting case. In Refs. 21 <lb/>and 22 it has been demonstrated that the Z  2  invariant <lb/>is determined by the behavior of the one-particle propa-<lb/>gator at zero frequency only: the inverse of the Green&apos;s <lb/>function at zero frequency defines a fictitious noninter-<lb/>acting topological hamiltonian <lb/> 23 <lb/> h  topo  (k) ≡ −G <lb/> −1  (k, 0) <lb/>(8) <lb/>and its eigenvectors <lb/> h  topo  (k)|k, n =  n  (k)|k, n <lb/> (9) <lb/>are the quantities that in eq. (2) replace the non-<lb/>interacting band eigenvectors to obtain the topological <lb/>invariant for the interacting system. <lb/>These concepts have been recently applied to iden-<lb/>tify the topological character of heavy fermion mixed va-<lb/>lence compounds <lb/> 24–27  and of the half-filled honeycomb <lb/>lattice <lb/> 28  also in the presence of uniaxial bond dimeriza-<lb/>tion <lb/> 7  . <lb/>In order to solve the eigenvalue problem (9), in strict <lb/>analogy with what is done in any standard Tight-Binding <lb/></body>

			<body> accuracy of the results by using larger and larger clus-<lb/>ter sizes. This procedure is limited by the dimensions of <lb/>Hilbert space used in the exact diagonalization, dimen-<lb/>sions that grow exponentially with the number of sites. <lb/>A further limitation in the cluster choice arises by a sym-<lb/>metry requirement since only clusters that preserve the <lb/>point group symmetries of the lattice must be used. <lb/> 28,30 <lb/> The role of symmetry in Quantum Cluster approaches is <lb/>complex: the extended system is described as a periodic <lb/>repetition of correlated units and the translation period-<lb/>icity is preserved only at the superlattice level. In the <lb/>honeycomb lattice where the Dirac cones are the con-<lb/>sequence of perfect long-range order, theories based on <lb/>Quantum Cluster schemes, such as CDMFT, VCA, and <lb/>CPT, regardless of them being variational or not, and <lb/>independent on the details of the specific implementa-<lb/>tions (different impurity solvers, different temperatures), <lb/>at t  KM  = 0 give rise to a spurious excitation gap for <lb/> U → 0. The only exception is the Dynamical Cluster <lb/>Approach (DCA) that preserves by construction transla-<lb/>tion symmetry and has been shown to describe better the <lb/>small U regime; DCA becomes, however, less accurate at <lb/>large U where it overemphasizes the semimetallic behav-<lb/>ior of the honeycomb lattice. <lb/> 36  In this sense DCA and the <lb/>other Quantum Cluster approaches can be considered as <lb/>complementary and it would be interesting to compare <lb/>their results also for the distorted honeycomb lattice. An-<lb/>other strategy has been proposed that seems to overcome <lb/>this shortcoming, providing for the undistorted honey-<lb/>comb lattice a semimetal behavior up to some finite U . <lb/> 37 <lb/> The strategy consists in choosing clusters that break the <lb/>lattice point C  6  symmetry (8-and 10-site clusters). The <lb/>quasiparticle band dispersion that is obtained in this way <lb/>is, however, unphysical: quasiparticle energies at k and <lb/> Rk, R being a point group rotation, turn out to be differ-<lb/>ent, violating a very basic rule of band structure. <lb/> 28  And <lb/>it is just this violation that makes the system semimetal-<lb/>lic at finite U since the gap closes at a k-point but not <lb/>at its rotated counterpart. For this reason breaking the <lb/>rotational symmetry is not an allowed strategy to correct <lb/>the erroneous insulating phase. <lb/>We have checked the dependence of our results on the <lb/>cluster size by comparing the case of the generalized <lb/>dimerization results obtained for 2-and 8-site clusters; <lb/>we have verified that no significant changes occur in the <lb/>spectral functions and for this reason we report results <lb/>obtained only for the smallest cluster size, namely, 2-and <lb/>6-site clusters for the generalized bond dimerization and <lb/>Kekulé distortion, respectively. Notice that in this case <lb/>the clusters used to &quot; tile &quot; the infinite lattice are those <lb/>shown in Fig. 1 and that t  1  (t <lb/>  ) describe intra-cluster <lb/>hoppings for the two distortions (generalized dimeriza-<lb/>tion and Kekulé, respectively). Eq. (11) is solved by an <lb/> M × M matrix inversion at each k and ω. A second <lb/> M × M matrix inversion is needed to obtain the topo-<lb/>logical hamiltonian according to eq. (8). The topological <lb/>hamiltonian is then diagonalized and its eigenvectors are <lb/>used for the calculation of Z  2  according to (2). <lb/>It is worth recalling that the eigenvalues of h  topo  used <lb/>to calculate the value of the Z  2  invariant in principle <lb/>have nothing to do with the quasi-particle excitation en-<lb/>ergies: they only contain topological information and the <lb/>full Green&apos;s function is needed to calculate quasi-particle <lb/>spectral functions <lb/> A(k, ω) = <lb/>1 <lb/> π <lb/> n <lb/> Im G(k, n, ω) <lb/> (12) <lb/>where <lb/> G(k, n, ω) = <lb/>1 <lb/> M <lb/> ii  <lb/> e <lb/> −ik·(ri−r  i  )  α <lb/> n * <lb/>i  (k)α <lb/> n <lb/>i   (k)G  ii   (k, ω) <lb/> with n the band index and α <lb/> n <lb/>i  (k) the eigenstate coeffi-<lb/>cients obtained by the single-particle band calculation. <lb/> 35 <lb/> Spectral functions can also be used to identify topological <lb/>properties, looking for the existence of gapless quasipar-<lb/>ticle states in one-dimensional (1D) honeycomb ribbons. <lb/>The energy broadening necessarily involved in the cal-<lb/>culation of spectral functions makes this procedure less <lb/>accurate than the calculation of the Z  2  invariant based <lb/>on h  topo  eigenvectors: in G <lb/> −1  no energy broadening is <lb/>required and the boundaries in the phase diagram are <lb/>sharply identified. <lb/>Fig. 4 shows the results that we obtain for inter-<lb/>acting electrons in the honeycomb lattice with the two <lb/>kinds of hopping modulation (generalized dimerization <lb/>and Kekulé distortion). By comparing the interacting <lb/>case and the non-interacting one we notice that the <lb/>QSHI/TTI phases are modified by the local e-e interac-<lb/>tion for both lattice distortions. In the case of generalized <lb/>dimerization (Fig. 4 (a)) the overall region in parameter <lb/>space where the system is in the QSHI phase increases <lb/>with U but at the cost of larger distortions: when on the <lb/>contrary the system is almost undistorted (lower corner <lb/>on the left of Fig. 4 (a), where t  2  and t  3  are closer to <lb/> t  1  ) the effect of e-e is to extend the region of the TTI <lb/>phase. For U ≥ 3.5 the undistorted system is always <lb/>topologically trivial. <lb/>The phase separation lines remain linear and indepen-<lb/>dent on the strength of spin-orbit coupling, as in the non <lb/>interacting case. Indeed, the effect of e-e interaction is <lb/>to induce a renormalization of the intra-cluster hopping <lb/>parameters and therefore the topological hamiltonian of <lb/>eq. (8) coincides with an effective single-particle hamil-<lb/>tonian with modified hopping terms. This is particularly <lb/>evident when a 2-site cluster is used as a basic unit in <lb/>CPT, but remains true with larger clusters. We have <lb/>checked this by considering an 8-site cluster and we do <lb/>not find significant differences. <lb/>In the Kekulé distortion, as expected from the previous <lb/>analysis for the non-interacting case, different results are <lb/>obtained assuming t <lb/> KM  = t  KM  or t <lb/> KM  = t  KM  . How-<lb/>ever in both cases the effect of e-e interaction favors even <lb/>more clearly the TTI phase since the total area where <lb/>the system behaves as a QSHI is reduced with respect <lb/>to the non-interacting case and, for a given distortion, <lb/></body>

CONCLUSIONS <lb/> We have studied the joint effects of intrinsic spin-orbit <lb/>coupling, hopping modulation and on-site e-e interaction <lb/>on the topological properties of the 2D honeycomb lat-<lb/>tice. The goal was to understand how the topological <lb/>phases induced by intrinsic spin-orbit coupling are mod-<lb/>ified by different kinds of lattice distortions and by e-e <lb/> interaction. The main results may be summarized as fol-<lb/></body>

			<body> lows. In the non-interacting case the shape of the phase <lb/>diagram obtained assuming a generalized dimerization <lb/>does not depend on the value of the intrinsic spin-orbit <lb/>coupling: the phase separation lines are identical for any <lb/>value of t  KM  , with the noteworthy difference that in the <lb/>parameter range where the system is for t  KM  = 0 a semi-<lb/>metal, for any other t  KM  = 0 the system is a QSHI. In <lb/>the absence of spin-orbit coupling the Kekulé distortion <lb/>makes the system insulating and in this case the param-<lb/>eter space where the system behaves as a QSHI increases <lb/>with the value of t  KM  . <lb/>We have extended the analysis in terms of topological <lb/>invariants to the case of interacting electrons by calcu-<lb/>lating the dressed Green&apos;s function within CPT and the <lb/>topological hamiltonian. For both lattice distortions, in <lb/>the regime of relatively small deformations, the effect of <lb/> e-e interaction is to reduce the region where the system <lb/>behaves as a QSHI. In this sense we may conclude that <lb/>lattice distortions and e-e interaction do not cooperate <lb/>in inducing a non trivial topological phase but rather re-<lb/>duce the possibility of finding the honeycomb lattice in a <lb/>non-trivial topological state. <lb/></body>
