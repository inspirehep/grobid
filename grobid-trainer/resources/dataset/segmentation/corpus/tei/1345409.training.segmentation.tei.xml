			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> Photon-induced reactions have been used to study atomic nuclei since more than seven decades. A first theoretical <lb/>analysis of resonance effects by Bethe and Placzek [1] already indicated two important reactions types, photodisinte-<lb/>gration of nuclei and photon scattering. Bethe and Placzek stated that cross section σ for a particular reaction channel <lb/> f depends on the photon energy -as expressed by the reduced wavelength λ/2π -statistical terms that depend on the <lb/>spin of the excited state J and of the ground state J  0 , a Breit-Wigner resonance shape around the resonance energy E  x <lb/> and resonance widths. In a notation slightly more convenient than the one used by Bethe and Placzek, one needs the <lb/>partial decay width Γ  0 for a radiative transition into the ground state, the total width Γ (including radiative width and <lb/>possible particle widths) and the partial width for decay into the observed channel f . The relation <lb/> σ  f  (E) = <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/> λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4π 2 <lb/> 2J + 1 <lb/>2J 0  + 1 <lb/> Γ  0  Γ  f <lb/> (E − E  x ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> + Γ  2  /4 <lb/> (1) <lb/>demonstrates that only those resonances are excited by photons that have a significant partial branch into the ground <lb/>state. In many nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF, resonant photon scattering, see, e.g., [2]) experiments one <lb/>therefore even assumes that all other decay branches are weak and that Γ  0  ≈ Γ as the only observed decay of the <lb/>excited level is the decay back to the ground state ( f = 0). <lb/></body>

			<body> In the same year as Ref. [1], Bothe and Gentner carried out experiments with photons produced in a proton-capture <lb/>reaction [3]. The gamma ray with energies of about 17 MeV was used to irradiate various materials. Following pho-<lb/>todisintegration reactions in the targets, radiochemical analyses allowed them to deduce the lifetimes of the unstable <lb/>nuclides. For the case of copper, where the photodisintegration rate was highest, they were capable of estimating <lb/>a cross section of about 50 mb for the process. Today we know that the resonance maximum of the giant dipole <lb/>resonance in copper is close to 17 MeV and has a peak cross section of about 67 mb (cf., e.g., Ref. [4]). <lb/>The characteristic resonance shape of the giant dipole resonance, however, was first identified in 1947 by Baldwin <lb/>and Klaiber [5]. They identified the resonance shape in a photo-fission experiment from actinide nuclei following <lb/>a subtraction and unfolding procedure which they applied to the yield curve they had obtained from a series of <lb/>measurements with bremsstrahlung. <lb/>The electric giant dipole resonance is prototypical for an entire class of excitation modes in nuclei. Within a <lb/>macroscopic, geometrical description, we assume that giant resonances are excitation modes of the nucleus where <lb/>many nucleons contribute to shape oscillations. Microscopically giant resonances are formed by the coherent super-<lb/>position of one-particle-one-hole configurations across at least one major shell. Prominent examples are the isoscalar <lb/>giant quadrupole resonance (cf. [6, 7]) and the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (breathing mode, see [8, 9]). One <lb/>has to distinguish isoscalar excitations, where protons and neutrons move in phase, and isovector excitations (such as <lb/>the isovector giant dipole resonance) with the the protons and neutrons oscillating out of phase. <lb/>In open-shell nuclei, valence nucleons produce excitation modes that may be visualized as surface vibrations. <lb/>A textbook example is given by the low-lying quadrupole excitation [10] that constitutes a fundamental vibrational <lb/>mode. With collective and single-particle degrees of freedom, a plethora of excitations are generated through coupling. <lb/>The interaction mechanism in photo-induced reactions are well understood. This allows one to extract nuclear <lb/>structure information from the experimental observable, e.g., a cross section. Beyond processes with real photons, the <lb/>electromagnetic interaction dominates also electron scattering and -at low energies or large impact parameters -ion <lb/>scattering. Electron scattering data [11] as well as Coulomb excitation [12] are therefore well suited to complement <lb/>the information available with real photons. Real photons probe excitations of low multipolarity, hence I will discuss <lb/>– after some brief remarks on recent technical and methodological improvements – few selected current examples of <lb/>results on electric dipole (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), and electric quadrupole (E2) excitations. <lb/> 2. Experimental matters <lb/> 2.1. Photon sources <lb/> There are various sources of photons. Besides gamma rays from capture reactions, numerous other techniques <lb/>have been employed. In the early years of photonuclear reactions, radioactive sources -in particular on centrifuges -<lb/>were used [13, 14]. When working with sources, intensity is clearly an issue. In addition, the energy range of sources <lb/>is limited, and the gamma-ray spectrum is so narrow that there are rather few other nuclei that feature a level whose <lb/>energy coincides with the transition energy of the source. Broadening the spectrum through Compton scattering <lb/>usually creates difficult spectral distributions and enhances the problems concerning intensity. <lb/>Bremsstrahlung provides a continuous spectrum that allows one to excite all suitable levels in the target nucleus <lb/>in one experiment. This gives rise to experimental challenges, e.g., how to disentangle transitions into the ground <lb/>state and those to lower-lying excited states and possible feeding of lower-lying levels. While earlier bremsstrahlung <lb/>sources suffered from low count rates due to the pulsed operation of the driver linacs, high repetition rates are available <lb/>from either electrostatic accelerators (e.g., [15]) or superconducting linacs (e.g., the setup at the Darmstadt supercon-<lb/>ducting electron accelerator S–DALINAC [16] or the one at the Dresden-Rossendorf ELBE facility [17]). Off-axis <lb/>bremsstrahlung has been used for producing partial linear polarization of the bremsstrahlung [18]. <lb/>Tagged bremsstrahlung overcomes part of these problems by measuring the energy of the slowed-down electron <lb/>in coincidence with the reaction channel so that the excitation energy is measured independently from the decay <lb/>branch. Due to the limited count rates of the electron detectors, however, the maximum photon flux is reduced by <lb/>several orders of magnitude as compared to the untagged bremsstrahlung. An example for a dedicated tagger setup <lb/>for nuclear spectroscopy aiming at high resolution and high count rates is given by the photon tagger NEPTUN that <lb/>was recently installed at the S-DALINAC [19]. <lb/>Most of the data on photo-neutron production cross sections have been measured using positron annihilation in <lb/>flight [20]. By subtracting the cross section obtained from bremsstrahlung produced by electrons from those produced <lb/></body>

			<body> by positrons, an effective excitation region is selected that is rather monochromatic. As these experiments were usually <lb/>carried out at pulsed linear accelerators, data taking rates were limited by the duty cycle of the accelerators. <lb/>In recent years, laser Compton-backscattering facilities providing high gamma-ray intensities have come into <lb/>operation. The flagship laboratory concerned with nuclear structure and astrophysics in this context is the Duke <lb/>University free-electron laser laboratory with its high-intensity gamma-ray source HIγS [21]. Here, particularly high <lb/>intensities are reached through intra-cavity backscattering of a free-electron laser. Laser Compton-backscattering <lb/>provides gamma beams with a narrow spectrum and high degrees of polarization close to 100%. <lb/> 2.2. Detectors <lb/> Furthermore, significant increase in efficiency was obtained during the past decades through new detector types <lb/>and/or advances in detector fabrication. Germanium crystals have more than tripled in size since the mid-1980s <lb/>thereby allowing gamma-rays to be efficiently detected with excellent resolution. By introducing segmentation of the <lb/>detector, it is possible to either determine the polarization of the incident gamma-rays by using the detector as an <lb/>active scatterer [22] or extract the first interaction point (e.g., see Ref. [23, 24]). The latter is important for Coulomb <lb/>excitation experiments on radioactive nuclei in inverse kinematics. <lb/>Radioactive ion beams from post-accelerated ISOL beams or in-flight facilities have become available in the past <lb/>twenty years only. In addition to Coulomb-excitation experiments in inverse kinematics [25], plans exist to use stored <lb/>rare ions also for electron-scattering experiments [26, 27]. <lb/>Further improvements are imminent as the current progress in electronics allows entire pulse shapes to be digitized. <lb/>This is utilized for a fast pre-analysis from which, e.g., pile-up effects can be deconvoluted [28], and the data can be <lb/>transferred with high throughput. <lb/> 3. Electric dipole excitations <lb/> 3.1. Pygmy electric dipole resonance <lb/> For the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) the gross features -centroid energies, widths, and strengths -<lb/>have been established throughout the valley of stability [20]. The IVGDR exhausts about 100% of the energy-weighted <lb/>Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule. In addition, neutron-capture reactions identified E1 strength also below the <lb/>IVGDR [29]. As the effect is much weaker than the IVGDR, the structure has been dubbed Pygmy Resonance (PR). Its <lb/>structural origin was first proposed to arise from the oscillation of excess neutrons against a proton-neutron saturated <lb/>core within a three-fluid model by Mohan, Danos, and Biedenharn [30]. Similarly, Iachello [31] suggested modes <lb/>of isospin-zero clusters (e.g., alpha particles) inside the nucleus as possible origin for additional E1 strength at low <lb/>energies. If these assumptions held true, the PR would be structurally different from the IVGDR, and it would strongly <lb/>emerge in nuclei with an exotic neutron-to-proton ratio. <lb/>I have summarized the status of the field in a conference report [32] several years ago to which I refer the reader <lb/>for details. Here basic results are summarized only, and recent results are added. (Note the list of references is far <lb/>from complete.) <lb/> • NRF experiments on semi-magic or doubly magic nuclei show a resonance-like structure with many individual <lb/>states between about 5 MeV excitation energy and the particle separation threshold. This PR strength con-<lb/>tributes usually 1% or less to the TRK sum rule. <lb/> • At even lower energies one finds single E1 excitations that are thought to arise from the coupling of the lowest <lb/>quadrupole surface vibration mode with the octupole surface vibration [33]. As the structure of these states is <lb/>very peculiar, they are left out of the considerations for the PR. <lb/> • Mass regions where the PR was studied include the Z = 20 shell closure [34–36], the N = 50 shell closure <lb/>[37–40], the tin isotopes (Z = 50, [41, 42]), the N = 82 isotones [43–46], and the Pb region (Z = 82, [47–51]). <lb/> • In nearly all cases, the vast majority of the dipole excitations has electric multipole character [52]. <lb/> • Different microscopic nuclear structure models are capable of explaining -at least on a qualitative level -gross <lb/>features and fragmentation of the PR. The calculations suggest that these E1 excitations can indeed be explained <lb/>by an out-of-phase oscillation of excess neutrons against a proton-neutron core [49, 50]. <lb/></body>

			<body> • A statistical analysis of the fine structure (for the example of the N = 82 isotones) shows level repulsion at short <lb/>distances that are a signature of large mixing matrix elements [53]. <lb/> • Coulomb excitation or Coulomb dissociation experiments on radioactive isotopes provide insight into nuclides <lb/>with particularly large N/Z ratios. One finds evidence for particularly strong E1 excitations at low energies. <lb/>Examples include <lb/> 6 He [54], oxygen isotopes [55, 56], <lb/> 68 Ni [57], and the <lb/> 132 Sn region [58]. The Coulomb disso-<lb/>ciation experiments probe the nucleus above the neutron separation threshold and therefore yield higher average <lb/>excitation energies and higher TRK sum-rule depletions for the PR in comparison to Coulomb excitation and <lb/>NRF. <lb/> • There is an ongoing discussion about the comparison of the PR if excited by photons from the ground state with <lb/>the gamma-ray strength function from light-ion scattering ( &quot; Oslo method &quot; , see, e.g. [59–61] and Refs. therein). <lb/> • In recent years, the group at the Helmholtz research centre Dresden-Rossendorf has proposed an analysis to <lb/>correct NRF spectra at high excitation energies for unresolved states [62, 63]. It is based on a simulation of <lb/>the background shape, correction of the detector response, and a statistical model to correct for both feeding <lb/>of lower-lying states and unobserved decay branches. The correction factors obtained within this method are <lb/>substantial and indicate that the PR region is smoothly linked to the IVGDR region. At the same time, the <lb/>Dresden-Rossendorf group suggested a new parameterization of the IVGDR [64] to include possible triaxial <lb/>shapes of the nucleus. Following this ansatz, they find that most of the E1 strength below the neutron separation <lb/>energy is likely due to the tail of the IVGDR, however, a small fraction of the E1 strength in the PR usually is <lb/>unaccounted for by the extrapolation. <lb/> • Other recent studies have investigated the PR by inelastic alpha scattering in coincidence with gamma-ray <lb/>detection. Due to the isoscalar nature of the alpha particle, the experiments probe isoscalar excitations in <lb/>contrast to the photons from which both isoscalar and isovector modes can be excited. In these experiments one <lb/>finds that at lower energies significant isoscalar E1 strength is found, whereas there is no or very little signal <lb/>above approx. 6.7 MeV [65]. Microscopic models suggest the trend that the low-lying fraction of the PR region <lb/>is mainly due to an &quot; isoscalar &quot; motion (e.g., excess neutrons vs. N ≈ Z core), whereas the higher-lying part <lb/>reflects the transition to the tail of the IVGDR [66]. <lb/> • Intermediate-energy forward-angle proton scattering was suggested as a tool to extract the full E1 strength [67]. <lb/> 3.2. Photodisintegration: an astrophysical example <lb/> Knowing the details of the E1 strength distribution around the particle separation energy is an important input for <lb/>nuclear astrophysics. In a seminal analysis, Goriely has studied for the example of the r process of nucleosynthesis <lb/>how strongly predicted abundance patterns may vary if one introduces PR strength close to the particle threshold [68]. <lb/>This holds basically for all nucleosynthesis processes that take place in particularly hot environments as photodisin-<lb/>tegration is directly competing with capture reactions. <lb/>Bremsstrahlung experiments at the S-DALINAC have been used to study reaction rates in a p-(or γ-) process <lb/>environment. Due to the exponential decrease of the Planck spectrum with energy, only an energy interval of about 1 <lb/>MeV above the particle separation energy is of relevance for the astrophysical rate. This can be sampled by a series of <lb/>measurements with different endpoint energies. An appropriate weighting of the bremsstrahlung spectra allows one <lb/>to extract the astrophysical rate more or less directly from the measured data [69, 70]. <lb/>However, one caveat is in order: The experiments of Refs. [69, 70] determine the disintegration rates for nuclei in <lb/>their ground states only. In hot environments above 1 GK in temperature, nuclear levels other than the ground state are <lb/>populated, according to the Boltzmann distribution. Hence photo-activation serves first and foremost to benchmark <lb/>statistical model calculations used as input for astrophysical network calculations [71]. <lb/> 4. Magnetic dipole excitations <lb/> M1 modes in nuclei arise due to orbital motion or spin-flip transitions. A recent review by Heyde, von Neumann-<lb/>Cosel, and Richter [72] has collected all important details on this issue with particular emphasis on the low-lying <lb/>collective orbital M1 scissors mode that occurs most prominently in heavy deformed nuclei. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.1. Orbital M1 strength: the scissors mode <lb/> The scissors mode was first discovered in electron scattering in the heavy deformed nucleus <lb/> 156 Gd [73], following <lb/>predictions within a semi-classical two-rotor model [74] and the interacting-boson approximation [75]. From the form <lb/>factor [73], an orbital motion was suggested, and proton-scattering experiments revealed little influence of the spin <lb/>on the total strength [76]. Subsequent systematic NRF experiments [77] in many nuclei throughout the N = 82 − 126 <lb/>major shell produced an impressive data set [78] whose results may be summarized as follows: <lb/> • The scissors mode occurs in this mass region in an energy window of approximately 2.5 -4 MeV. The average <lb/>excitation energy of about 3 MeV is independent from the deformation and varies slowly with mass. <lb/> • The summed M1 strength strongly depends on the deformation parameter δ. Like the rotational first 2 <lb/> +  state in <lb/>deformed nuclei, its strength is proportional to δ <lb/> 2 , cf. Ref. [79], and it saturates at mid-shell at about 3 μ <lb/> 2 <lb/> N  . <lb/> • A phenomenological sum-rule analysis leads to a good description of the experimental data with no free param-<lb/>eters, but using experimental data on, e.g., g factors and deformation parameters as an input [80, 81]. <lb/> • Outside the above mentioned mass region deviations are observed. However, in these cases the identification of <lb/>scissors-mode fragments is not as unambiguous as in the case of the N = 82 -126 major shell [81]. <lb/> • An analysis of the level-spacing distribution supports the assumption that the mode&apos;s underlying structure is <lb/>collective and that the level density in the even-even nuclei is not too high [82]. <lb/> • In odd-mass nuclei, fragmentation is much higher due to the very high level density. Part of the total strength <lb/>therefore remains unresolved in the experimental background of an NRF spectrum. The full strength informa-<lb/>tion may be restored using a statistical fluctuation analysis of the spectra [83–85]. <lb/> 4.2. An example for spin-M1 strength: photo-disintegration of the deuteron <lb/> The deuterons structure features important information on the nucleon-nucleon force. We know very well about <lb/>the ground state of the deuteron, which is an isospin-singlet, spin-triplet state. The spin-singlet isospin-triplet states <lb/>include the ground-state configurations of the di-neutron and the di-neutron that are unbound. Hence -due to the <lb/>charge-independence of the nuclear force -also the isospin-triplet member in the deuteron is unbound, and it is <lb/>excited from the deuterons ground state by a spin-flip M1 transition. The inverse reaction is the neutron capture on <lb/>a proton, which was the very first nuclear reaction to take place in the universe after the big bang. The formation <lb/>of the deuteron represented the first step in the so-called big-bang (or primordial) nucleosynthesis (BBN, [86, 87]) <lb/>producing the lightest nuclides, i. e. d, <lb/> 3 He, <lb/> 4 He, and <lb/> 7 Li. About one second through five minutes after the big bang, <lb/>the universe was cool enough so that the capture reaction rate could outweigh photo-dissociation. Yet it was dense <lb/>enough so that a sufficient reaction rate could be achieved. <lb/>Astronomical observations are capable of extracting the abundances of the nuclides produced in the BBN from the <lb/>spectra of old stars. On the other hand, the abundances are calculated using the so-called cosmological standard model <lb/>(CSM). In the latter, the abundances depend on a parameter, the baryon-to-photon ratio which is related to the density <lb/>of the universe. Hence by means of the CSM, the measured BBN abundances yield values for the baryon-to-photon <lb/>ratio. However, the results are inconsistent. While the <lb/> 4 He mass fraction and the <lb/> 7 Li abundance agree with each other, <lb/>the D abundance is significantly different, although it appears to agree with the observations of the WMAP satellite <lb/>on the cosmic microwave background [88]. <lb/>Among the largest uncertainties to the nuclear-physics input for the CSM predictions is the capture rate in the p + <lb/> n → d + γ reaction [89]. As again the direct modelling of the conditions in the early universe is difficult, it is more <lb/>instructive to benchmark the theoretical models that are used for the calculations. To this end, one must carefully <lb/>disentangle the M1 spin strength close to the threshold from E1 contributions at higher energies. Hence, experiments <lb/>were carried out at the HIγS facility at Duke University with monochromatic polarized photons [90] and at the S-<lb/>DALINAC using electron scattering [91] at 180 <lb/> •  . At 180 <lb/> •  , the longitudinal contributions in the electron scattering <lb/>cross section are suppressed, and M1 dominates the cross section for low momentum transfers. The results show that <lb/>the potential models currently employed for BBN abundance predictions within the CSM describe the data very well. <lb/>Hence, the observed inconsistencies must originate from other sources than this nuclear-physics input. <lb/></body>

			<body> 5. Electric quadrupole excitations <lb/> 5.1. Mixed-symmetry states <lb/> In addition to a quadrupole surface vibration originating from an in-phase motion of the protons and the neutrons, <lb/>an out-of-phase surface vibration is also possible. These modes represent the low-energy counterparts of the isoscalar <lb/>giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR) and the isovector giant quadrupole resonance (IVGQR). The low-energy elec-<lb/>tric quadrupole (E2) excitation with proton-neutron mixed symmetry has been proposed within the interacting boson <lb/>approximation [92], and first experimental evidence [93] was reported by Hamilton, Irbäck, and Elliott in 1984. <lb/>Research on mixed-symmetry states intensified when it became possible to reproduce these structures also in micro-<lb/>scopic models such as the Quasiparticle Phonon Nuclear Model [94] and when first investigations started searching <lb/>for multi-phonon configurations involving the mixed-symmetry quadrupole mode [95]. As the mixed-symmetry 2 <lb/> + <lb/> state in vibrational or gamma-soft nuclei is characterized by a strong M1 transition to the fully symmetric 2 <lb/> +  level and <lb/>a weakly collective E2 excitation, it still can be populated in NRF [96] and also from Coulomb excitation [97]. The 1 <lb/> + <lb/> member of the expected quintuplet of states arising from the coupling of the fully symmetric quadrupole phonon and <lb/>the mixed-symmetry phonon can also well be characterized from NRF; it is the analog of the scissors mode in a vibra-<lb/>tional nucleus. In order to gain more insight into the decay pattern, NRF is often combined with other spectroscopic <lb/>techniques [98]. <lb/>A fairly recent overview is given by Refs. [33, 99]. Among the achievements in the past years are the experimental <lb/>investigation of the mixed-symmetry state through electron and hadron scattering [100] as well as establishing a link <lb/>between the low-energy mixed-symmetry mode and the quadrupole giant resonances [101]. <lb/> 5.2. Low-lying E2 strength in magic nuclei: How strong is the giant quadrupole resonance? <lb/> Even-mass nuclei usually feature a strong E2 excitation at low energy [10]. It arises either from vibrational <lb/>or rotational motion in collective nuclei or from very distinct particle-hole excitations near shell closures. A large <lb/>amount of data exists [102] that shows the influence of shell structure, but at the shell closures one cannot conclude <lb/>on how &quot; magic &quot; a nucleus is, neither from the E2 strength nor from the depletion of the energy-weighted sum rule <lb/>(EWSR) for isoscalar E2 excitations <lb/> m  1 (E2) = <lb/> E  x,i  B(E2) i  = 30 <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/> A  2 <lb/> (c) <lb/> 2 <lb/> 8πm  p c  2  Ae <lb/> 2  R <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  = 71, 3 <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/> A  1/3  e <lb/> 2 fm <lb/> 4 MeV <lb/>(2) <lb/>with proton mass m p  , and nuclear radius parameter R  0 . At high energies, one expects the isoscalar giant quadrupole <lb/>resonance. Intuitively, one has the notion that a giant resonance should be strong and exhaust a large fraction of the <lb/>sum rule, if not of the total (non-energy-weighted) strength, just as in the case of the IVGDR. <lb/>An NRF experiment on <lb/> 40,48 Ca [34, 103] revealed also significant E2 strength below the particle separation energy, <lb/> i. e., about 8 MeV below the expected maximum of the ISGQR. In fact, 25 -40% of the EWSR are exhausted at these <lb/>low energies. This means that the share of the low-energy strength on the total non-energy-weighted E2 strength is <lb/>even larger. In the neighboring semi-magic <lb/> 52 Cr no significant E2 strength above the 2 <lb/> + <lb/> 1 was uncovered [104]. From <lb/>the systematics of the ISGQR one finds, in fact, a strong variation of the EWSR depletion factors, ranging from about <lb/>40% to 130%, see Ref. [105]. <lb/>The analysis of Ref. [104] took data for the 2 <lb/> + <lb/> 1 from literature [102] and compiled data from various NRF experi-<lb/>ments and electromagnetic excitations on magic nuclei. If one includes E2 strength beyond the excitation of the first <lb/>level from the ground state, one finds that in all doubly magic nuclei the exhaustion of the EWSR below the particle <lb/>threshold is particularly large. <lb/>From the measured depletion of the EWSR below the particle threshold and the assumption that the EWSR m  1 <lb/> is fully depleted if the E2 strength is summed from zero to infinity, one can extract the fraction of the non-energy-<lb/>weighted total E2 strength that is exhausted below the particle threshold if one takes for the probable energy of the <lb/>residual E2 strength the centroid of the ISGQR, E  x,ISGQR . To this end, we introduce a non-energy-weighted &quot; sum <lb/>rule &quot; (NEWSR) from the experimental data <lb/> m  0  = <lb/> B(E2) i  + <lb/> m  1  − <lb/> E  x,i  B(E2) i <lb/> E  x,ISGQR <lb/> . <lb/> (3) <lb/>The finding is [104] that in all (semi-)magic nuclei included in the analysis the NEWSR depletion at energies below <lb/>the particle threshold amounts to about 50% of the total strength, decreasing slightly towards heavier masses. <lb/></body>
