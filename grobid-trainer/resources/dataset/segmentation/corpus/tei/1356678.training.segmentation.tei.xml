			<body> 1. Neutrino detection in IceCube <lb/> IceCube can detect neutrinos of all flavors by observing the end products of charged-or neutral-current <lb/>deep-inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering in the glacial ice. The signatures of these interactions may be clas-<lb/>sified according to two broad categories: &quot; tracks, &quot; due to charged-current (CC) ν μ  scattering and &quot; cascades, &quot; <lb/>due to CC interactions of ν  e  as well as neutral-current (NC) interactions of all flavors <lb/> 1 . The distribution of <lb/>events with these signatures may be used to infer the angular, energy, and flavor distribution of an observed <lb/>neutrino flux. <lb/>Roughly 1/4 of neutrino interactions at a given energy will be neutral-current scatterings, where the <lb/>neutrino transfers ∼ 1/3 of its kinetic energy to a quark in the target nucleus [6], producing a short shower <lb/>of relativistic charged particles. If the neutrino vertex is sufficiently close to the instrumented volume, the <lb/>Cherenkov radiation they induce may be detected and used to reconstruct the vertex position and deposited <lb/></body>

Also, if a CC ν μ  interaction occurs inside the instrumented volume, it will appear more track-like <lb/>or more cascade-like depending on inelasticity of the interaction and the path of the outgoing muon. <lb/></note>

			<body> energy, and to some degree the direction. The remaining 3/4 of interactions are charged-current scatterings <lb/>that produce a charged lepton of the same flavor as the incident neutrino in addition to a hadronic shower. <lb/>While nearly all of the neutrino&apos;s energy is converted to relativistic charged particles, the accuracy with <lb/>which the direction and energy of the incident neutrino may be reconstructed depends strongly on the lepton <lb/>flavor. Electrons induce electromagnetic showers on the scale of a few meters whose energy can be recon-<lb/>structed to within 10% at 10 TeV if fully inside the instrumented volume [5]. The direction of the shower <lb/>may also be inferred by matching the pattern of detected photons to a template of the angular emission <lb/>profile of a shower, though the short scattering length of the glacial ice at the South Pole limits the angular <lb/>resolution to ∼ 10 <lb/> •  at 100 TeV [5]. Muons lose energy much less quickly, and so can traverse kilometers <lb/>of ice. While this makes it possible to positively identify ν  μ  CC interactions and reconstruct their direction <lb/>to within 1 <lb/> •  [3, 7], it is more difficult to infer the initial neutrino energy when only a segment of the muon <lb/>track can be observed. <lb/>The background comes from atmospheric muons that penetrate the 1.5 km of ice overburden; they <lb/>outnumber neutrinos 10000 to 1 in the stream of events transmitted from the South Pole. The traditional <lb/>method of separating neutrino events from the penetrating muon background is to select only events where <lb/>a muon comes from below the horizon, where the bulk of the earth completely attenuates the atmospheric <lb/>muons. While this makes the effective volume of the detector much larger than its geometrical volume, <lb/>the method is only sensitive to CC ν μ  interactions and cannot be extended much more than ∼ 5 <lb/> •  above <lb/>the horizon before penetrating muons begin to overwhelm neutrino-induced ones. An alternative approach <lb/>is to select events that start inside the instrumented volume: neutrinos are completely invisible, whereas <lb/>incoming muons induce Cherenkov photons that should be detected before the alleged interaction vertex. <lb/>Such a veto-based event selection can be sensitive to neutrinos of all flavors from all directions, though it <lb/>must sacrifice some effective volume to implement the veto. <lb/> 2. Atmospheric neutrinos <lb/> The largest contribution to the atmospheric neutrino flux (Figure 1) comes from the 2-body decays of <lb/>charged pions and kaons; because of the chiral structure of the weak interaction, these produce ν μ  almost <lb/>exclusively [8]. IceCube has observed this flux from the northern hemisphere with high statistics [3], and <lb/>its normalization, angular distribution, and spectral shape agree well with theoretical predictions [9]. The <lb/>flux of atmospheric ν  e  is much smaller, arising primarily from 3-body decays of K <lb/> 0 <lb/> L  [8]. This flux has also <lb/>been observed in IceCube up to a few TeV as an excess of cascade events over the predicted rate from NC <lb/>interactions of atmospheric ν μ  in the more densely-instrumented DeepCore subarray [4]. <lb/> 10  3 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  5 <lb/> 10  6 <lb/> 10  7 <lb/> Neutrino energy [GeV] <lb/>10  −7 <lb/> 10  −6 <lb/> 10  −5 <lb/> 10  −4 <lb/> 10  −3 <lb/> 10  −2 <lb/> 10  −1 <lb/> E  3 <lb/> Φν [GeV  2 <lb/> cm  −2 <lb/> sr  −1 <lb/> s  −1 <lb/> ] <lb/> C on ve n ti on al ν  μ <lb/> C o n v e n t i o n a l ν  e <lb/> P ro m pt ν  μ  /ν  e <lb/> 10  3 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  5 <lb/> 10  6 <lb/> 10  7 <lb/> Neutrino energy [GeV] <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>Flavor ratio Φν <lb/> μ  /Φν <lb/> e <lb/> Conventional only <lb/>with prompt <lb/> Fig. 1: Evolution of the composition of the atmospheric neutrino flux with energy.

The presence of equal-flavor components like those expected from charmed meson <lb/>decay in the atmosphere or from distant astrophysical sources weakens this trend. <lb/></body>

			<body> A third contribution to the neutrino flux observable in IceCube should come from the decays of heavy, <lb/>unstable mesons containing charm quarks like the D <lb/> ±  . These decay preferentially to 3-body final states, with <lb/>nearly equal branching ratios to ν  μ  and ν  e  [12]. In addition, their prompt decay (on the order of a picosecond) <lb/>makes re-interaction extremely unlikely, so the energy spectrum of neutrinos from charmed meson decay <lb/>follows that of the cosmic rays up to 50 PeV and is independent of the local density of the atmosphere at <lb/>production altitude [8]. The prompt flux has not yet been conclusively observed in either muons or neutrinos, <lb/>and predictions for the normalization of the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux vary widely [13, 11], though <lb/>more optimistic models like [14] have already been excluded by IceCube measurements [3]. <lb/>The presence of a prompt component has four observable effects on the atmospheric neutrino flux be-<lb/>tween ∼ 10 TeV and ∼ 50 PeV. First, because decay always dominates over re-interaction, the spectrum <lb/> dN/dE  ν  hardens from ∼ E <lb/> −3.7  to ∼ E <lb/> −2.7  . The local atmospheric density ceases to be important for the same <lb/>reason, and the flux becomes constant both in zenith angle and time of year. Lastly, the prompt contribution <lb/>to ν μ  and ν  e  is equal, so the flux becomes less and less ν μ  -dominated as the prompt component takes over <lb/>(Figure 1). <lb/> 3. Finding contained neutrino interactions <lb/> Active-veto methods have been used to isolate starting neutrinos with energies up to 10 TeV in the Deep-<lb/>Core subarray [4] and above 60 TeV in the full detector [2], but the region between 10 and 50 TeV, where <lb/>neutrinos from atmospheric charm decay should be observable, has not been fully explored. Extending veto <lb/>methods to this intermediate energy range without sacrificing sensitivity to all neutrino flavors or to neutri-<lb/>nos from the southern sky requires new techniques. The selection described here proceeds in three stages: <lb/>a pre-selection cut to reduce the data rate to a manageable level, veto cuts to remove events with obvious <lb/>signs of incoming muons, and a fiducial volume cut to remove events where incoming muons cannot be <lb/>vetoed with sufficiently high probability. The selection is expected to yield a few hundred neutrino events <lb/>depositing 1 TeV or more in the detector in 2 years of experimental data. <lb/> 10  1 <lb/> 10  2 <lb/> 10  3 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  0 <lb/> 10  2 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  6 <lb/> 10  8 <lb/> Events per year <lb/> Penetrating <lb/>muons <lb/>10  1 <lb/> 10  2 <lb/> 10  3 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> Number of collected photons <lb/>10  0 <lb/> 10  2 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  6 <lb/> 10  8 <lb/> ν <lb/> μ <lb/> 10  1 <lb/> 10  2 <lb/> 10  3 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  0 <lb/> 10  2 <lb/> 10  4 <lb/> 10  6 <lb/> 10  8 <lb/> Atmospheric <lb/>neutrinos <lb/> Fig. 2: Distribution of photon counts per event (roughly 1/10 of the deposited energy in GeV) at each stage of the selection, derived <lb/>from Monte Carlo simulation.

Pre-selection <lb/> The first stage of the event selection is done at the South Pole to reduce the data rate enough to transmit <lb/>over a satellite link; the resulting sample, shown in the left panel of Figure 2, includes ∼ 1% of all triggered <lb/>events.

The remaining selection steps remove this background, leaving a <lb/>nearly-pure sample of neutrino events. <lb/> 3.2. Veto <lb/> This selection targets neutrino interactions that occur inside the instrumented volume, producing a cas-<lb/>cade at the neutrino vertex as well as an out-going track in the case of CC ν μ  . These can be distinguished <lb/></body>

			<body> from incoming muons by rejecting events where photons are detected before the putative neutrino vertex. <lb/>The simplest approach is the one employed in [2], where the outermost layer of PMTs is used as an active <lb/>veto. If photons are detected on the outermost layer before the estimated vertex time, then the event is <lb/>rejected; spurious vetoes due to detector noise are mitigated by requiring the photons to be causally con-<lb/>nected to the estimated vertex and to fulfill a local coincidence condition [1]. For very bright events with <lb/>thousands of detected photons, this single cut is sufficient to suppress the muon background below the level <lb/>of atmospheric neutrinos (Figure 2, center panel). <lb/>As the energy threshold is lowered the number of background muons increases rapidly while their av-<lb/>erage energy loss rate decreases, a combination that overwhelms the ability of the single layer to reject <lb/>incoming muons. In order to extend the selection to lower energies, a second kind of veto is required. The <lb/>first modification is to remove the local coincidence requirement for veto photons. This allows isolated pho-<lb/>tons to veto an incoming track, which lowers the energy threshold but also loses signal events to spurious <lb/>vetoes caused by noise. In order to mitigate the signal loss, photons are only considered for veto if they <lb/>are detected at a time and position consistent with an incoming track but inconsistent with the reconstructed <lb/>cascade vertex, as shown in Figure 3a. This condition can only be effective if the incoming muon is correctly <lb/>reconstructed. <lb/> Photon from track <lb/>Track <lb/>detection <lb/>window <lb/>Vertex <lb/>Incoming <lb/>muon <lb/>Noise photon <lb/> (a) Penetrating muon before its largest <lb/>energy loss.

Photons induced <lb/>at the cascade vertex spread outwards <lb/>at the speed of light in ice, while the <lb/>muon moves at the speed of light in <lb/>vacuum. Eventually the muon out-<lb/>runs the light front from the cascade, <lb/>and photons collected in the track de-<lb/>tection window can be used to used to <lb/>positively identify an out-going muon <lb/>in the event. <lb/> Fig. 3: An illustration of the incoming-muon veto procedure. Each panel shows a snapshot in time with the current position of the <lb/>muon marked by the blue arrowhead and the position of the reconstructed vertex marked by a green star. (a) shows a penetrating muon <lb/>before its largest energy loss with a photon detection that counts towards the veto, while (b) shows the same configuration after the <lb/>largest energy loss with an ambiguous photon detection that does not count towards the veto. (c) shows how the technique can be <lb/>inverted to detect starting tracks. <lb/> The most resilient background comes from single muons with a single disproportionately large stochastic <lb/>energy loss. Such events can be completely dominated by the photons induced by the largest energy loss, <lb/>causing track reconstruction algorithms that expect a smooth track to fail to find the correct direction. The <lb/>position and time of the vertex can, however, be reconstructed reliably regardless of the presence of a <lb/>muon track. In order to ensure that veto photons will be found, the search is repeated for every possible <lb/>down-going direction that passes through the reconstructed vertex, and the track hypothesis with the largest <lb/>number of associated veto photons is considered the best. The event is rejected if the best track has more <lb/>than 2 associated photons. <lb/></body>

			<body> 3.3. Fiducial volume scaling <lb/> Since the effectiveness of the track-based veto is proportional to the probability of detecting at least 2 <lb/>photons from an incoming muon before the reconstructed vertex, it increases in proportion to the number <lb/>of detectable photons the muon induces and the number of PMTs it passes on its way to the vertex. This <lb/>relationship can be exploited to maintain sufficient penetrating muon rejection at low energies by requiring a <lb/>minimum distance between the reconstructed vertex and the edges of the instrumented volume that increases <lb/>as the number of collected photons decreases as shown in Figure 4. At the lowest photon counts the fiducial <lb/>volume is reduced to the DeepCore subarray with the remainder of the detector used as a veto; as the <lb/>photon count increases the veto reduces to the outermost layer of PMTs as in [2]. This selection creates the <lb/>neutrino-dominated sample shown in the right panel of Figure 2. <lb/> −0.6 −0.4 −0.2 0.0 <lb/> 0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>x [km] <lb/> −0.4 <lb/>−0.2 <lb/> 0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>y [km] <lb/> −0.6 −0.4 −0.2 0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>x [km] <lb/> −0.4 <lb/>−0.2 <lb/> 0.0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>z [km] <lb/> 100 PE <lb/>300 PE <lb/>1000 PE <lb/>2200 PE <lb/> Fig. 4: Scaling of the fiducial volume with collected photon count.

Right: Side view, showing the modules along strings. <lb/> 4. Analysis considerations <lb/> When applied to experimental data, the selection described above will yield a sample of events that <lb/>arises from a superposition of 4 sources: conventional atmospheric neutrinos, prompt atmospheric neutrinos, <lb/>penetrating atmospheric muons, and high-energy extraterrestrial neutrinos. These must be disentangled by <lb/>examining the distributions of distinguishing observables and finding the combination of input fluxes that <lb/>best describes the observed data. The most powerful of these are deposited energy, zenith angle, and the <lb/>presence or absence of an outgoing muon. <lb/> Deposited energy. The visible energy [5] deposited at the neutrino vertex provides a decent proxy for the <lb/>neutrino energy; for CC ν  e  interactions it is nearly identical to the neutrino energy, while for all other <lb/>interaction types it is on average proportional to the neutrino energy. Since the energy spectrum of prompt <lb/>atmospheric neutrinos follows the input cosmic ray spectrum while the conventional spectrum is steeper by <lb/>one power, a prompt component can appear as an excess of events with large deposited energies. There is, <lb/>however, an irreducible background from high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. While there is evidence that <lb/>an astrophysical flux exists, its source is unknown and the experimental constraints on its energy distribution <lb/>are quite weak: if the flux is modeled as a power law, the best fit is E <lb/> −2.2±0.4  [2]. It is quite possible <lb/>that additional low-energy data will reveal an even softer flux, mimicking the energy distribution expected <lb/></body>

			<body> from prompt atmospheric neutrinos. If the energy distributions are nearly identical, then the only hope for <lb/>disentangling the two components comes from the observed zenith distribution <lb/> 2 . <lb/> Zenith angle. At energies above 1 TeV, the end products of deep-inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering are <lb/>nearly collinear with the incoming neutrino [7], and the reconstructed directions of cascades and starting <lb/>tracks in the instrumented volume can be used to roughly infer the direction of the original neutrino. In <lb/>principle this would allow another simple way to distinguish a prompt component: the flux of conventional <lb/>neutrinos is strongly peaked at the horizon where air showers experience the smallest average atmospheric <lb/>density, while neutrinos from prompt decays are isotropically distributed. This simple picture is again <lb/>complicated by the astrophysical flux, which in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary must be <lb/>assumed to be isotropic as well. <lb/>While a soft, isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux can mimic a prompt atmospheric neutrino flux if <lb/>only neutrinos are considered, the air showers that produce atmospheric neutrinos also produce high-energy <lb/>muons [15]. Since the event selection removes penetrating atmospheric muons, it removes the fraction <lb/>of atmospheric neutrino events where a muon from the same air shower reaches the detector. While this <lb/>has no observable effect for neutrinos from the northern hemisphere where the bulk of the earth stops all <lb/>accompanying muons, it suppresses the observable atmospheric neutrino flux considerably in the southern <lb/>hemisphere, breaking the degeneracy between a prompt atmospheric and a soft, isotropic astrophysical flux. <lb/>Figure 5 shows the effect on the zenith distribution at various energies for both conventional and prompt <lb/>fluxes. The suppression is strongest at high energies and small zenith angles, where the typical energies of <lb/>accompanying muons are large and the ice overburden small. It is also much stronger for ν  μ  than for ν  e <lb/> because of the direct correlation between the energies of muon neutrinos and muons produced in the same <lb/>decay [15]. <lb/> Tracks vs. Cascades. The fraction of events with identifiable outgoing tracks can be used to infer the <lb/>relative contribution of ν μ  to the observed data. One simple way to separate events with outgoing tracks is to <lb/>invert the incoming-muon veto as shown in Figure 3c and search all directions for photons associated with <lb/>an outgoing track. Events with a large number of photons collected in the track-detection window can be <lb/>positively identified as ν μ  ; ν  e  , ν τ  , NC ν μ  , and a fraction of CC ν μ  events with unfortunate geometries will be <lb/>classified as cascades. This provides an additional constraint on the origin of excess events independent of <lb/>deposited energy and zenith angle, since the conventional atmospheric flux consists almost entirely of ν μ  , <lb/>the prompt flux of equal parts ν  e  and ν μ  , and an astrophysical flux likely of equal parts ν  e  , ν μ  , and ν τ  [17]. <lb/> 5. Outlook <lb/> Extending contained-event searches in IceCube to lower energies without sacrificing sensitivity to all <lb/>neutrino flavors or to the southern sky is challenging, but may reveal a more detailed picture of the transition <lb/>between the atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino fluxes than is currently possible using only high-energy <lb/>contained events or up-going tracks. Constraints on the flux of neutrinos from charmed meson decay derived <lb/>from the methods described here will, however, always depend on assumptions about the energy, angular, <lb/>and flavor distribution of the high-energy extraterrestrial neutrino flux. <lb/></body>
