			<body> 1. S-DALINAC <lb/> Around the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC [1] a multi-facetted nuclear-<lb/>physics program is realized. The S-DALINAC provides beam energies ranging from as low as 2.5 MeV up to <lb/>typically 80-90 MeV, peaked at the design value of 130 MeV. At the S-DALINAC, research is done in the areas <lb/>of nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, fundamental studies as well as the continuous upgrade of the accelerator, <lb/>strongly supported by a center of excellence funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

			<body> injector at energies between 2.5 MeV and 10 MeV with average beam currents of up to 60 μA [5] at the 10 MeV <lb/>bremsstrahlung facility. Recent fission studies [6] complete the experimental program at this site. <lb/>Passing the main linac increases the beam energy up to 50 MeV. The use of two recirculations yields a maximum <lb/>energy of 130 MeV. A high-resolution energy-loss spectrometer [7] for form-factor measurements [8] and a large-<lb/>acceptance QClam spectrometer for coincidence experiments [9] or single-arm scattering at 180 <lb/> •  [10] are available. <lb/>Photons are on hand at a high-resolution photon tagger [11] for astrophysically relevant photodisintegration and <lb/>photon scattering studies between 5 MeV and 20 MeV and at a bremsstrahlung site for about 50 -100 MeV electron <lb/>beams [12], currently prepared for an experiment on proton polarizability. <lb/>The research programme is extended by the implementation of a polarized electron source, unraveling the potential <lb/>for polarized electron and photon beams at low momentum transfer. First experiments to be performed are presented <lb/>in an overview given in Ref. [13]. <lb/> 2. Polarized Injector SPIN <lb/> A laser-driven strained-layer superlattice GaAs electron source [14] along the lines of Ref. [15] is the core of <lb/>the S-DALINAC polarized injector SPIN. First set up at an offline test stand site [16], where all components and <lb/>necessary procedures had been investigated, the electron gun and its beam line have been implemented at the S-<lb/>DALINAC between the unpolarized thermionic source and the injector linac in 2010. A new chopper-prebuncher <lb/>system has been set up and tested to match the 3 GHz time structure of the S-DALINAC, and a two-cell capture <lb/>cavity [17, 18] has been re-installed at the S-DALINAC injector for compensating the difference between the lower <lb/>(100 keV) injection energy of polarized electrons with respect to the unpolarized source (250 keV). Beam intensities <lb/>of up to 50 μA, cathode lifetimes of about 1000 hours, and small normalized emittances of about 0.15 mm mrad have <lb/>been achieved. A pulsed operation mode was demonstrated as well as spin rotation by a Wien filter. Utilizing a 100 <lb/>keV Mott polarimeter, a degree of polarization of about 86 (3) % was determined. <lb/>Two laser systems drive the source: a diode, optionally pulsed, for 3-GHz continuous-wave operation of the S-<lb/>DALINAC and a Ti:Sapphire laser aimed at short laser pulses in the femtosecond regime with repetition frequencies <lb/>of 75 MHz. The laser beam transport is done via optical fibre in case of the diode laser and a 40 m long evacuated <lb/>transfer line for the intense Ti:Sapphire beam. Various components have been developed, e.g., a spectrometer for <lb/>laser diagnostics, an autocorrelator for laser pulse length measurements, a Stokes polarimeter monitoring the degree <lb/>of polarization, and an active stabilization of pointing and centering through the beam transport line. <lb/> 3. Photofission experiments <lb/> A detailed microscopic theoretical understanding of the fission process has not been achieved yet [19]. In order to <lb/>gain insight, e.g., fissioning shape isomers or mass and total kinetic energy (TKE) distributions as well as fragment <lb/>angular distributions may be investigated. Detailed data may help elucidate the structure of intermediate states as <lb/>well as the shape of the fission barrier, guiding theoretical studies for a better microscopic description of fission <lb/>dynamics. Recently results on the mass and TKE distributions, parameterized in the fission-mode concept by Brosa et <lb/>al. [20], from photo-fission of <lb/> 234,238 U have been obtained [6]. These experiments were done using a twin Frisch-grid <lb/>ionization chamber [21] with a solid uranium target located at the common cathode. An important step for a correct <lb/>analysis is the determination of the fragment emission angle with respect to the target, which can be extracted from <lb/>the electron drift times to the anode [22]. Higher luminosities are desirable for a significant data improvement. <lb/>A different focus is the search for parity non-conservation (PNC) in the <lb/> 238 U(γ,f) reaction. Given the ratio of the <lb/>weak and strong coupling constants, a PNC strength of 10 <lb/> −7  is expected. Previous experiments with neutron-induced <lb/>fission have shown an enhancement to 10 <lb/> −4  [23, 24, 25]. Like in investigations on the helicity-dependent transmission <lb/>of polarized neutrons from various targets (see, e.g., ref. [26] for an overview), the high level density and the selective <lb/>excitation of states by low angular momentum transfer [27] is used to explain the enhancement. Even in the case of a <lb/>broad excitation spectrum detectable effects should exist, as argued by Flambaum and Gribakin [28] as well as Wettig <lb/>and Weidenmüller [29]. As the enhancement mechanism is not well understood, a high demand for new data using <lb/>a different probe is given. The recently installed polarized electron injector SPIN will match this need, producing <lb/>circularly polarized bremsstrahlung with a high degree of polarization close to the end-point energy, enabling the <lb/>search for forward-backward asymmetries of the light and heavy fission fragments. <lb/></body>

			<body> As a feasibility study first test experiments with unpolarized beam using a twin Frisch grid ionization cham-<lb/>ber were carried out [30]. The test experiments demonstrated the usefulness of an ion chamber at the 10 MeV <lb/>bremsstrahlung facility of the S-DALINAC, yet the required count rates were not achieved as indicated by the fission <lb/>yields. As the accelerator is limited to 60 μA, increasing the target thickness is mandatory, even with an upgrade to <lb/>150 μA [31] available in the future. Reaching higher luminosities thus requires a denser solid target, however, the <lb/>mass and angular resolutions deteriorate with increasing target thickness. Therefore, an active gas-target including <lb/>uranium atoms inside the counting gas is investigated. As UF 6 is available as a gas at temperatures above 56 <lb/> •  C, <lb/>different admixtures with common counting gases, e.g., argon, are studied. <lb/> 4. Active UF 6 gas-target <lb/> For this investigation, a test chamber for UF 6 -argon gas-mixtures has been built. The chamber was designed as <lb/>a single Frisch-grid ionization chamber with a distance D = 4.2 cm between cathode and grid, and a distance of 1 cm <lb/>between grid and anode. <lb/>As UF 6 is highly hygroscopic and easily forms hydrofluoric acid with even the slightest amount of water vapor, <lb/>all installed elements of the chamber have been baked to 200 <lb/> •  C for at least 12 hours to reduce water content. A high <lb/>resistance against corrosion is mandatory, too. Hence, for safety reasons, all conducting parts inside the chamber are <lb/>stainless steel (AISI 316L), and all insulators are polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). A leak test has been carried out <lb/>showing an integral helium leak rate of 9.1 · 10 <lb/> −10  (mbar · l)/s, keeping water vapor at a minimum after emptying the <lb/>chamber while ensuring no contamination in the experimental area. After assuring the leak tightness, the chamber was <lb/>flushed with argon for more than half an hour at a moderate flow rate to remove any residual gas impurities. Thereafter <lb/>the chamber was evacuated and then filled with argon of purity 6.0 equivalent to a volume of 950 mln (volume in ml <lb/>under normal conditions). <lb/>A triple alpha source containing <lb/> 239 Pu, <lb/> 241 Am and <lb/> 244 Cu is used for energy calibration purposes, emitting alpha <lb/>particles at energies of 5155 keV, 5480 keV and 5795 keV, respectively. The alpha source is mounted on a stainless <lb/>steel disk on the cathode plane inside the ionization chamber and fixed into position with a PTFE fitting. Electrons <lb/>created by the energy loss of charged particles inside the active gas volume produce a signal at the anode proportional <lb/>to the deposited energy. With the shielding inefficiency of the grid taken into account, an energy calibration of the <lb/>chamber can be obtained. A typical charged particle inside the active volume has its charge center of gravity position <lb/>denoted by X. The ratio X/D defines the signal suppression induced at the cathode relative to the anode signal and <lb/>therefore the emission angle of the charged particle can be deducted. <lb/> 5. Experimental Results <lb/> First the functionality of the chamber at different temperatures between 30 <lb/> •  C and 70 <lb/> •  C has been tested. Signal <lb/>quality as well as electron drift velocities were evaluated and an energy calibration was needed. Due to the dimensions <lb/>of the chamber, only low-energy alpha particles are completely stopped inside the active volume. The produced <lb/>electrons drift along the field lines towards the anode, inducing a signal on the cathode. Special attention was given <lb/>to the signal quality, which is visible in Fig. 1 (a). Clearly separated signals can be seen in the two-dimensional plot, <lb/>indicating a high resolution due to a pure argon atmosphere with no air impurities. The events in Fig. 1 (a) can be <lb/>used to create an energy spectrum, allowing for an energy calibration, confer Fig. 2 (a). Another important quantity <lb/>is the drift velocity of the electrons in the active volume. This value was measured at a temperature of 70 <lb/> •  C and a gas <lb/>volume of 950 mln. Normalized to the pressure, results for different electric field strengths are shown in Fig. 3 (a). <lb/>The behavior of the drift velocity is typical for argon, with a peak value at a small reduced electric field strength of <lb/>around 100 V(cm · atm) and saturation at higher field strengths, as can be seen in Fig. 3 (a). <lb/>The next step was to test different mixtures of argon gas and small amounts of UF 6 . First one mass per cent of <lb/>uranium, added as UF 6 to an argon volume of 1055 mln, was investigated, later the uranium content was increased to <lb/>two mass percent, in order to study the behavior of the gas mixture with respect to signal quality and electron drift <lb/>velocity. Figure 1 (b) gives an indication of the signal quality with an amount of two mass per cent uranium in the <lb/>system. Obviously, adding UF 6 to the argon gas distorts the signals. As can be seen the mean free range of the alpha <lb/>particles from the calibration source now exceeds the dimensions of the chamber. Therefore, the alpha particles are <lb/></body>

At lower energies, two lines of lower intensity with <lb/>respect to the calibration source can be seen. Apparently, they originate from the alpha decays of <lb/> 238 U and <lb/> 234 U, <lb/>respectively, taking place close to or on the surface of the electrodes. Overall, many events may be identified, as UF 6 <lb/> is distributed over the entire active volume, thus creating background in the energy spectrum. Events with low cathode <lb/>pulse height are probably due to UF 6 molecules frozen out on the electrodes. <lb/>Figure 2 (b) shows the energy spectrum of the calibration source obtained with an argon / UF 6 mixture (two mass <lb/>per cent uranium). Due to the higher alpha radioactivity in the counting gas the background noise level increases. <lb/>Corresponding to the additional lines in Fig. 1 (b) visible energy peaks for <lb/> 238 U and <lb/> 234 U, respectively, show up at <lb/>energies below the calibration source. With a specific activity of 12.2 kBq/g and an estimated mass of 60 mg, the <lb/>alpha activity of the <lb/> 238 U content in the chamber should be about 730 Bq. Although the calculated activity of the <lb/> 238 U <lb/>is in the same order of magnitude as the activity of the calibration nuclides, which is around 1 kBq each, the visible <lb/>energy peak for <lb/> 238 U is about two orders of magnitude lower than the calibration peaks.

Air impurities <lb/>might have entered the chamber during the gas filling process, propably due to a contamination of the UF 6 sample. <lb/>This could be a possible explanation of the observed anti-correlation between anode and cathode pulse height as <lb/>seen by the slight inclination to the left (cf. Fig. 1 (b)). Nevertheless, this is still under investigation in a second <lb/>measurement campaign with a renewed gas mixture. <lb/>Two different sets of measurements for varying UF 6 concentrations of one and two mass per cent of uranium <lb/>inside the active volume were taken. The results from the electron drift-velocity measurement are shown in Fig. 3 (b) <lb/>as a function of reduced field strength. As a reference corresponding values of pure argon data are included. All three <lb/>data sets show a comparable behavior at small field strengths. In the case of the argon / UF 6 mixture the drift velocity <lb/>at higher field strengths increases with growing uranium concentration, eventually leading to saturation effects. <lb/> 6. Outlook <lb/> The operation of an ionization chamber with a gas mixture of argon with up to two mass per cent uranium in <lb/>the form of UF 6 has been demonstrated. Signals from a triple alpha source in the energy range of 5-6 Mev are well <lb/>resolved after adding some UF 6 content to the gas mixture. During the UF 6 filling procedure, a signal distortion could <lb/>be seen, an effect, which seemed to recover after some time. This might result from a slight contamination of the <lb/>uranium sample and could possibly be solved by a second argon flushing. In the future, the counting-gas properties <lb/>of Ar + UF 6 at higher uranium concentrations of up to 60 mass per cent uranium will be investigated, where the <lb/>target thickness of the active target would be equivalent to a solid target with a thickness of around 1 mg/cm <lb/> 2 , as <lb/>required for high-quality photo-fission data, therefore necessary for the search for PNC effects. Other issues to be <lb/>investigated are the performance of the active target over a long time period, the reproducibility of the gas behavior <lb/>as well as test experiments taking photofission data in a bremsstrahlung beam. Some efforts may be taken to improve <lb/>data collection, e.g., sampling the signals with fast ADCs and improving the signal granularity. Therefore segmented <lb/>electrode designs are currently under investigation, and a readout system for a larger number of channels is under <lb/>construction. <lb/></body>
