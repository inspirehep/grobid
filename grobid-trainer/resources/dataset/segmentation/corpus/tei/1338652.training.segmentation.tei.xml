			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/> Until recently, in elementary-particle physics there existed the opinion that <lb/>theories with unrenormalizable interactions belong to non-local theories [see, e.g., <lb/>Ref. (I)]. However, recent investigations (2)-(7) have shown that there exists a <lb/>large class of such unrenormalizable interactions which can be described in the <lb/>framework of local theories. In so doing we note that a strict formulation of the <lb/>locality principle can be made in different ways but always it is closely associated <lb/>with those spaces of the generalized and test functions on the basis of which the <lb/>theory studied is constructed. <lb/>In investigating renormalizable interactions one needs to consider the space <lb/>of tempered distributions. In order to describe unrenormalizable interactions it is <lb/>necessary to deal with a quite different space of distribution. Correspondingly, the <lb/>space of test functions is also changed. <lb/>Detailed investigations devoted to the formulation of unrenormalizable theories <lb/>basing on a new space of generalized and test functions were made by Jaffe, <lb/>Meyman, Guttinger, and Efimov (2)-(7). <lb/>We do not dwell here upon the details of these papers. We note only that they <lb/>are characterized first of all by the departure beyong the framework of the tempered <lb/>distributions determined on the space of test functions S [the Schwartz space <lb/>(I), (8)-(IO)]. In the present paper we use the definition of the locality condition <lb/>given in Refs. (J)-(7). The definition by Jaffe somewhat differs from the others. <lb/>Instead of the space of the test functions S, which was used in renormalizable <lb/>theories, we consider the space Z of analytic functions on which the distributions <lb/>of fast increase are determined. These are characteristic of unrenormalizable <lb/></body>

			<body>interactions. We investigate the two-point <lb/>Green&apos;s function of scalar particles <lb/>which, like the scattering amplitude, in unrenormalizable <lb/>field theories can be <lb/>written in the form <lb/>where de(x) is the causal Green&apos;s function of a free scalar field. The function which <lb/>is similar to (1.1) was studied, e.g., in Refs. (4), (5), (12). <lb/>The locality condition following the authors of Refs. (3)-(G) imposes the following <lb/>requirements on the coefficients of the series (1.1): <lb/>lim 1 a, lljn = 0. <lb/>n-a <lb/>(1.2) <lb/>Starting from this locality condition further we shall establish the boundary <lb/>between local and non-local interactions. <lb/>In the present paper the Fourier transform of eq. (1.1) is constructed. In other <lb/>words, we have determined the value of the distribution (1.1) on the function <lb/>eipe belonging to the space of test functions 2. Beforehand, we find for (1.1) such <lb/>an integral representation which allows us to pass easily to the momentum space. <lb/>Both local and non-local unrenormalizable interactions are studied. The problem <lb/>associated with the unambiguity of the procedure suggested is considered. It is <lb/>found that for non-local interactions a Fourier transform can be constructed either <lb/>unambiguously or with the accuracy up to one arbitrary parameter. Among local <lb/>interactions one has found a rather wide class of such interactions which allow <lb/>one to make an unambigous transition from the configuration space to the momen-<lb/>tum one. <lb/>A method developed here is applicable to a large number of theories which <lb/>describe unrenormalizable interactions (12)-(20). <lb/> 2. NON-LOCAL <lb/>UNRENORMALIZABLE <lb/>INTERACTIONS <lb/> We write the two-point Green&apos;s function in the form <lb/>@Ax&gt; = i f c(n)[Ll,C(x)l &quot; . <lb/>2 <lb/>(2.1) <lb/>Our main task is the construction of the Fourier transform of this expression. The <lb/>term with n = 1 is not considered since its Fourier transform is easily found. <lb/>In the case of non-local interaction, the coefficients c(n) obey the condition <lb/>lim PP 1 c(n)lll &quot; = A, <lb/>(2.2) <lb/>n+m <lb/></body>

			<body> where A is a non-zero constant, b obeys the condition 2 &gt; b &gt; 0. We may introduce <lb/>for these interactions the concept of &quot; elementary length 1 &quot; (6). <lb/>Instead of (2.2) we will require still stronger condition to be fulfilled. Namely, an <lb/>integer functionf(z) represented by the power series <lb/> (2.3) <lb/> must be restricted in a certain sector 1 c$ / &lt; , <lb/>E E 3 0, z = rei*. We call this require-<lb/>ment condition (2.3). It will be shown below that, from (2.3), the condition <lb/>(2.2) follows. <lb/>For [i&amp;c(x)] &quot; <lb/> we have the following integral representation in terms of the phase <lb/>volume 52~~Q2) of n-scalar particles (21): <lb/>For the case of massless particles the equality (2.4) looks very simple, <lb/> 27Ti(- 1) <lb/> h- &quot; = 4 &quot; lyn) F(n -1) I <lb/> m c2(p242~~~~ <lb/> 0 <lb/> (2.4) <lb/>(2.5) <lb/> Here H: &quot; )(pdx) is the Hankel function, r(n) is the Gamma function, x = x2 -i6 <lb/>(6 is an infinitesimal positive value). Just this case will be considered below. <lb/>The expression (2.1) taking into account (2.4) is of the form <lb/>or for m = 0, <lb/> In order that the Fourier transform of the function Q,-,(x) be meaningful we intro-<lb/>duse the cutoff for large p2 (p2 &lt; M2 &lt; co), <lb/>@oreg(X) = -f (-1) &quot; jr&apos; y F(n, /.L2) due(x), <lb/> 1 <lb/> where <lb/> (2.8) <lb/>(2.9) <lb/></body>

			<body> Now using the value of F(n, p2) in a given sequence of points n = 1,2, 3,..., we <lb/>try to reconstruct the analytic function which is regular in the right half-plane <lb/> Rez &gt; 0 and obeys the conditions (z = x + iy) <lb/>(4 <lb/> 1 F(z, p &quot; )l &lt; Be &quot; 1 &quot; 1(Rez 2 0); <lb/>F(x, ~ &quot; 1 -0 <lb/>(x--t a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>j F(iy, p &quot; )/ &lt; Be( &quot; -E)Ivi <lb/>(-co&lt;y&lt;co,E&gt;O). <lb/>(2.10) <lb/>(2.11) <lb/> If such a function is constructed, then @ ,, &amp;x) can be represented in the form <lb/> M2 <lb/>@i,re&amp;&gt; <lb/>= <lb/>f ,. &quot; ;:I <lb/>&amp; <lb/>j, <lb/>$ <lb/>m <lb/>p2) <lb/>4Y.4 <lb/> (0 &lt; 01 &lt; 1) (2.12) <lb/>This representation is very convenient for the construction of the Fourier transform <lb/>of the function QO(x). <lb/>It turns out that the conditions (2.10) and (2.11) are enough so that there exists <lb/>no more than one F(z, p2) function with given values of F(n, p &quot; ) (22), (23). There are <lb/>various methods for constructing an integer function with given values (22), (23). <lb/> We choose a method basing on the following theorem (22). <lb/> THEOREM 1. Let n be a sequence of natural numbers and F(z, p2) satisfies the <lb/>conditions (2.10) and (2.11). Then for a rather large q the function F(z, p2) can be <lb/>represented in the form <lb/> F(z, p2) = =$ <lb/>1 jm P,(x) e-zs dx + egZ f (- 1) &quot;  nF(n, p2) z/, <lb/>(2.13) <lb/>--P <lb/>1 <lb/>uphere P,(z) is the analytic function which is represented in a rather distant half-plane <lb/> Re z &lt; a by the Dirichlet series <lb/>P,(z) = 2 (- 1) &quot;  nF(n, p2) enZ. <lb/>1 <lb/>(2.14) <lb/> The function F(z, pcL2) unambiguously reconstructed by the values F(n, $) with <lb/>the help of Theorem I can be written in the form <lb/>where the function c(z) at the integer points along the real positive axis assumes the <lb/>values c(n). <lb/>The conditions under which Theorem I is valid impose certain restrictions on <lb/>the coefficients c(n). Let us find them. <lb/></body>

			<body> The convergence of the Dirichlet series in the half-plane Re z &lt; a is rather well-<lb/>ensured by the condition (2.2) for any positive a. <lb/>Another important requirement for which Eq. (2.13) is valid is that the sum of <lb/>the Dirichlet series (2.14) should be continued analytically throughout the band <lb/>1 Im z 1 &lt; E and be limited in it. This condition is closely connected with the condi-<lb/>tion (2,11). Let us look what restrictions it imposes on the coefficients c(n). <lb/>We compare the Dirichlet series (2.14) with the power series which is derived <lb/>from the former by replacing the variables u = ez <lb/> m <lb/> P,(u) = c (-l)% nF(n, 1 &quot; s) vn. <lb/>Then the condition of limitedness for the Dirichlet series (2.14) in the band <lb/>/ Im z 1 &lt; E is similar to that for the power series (2.15) in the sector 1 4 / &lt; E(U = <lb/>reid). From the theory of integer functions we know the following (the Phragmen-<lb/>Lindelbf theorems): For the integer function to be limited in a certain sector it is <lb/>necessary that the order of its increase obey the condition p 3 9. (For p = 4, the <lb/>sector transforms into a ray). <lb/>Now to derive the condition on c(n) it is sufficient to make use of the Theorem <lb/>2 (22). <lb/> THEOREM 2. Let <lb/>then <lb/>lim nllo 1 d, 11/n = (ecrp)&apos;l &quot; <lb/>n-m <lb/>and, on the contrary,from (2.17), itfollows (2.16) (Mp(r) = max I p(u) I). <lb/>The equality (2.17) as applied to (2.15) gives the following relation: <lb/>Fim n2-b 1 nF(n, p2)11in = (&amp;12-&apos; <lb/>($ = 2 -B), <lb/>(2.16) <lb/>(2.17) <lb/>(2.18) <lb/>where 2 &gt; b &gt; 0 what follows from the condition p 3 fr. Hence for the coefficients <lb/>c(n) we have <lb/>lim rb 1 c(n)l+ = (-f$)2 t&amp;j&apos;_, <lb/>(2.19) <lb/>n-m <lb/></body>

			<body> Let us compare the equality obtained with (2.2) and (2.3). We see that for theories <lb/>with non-local interactions the function F(z, p2) is unambiguously reconstructed by <lb/>its values at integer points along the real positive axis. <lb/>Using the function F(z, ~2) (2.9)&apos; we write CD,, r&amp;x) in the form <lb/> M2 <lb/> @,,reg(x) = ; j:+;I dz (47T)-2Z &apos;(&apos; + &apos;) <lb/>j <lb/>dp2(p2)+l due(x). (2.20) <lb/>sin ~TZ~(Z) r(z + 1) 0 <lb/>Now we go over to the momentum space. Since all the integrals are absolutely con-<lb/>vergent when we make the Fourier transformation <lb/>of (2.20) then this operation <lb/>can be directly applied to Atic( <lb/>Then we have <lb/>The mass M2 can be let to infinity. The expression (2.21) may be then considered <lb/>as the spectral representation of the two-point function G&amp;J). It ensures the uni-<lb/>tarity of the theory. <lb/>The integral over p2 is easily taken and for 6Jp) we have one more representation <lb/>in the form of the Mellin-Barnes <lb/>integral (24) <lb/>p2 + it5 <lb/>) <lb/>z <lb/>%(P) = -f (p2 ; is) ja-&apos;m dz -&amp;&amp; <lb/> ( <lb/> c(z + 1). <lb/>(2.22) <lb/> irfim <lb/> r(z)(;;2+ <lb/>1) <lb/>The remaining integral reduces to the sum of double residues at integer points of <lb/>the real axis. Finally we have <lb/>&amp;l(P) = &amp; <lb/>$ (-&apos;;z,f* <lb/>) &quot; c(n + &apos;) /ln ( p;~j~8 <lb/>emiT) <lb/>n! (n -I)! <lb/> + [In c(n + I)]&apos; -&apos;U(n) -y@z + 111; <lb/> (2.23) <lb/>Y(n) is the Euler function. From the formula obtained it is seen that the two-point <lb/>function (2.1) with the coefficients c(n) &gt; 0 in the momentum space is expressed <lb/>in terms of an alternating series. This function has a cut in the p2 plane with the <lb/>branching point for p2 = 0. The discontinuity on the cut is an integer function of <lb/>p2 expressed by an alternating power series. <lb/>The spectral function expressed by the series of constant sign corresponds to the <lb/>Green&apos;s function x0(x) <lb/>x0(x) = i f c(n)[-idoe(x) <lb/>(2.24) <lb/></body>

			<body> Let us find the Fourier transform of this function. To this end we write it down in <lb/>the form which is similar to (2.8) for the function Q9, rep(x) <lb/> XoredX) <lb/>= f Jr&apos; 5 I;(&amp; p&apos;) due(x), <lb/> 1 <lb/> (2.25) <lb/> where F(n, $) is given in (2.9). Using these values we can reconstruct the function <lb/>F(z, @) regular in the right half-plane Re z &gt; 0 and obeying the conditions (2.10) <lb/>and (2.11). Therefore for (2.5) we have the integral representation <lb/> Xoreg(X) <lb/>= 4 <lb/> s <lb/>cos 7rz <lb/>dZ -<lb/>M2 !@ <lb/>F(z, <lb/>p2) duyx), <lb/> L <lb/> sin 7rz s o p2 <lb/> (2.26) <lb/> The contour L being given, in Fig. 1. To construct the Fourier transform for this <lb/>quantity it is necessary beforehand to straighten the contour L so that it goes in <lb/>parallel with the imaginary axis in the band 0 &lt; Re z &lt; 1. It is impossible to <lb/>perform this operation directly in the integral (2.26). However an intermediate <lb/>procedure used in Ref.

LOCAL <lb/>NONRENORMALIZABLE <lb/>INTERACTIONS <lb/> Now we consider the two-point function Q,,(x) when its coefficients satisfy the <lb/>locality condition <lb/>lim j c(n)l+ = 0. <lb/> (3.1) <lb/>n-m <lb/> The condition (3.1) is in contradiction with the condition (2.18). Therefore in the <lb/>given case using the values of F(n, p2) it is impossible to reconstruct the analytic <lb/>function regular in the right half-plane Re z &gt; 0 and satisfying the conditions <lb/>(2.10) and (2.11). <lb/>We restrict ourselves to the study of such local interactions in which 1 ~(n)ll/~ <lb/>tends to zero as a finite inverse power n, <lb/> !ii~ nk / c(n)l&apos;l &quot; <lb/>= A, <lb/> A &gt; 0, <lb/>k &gt; 0. <lb/>(3.2) <lb/> Using this restriction we remain in the framework of the most interesting cases of <lb/>local unrenormalizable interactions [see, e.g., (13)-(20)]. <lb/>For the function o,,(x) with coefficients satisfying the condition (3.2) we suggest <lb/>the following prescription for the transition to the momentum space. <lb/></body>

			<body> Let us introduce into F(n, p2) the parameter y <lb/> (3.3) <lb/> For y = I r;Y(n, p2) transforms into .F(n, p2). The condition (2.18) as applied to <lb/>F,,(n, p2) has the form <lb/> grn n2-b 1 nF,(n, pz)llln = (&amp;j2mb <lb/>(2 &gt; b 2 0). <lb/> From here for the coefficients c(y) we have <lb/> (3.4) <lb/>(3.5) <lb/> Choosing the parameter y so that it lies in the interval 0 &lt; y &lt; 1 - b/2 we can <lb/>obtain that the conditions (3.1) and (3.4) will be satisfied simultaneously.

The difference between local and non-local interactions is that in the <lb/>former the spectral function increases at infinity over the whole p2-plane, while in <lb/>the latter there is a domain depending on h in which it decreases. For the interactions <lb/>in which the coefficients c(n) are expressed in terms of the powers of the Gamma <lb/>functions the functions 8jo(p) and go(p) are the Maijer&apos;s G-functions.

STUDY <lb/>OF UNAMBIGUITY <lb/>OF THE METHOD <lb/> The introduction of the intermediate parametrization necessary for constructing <lb/>the Fourier transforms of the functions @&amp;) and x,,(x) in local theories and for <lb/>constructing x0(x) in nonlocal ones results in the appearance of a certain ambiguity. <lb/>We describe it taking as an example local interactions. <lb/>The coefficients c(n) in terms of which the functions $(x) and x,,(x) are expressed <lb/>can be written in the form <lb/>c&apos;(n) = c(n) + a(n) sin m. <lb/> (4.1) <lb/> It is obvious that c&apos;(n) = c(n) and the functions @A(x) and X&amp;X) expressed through <lb/>new coefficients do not change. However, introducing the parameter y, the equality <lb/>c&apos;(n) = c(n) is violated and after returning to the value y = 1, the Fourier trans-<lb/>forms @,(p) and f;(p) differ from the former by the integer functions of p2 which <lb/>are <lb/> A(p21 = j&amp;g <lb/>c (--lP <lb/>( p;4$s <lb/>j &quot; .;:n,r <lb/>y)! <lb/> for the function C&amp;,(P) and <lb/> B(P&apos;) = <lb/>(4.2) <lb/>(4.3) <lb/> for the function z;(p). <lb/> The imaginary parts 6,,(p) and g,,(p) and consequently the <lb/>spectral functions are determined unambiguously. <lb/>In nonlocal theories 6,,(p) are determined unambiguously and the arbitrariness <lb/>in the determination of &amp;(p) can be reduced to one arbitrary parameter applying <lb/>the method of analytic continuation with respect to the coupling constant to the <lb/>expression (2.23). Let us demonstrate this. <lb/>We write the coefficients c(n) in the form <lb/> c(n) = (g2) &quot; h(n). <lb/> (4.4) <lb/> Then (2.23) takes the form <lb/>+ (In h(n + 1))&apos; -Y(n) -y(n + 1):. <lb/> (4.5) <lb/></body>

			<body> 5. CASE OF MASSIVE <lb/>PARTICLE <lb/> In the case of massive particles we find an asymptotic expression for the two-point <lb/>Green&apos;s function in the momentum space at p2 + co for local unrenormalizable <lb/>interaction. <lb/>Let us consider the function xm(x) with the coefficients c(n) obeying (3.1) <lb/>X?JX) = ; f (--I) &quot; s <lb/>0 + 1) j; +l)m~2 dp252!$(p2) LlilC(X). <lb/>(5.1) <lb/> 1 <lb/>n <lb/> Since we are interested in the asymptotics of&amp;(p) <lb/>at pe + co, then, as is seen e.g. <lb/>from (3.14), the main contribution is given by the integral over pz at large values of <lb/>pL2. Therefore one may use the following approximate formula: <lb/>(5.2) <lb/>where (26) <lb/>R(n, p2) = cos rrn 6 <lb/>t <lb/>j <lb/>2TL c(n + 1) <lb/>n! (n -l)! <lb/>11 + n(n -1) [$j &quot; <lb/> x [In ($j &quot; + Y(n) + Y(H -1) -Y(1) -Y(2)]/. <lb/>(5.3) <lb/>Introducing the parameter y and performing the procedure described in Section 3 <lb/>we get for the Fourier transform <lb/> &quot; g <lb/>R&amp;, p2) <lb/> 4m2 <lb/>p,2 <lb/>p,2 -p2 <lb/> -ia&apos; <lb/> (5.4) <lb/>Integrating (5.4) over p2 and z and going over to the limits y = 1, p2 &gt; m2, we <lb/>arrive at an expression similar to (2.30). The faster the descrease of the coefficients <lb/>c(n) for n + co the smaller the difference between them. <lb/> 6. EXAMPLES <lb/>OF INTERACTIONS <lb/> To illustrate the method developed by us we consider some specific unrenor-<lb/>malizable interactions. <lb/>We first consider the pseudovector interaction of the spinor field #(x) with <lb/>pseudoscalar meson field 4(x), <lb/>-WI = =%(W, <lb/>K4&gt; -k : S(x) Y~WKX) Wx): <lb/>(6.1) <lb/></body>

CONCLUSION <lb/> Thus, the unitary method of the construction of the Fourier transform for the <lb/>two-point Green&apos;s functions in theories with unrenormalizable <lb/>interactions has <lb/>been developed. The spectral representations of these functions have been found. <lb/>The behaviour of the spectral functions for large momenta has been described. <lb/>The results obtained here for local theories are somewhat close to those obtained <lb/>by Guttinger (4), (5). However, there are serious differences. We obtain nonanalytic <lb/>dependence of the two-point functions on the coupling constant in the momentum <lb/>space while this dependence is absent in Guttinger&apos;s results. This is due to the fact <lb/>that our method is applied to the two-point Green&apos;s function as a whole, while the <lb/>method developed in (4), (5) operates on each order in g2 independently, what <lb/>violate the structure of all the function. We consider that nonanalytic dependence <lb/>of the physical quantities on the coupling constant is a characteristic feature of <lb/>all the unrenormalizable theories (6), (19), (27), (28). <lb/>Besides, in Refs. (4), (5), one has not eliminated the functional ambiguity which <lb/>arises in constructing the Fourier transform of the two-point Green&apos;s function. <lb/></body>
