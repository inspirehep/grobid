			<front> 30TH INTERNATIONAL COSMIC RAY CONFERENCE <lb/> Search for point-like Dark Matter sources with the GLAST Large Area Telescope <lb/> A.MORSELLI <lb/> 1  ON BEHALF OF THE GLAST LAT COLLABORATION. <lb/> 1  INFN Roma Tor Vergata, Via della Ricerca Scientifica 1 I00133 ROMA, ITALY <lb/> aldo.morselli@roma2.infn.it <lb/> Abstract: The space satellite GLAST is expected to play a crucial role in indirect Dark Matter (DM) <lb/>searches, thanks both to its ability to perform observations at energy scales comparable to the mass of <lb/>common DM candidates and to its potential of making deep full-sky maps in gamma-rays, thanks to its <lb/>large (∼ 2.4 sr) field-of-view. Here we will describe the prospects for detecting gamma-rays from point <lb/>sources of Dark Matter annihilation. <lb/></front>

			<body> Introduction <lb/> The GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT) de-<lb/>sign and science prospects will be illustrated <lb/>in [1]. Here we would like to point out that the <lb/>GLAST-LAT collaboration pursues complemen-<lb/>tary searches for Dark Matter, each presenting its <lb/>own challenges and advantages. The center of <lb/>our own galaxy is a formidable astrophysical tar-<lb/>get to search for a Dark Matter signal, the rea-<lb/>son being that simulations of Dark Matter halos <lb/>predict high densities at the center of the galaxy <lb/>and since the WIMP annihilation rate is propor-<lb/>tional to the density squared, significant fluxes can <lb/>be expected. On the other hand, establishing a <lb/>signal requires identification of the high energy <lb/>gamma-ray sources which are close (or near) the <lb/>center and also an adequate modeling of the galac-<lb/>tic diffuse emission due to cosmic rays colliding <lb/>with the interstellar medium. The latter is even <lb/>more crucial for establishing a WIMP annihila-<lb/>tion signal from the galactic halo. The LAT ca-<lb/>pability to detect a gamma-ray flux coming from <lb/>WIMP pair annihilations in diffuse astrophysical <lb/>sources and from extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray <lb/>radiation and line searches from annihilation into <lb/>gamma-gamma and/or gamma-Z final states will <lb/>be discussed in [2]. <lb/>We focus now on a theoretically particularly well-<lb/>motivated type of Weakly Interacting Massive Par-<lb/>ticle (WIMP) dark matter candidate, the neu-<lb/>tralino (see [3] for a classic review) that appears <lb/>in most supersymmetric extensions to the Stan-<lb/>dard Model as the lightest supersymmetric parti-<lb/>cle (LSP) and is given by a linear combination of <lb/>the superpartners of the gauge and Higgs fields. <lb/>The most restrictive supersymmetric extension of <lb/>the Standard Model is the minimal supergravity <lb/>(mSUGRA) framework that has five input param-<lb/>eters: m  1/2  , m  0  , sign(µ), A  0  and tan β , <lb/> where m  0  is the common scalar mass, m  1/2  is the <lb/>common gaugino mass and A  0  is the proportional-<lb/>ity factor between the supersymmetry breaking tri-<lb/>linear couplings and the Yukawa couplings. tan β <lb/> denotes the ratio of the vacuum expectation val-<lb/>ues of the two neutral components of the SU(2) <lb/>Higgs doublet, while the Higgs mixing µ is de-<lb/>termined (up to a sign) by imposing the Electro-<lb/>Weak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) conditions at <lb/>the weak scale. The parameters at the weak en-<lb/>ergy scale are determined by the evolution of those <lb/>at the unification scale, according to the renormal-<lb/>ization group equations (RGEs). For this purpose, <lb/>we have made use of the ISASUGRA RGE pack-<lb/>age in the ISAJET 7.64 software [4]. After fix-<lb/>ing the five mSUGRA parameters at the unifica-<lb/>tion scale, we extract from the ISASUGRA out-<lb/>put the weak-scale supersymmetric mass spectrum <lb/>and the relative mixings. Cases in which the light-<lb/>est neutralino is not the lightest supersymmetric <lb/>particle or there is no radiative EWSB are disre-<lb/>garded. The ISASUGRA output is then used as an <lb/>input in the DarkSUSY package . The latter is <lb/>exploited to: a) reject models which violate lim-<lb/></body>

GLAST <lb/>3σ sensitivity is shown at the blue line and below. The lower right plot shows the comparison for tan β = 55 <lb/> with LHC, LC and the antimatter experiment PAMELA. The stripped regions correspond to models that are <lb/>excluded either by incorrect ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB), LEP bounds violations or because <lb/>the neutralino is not the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP). <lb/>its recommended by the Particle Data Group 2002 <lb/>(PDG) b) compute the neutralino relic abundance, <lb/>with full numerical solution of the density evolu-<lb/>tion equation including resonances, threshold ef-<lb/>fects and all possible coannihilation processes [5] <lb/>c) compute the neutralino annihilation rate at zero <lb/>temperature in all kinematically allowed tree-level <lb/>final states (including fermions, gauge bosons and <lb/>Higgs bosons); d) estimate the induced gamma-<lb/>ray yield by linking to the results of the simula-<lb/>tions performed with the Lund Monte Carlo pro-<lb/>gram Pythia as implemented in the DarkSUSY <lb/> package. Figure 1 shows our estimates of GLAST <lb/>sensitivity to a dark matter signal via the obser-<lb/>vation of WIMP annihilation photons (continuum <lb/>spectrum) in the m  1/2  and m  0  mSUGRA param-<lb/>eter plane for tan β = 10, 55 and 60. These <lb/>figures have been obtained performing a detailed <lb/>scan in the mSUGRA parameter space, computing <lb/>for each model the neutralino induced γ-ray flux <lb/>and the relic density. The lower right plot shows <lb/>the comparison for tan β = 55 with the exclu-<lb/>sion limits from LHC, LC [6] and the antimatter <lb/>experiment PAMELA [7]. The values of the neu-<lb/>tralino mass is also shown in both figures on the <lb/>right. For the region in red, the cosmologically <lb/>allowed WIMP region, the signal above the blue <lb/>line (M  W IMP  ∼ 200GeV ) is not observable by <lb/>GLAST due the higher WIMP mass as one moves <lb/>to higher m  1/2  .

The white region is allowed by <lb/>EGRET data and detectable by GLAST <lb/>the GLAST indirect search sensitivity estimate is <lb/>a truncated Navarro Frank and White (NFW) halo <lb/>profile as used in [8]. For steeper halo profiles <lb/>(like the Moore profile) the GLAST limits move <lb/>up, covering a wider WMAP [9] allowed region, <lb/>while for less steep profile (like the isothermal pro-<lb/>file) the GLAST limits move down, covering less <lb/>WMAP allowed region. <lb/> Model Independent GLAST Reach <lb/> The expression of the γ-ray continuum flux for a <lb/>generic WIMP at a given photon energy E is given <lb/>by <lb/> φ  wimp  (E) = <lb/> σv <lb/> 4π <lb/> f <lb/> dN  f <lb/> dE <lb/>B  f <lb/> l.o.s <lb/> dl <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ρ(l) <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  2 <lb/>wimp <lb/> (1) <lb/>This flux depends from the WIMP mass m  wimp  , <lb/>the total annihilation cross section times WIMP <lb/>velocity σv and through the sum of all the pho-<lb/>ton yield dN  f  /dE per each annihilation channel <lb/>weighted by the corresponding branching ratio B  f  . <lb/>The flux (1) also depends from the WIMP density <lb/>in the galactic halo ρ(l). The integral has to be per-<lb/>formed along the line of sight (l.o.s.). As pointed <lb/>out in [8], apart from the τ ¯ <lb/> τ channel, the photon <lb/>yields are quite similar. So fixing the halo density <lb/>profile (for example a NFW profile), a dominant <lb/>annihilation channel (that is b ¯ b, t ¯ <lb/> t, W <lb/> +  W <lb/> −  , ...) <lb/>and the corresponding yield, it is possible to per-<lb/>form a scan in the plane (m  wimp  , σv) in order to <lb/>determine the GLAST reach and the regions that <lb/>are already excluded by the EGRET data in the 2 <lb/>degrees region around the galactic center [8], [10], <lb/>i.e. the flux predicted by the susy+background <lb/>model must not exceed the total flux predicted <lb/>from EGRET data. The result of the scan is given <lb/>in figure 2. For every couple of values (m  wimp  , <lb/> σv) we compute the expected flux (1) and we per-<lb/>formed a standard χ <lb/> 2  statistical analysis to see if <lb/>GLAST is able to disentangle the WIMP contri-<lb/>bution among the standard astrophysical π <lb/> 0  back-<lb/>ground as used in [8] . The result is given at a <lb/> 3σ confidence level. The background uncertanties <lb/>are reflected in the red regions. We assumed a to-<lb/>tal exposure of 3.7 × 10 <lb/> 10  cm <lb/> 2  s, for a period of <lb/>4 years of data taking and an angular resolution (at <lb/> 10 GeV) of ∼ 3 × 10 <lb/> −5  sr as it can be derived from <lb/>the GLAST LAT performance [11]. <lb/> Point Sources of Dark Matter Annihilation <lb/> There is the possibility that the annihilation sig-<lb/>nal originates from large Dark Matter overdensi-<lb/>ties around Intermediate Mass Black Holes. In <lb/>Fig. 3 we show some illustrative examples of sim-<lb/>ulated sources.
