			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The study of phase transition [1,2] from a confined system of quarks in hadrons to a deconfined state <lb/>has become an interesting topic in the last two decades. During the early stages of the formation <lb/>of the universe, it is expected that matter was present as deconfined quarks and gluons, and in due <lb/>course, cooling led to the formation of hadrons. The process of this early stage of the universe can <lb/>be replicated as a complicated phenomenon in heavy-ion collider experiments. So, the study of the <lb/>quark–gluon plasma (QGP) fireball in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has become an exciting <lb/>field in current heavy-ion collider physics [3–5]. In this brief paper, we focus on QGP evolution <lb/>through the free energy expansion of the system. To evaluate the free energy, we use the mean-field <lb/>potential with one-loop correction factor to construct the density of states of particles in the system. <lb/>Thus the free energy evolution is obtained through this density of state. Due to the correction factor <lb/>in the potential through the coupling value [6–10], there are changes in the free energy expansion of <lb/>the QGP fireball, and it also impacts the stability of droplets with the variation of dynamical quark <lb/>and gluon flow parameters. <lb/>In brief, we construct the density of states with one-loop correction factor in the potential and <lb/>study the free energy evolution affected by the loop correction. In conclusion, we give details of the <lb/>evolution of the QGP fireball with different flow parametrization values. Preliminary results in this <lb/>paper were reported earlier in Ref. [11] <lb/> 2. Density of states for QGP with one-loop correction <lb/> The interacting mean-field potential V  conf  (q) is now modified with the inclusion of a one-loop cor-<lb/>rection factor from the simple confining potential, which is obtained through the Hamiltonian of <lb/>the system. The modified potential is therefore obtained through the expansion of strong coupling <lb/></body>

It is because the pions are assumed to be <lb/>the dominant component of the hadronized phase which involves explicit chiral symmetry-breaking <lb/>induced pion mass, but the total free energy only changes negligibly due to the introduction of pion <lb/>mass. We can thus compute the total modified free energy F  total  as, <lb/> F  total  = <lb/> i <lb/> F i  + F  interface  + F  π , <lb/> (11) <lb/>where i stands for u, d, s quarks and gluon. <lb/> 4.

So only the total free energy curves that make a crossover <lb/>represent a QGP transition. Moreover, it is indicated by lattice QCD that formation of QGP droplets <lb/>takes place under the condition of rollover phase rather than a sharp jump as temperature varies [28]. <lb/>Here, in this model of one-loop correction it shows a weakly first-order phase to the ambiguity of <lb/>crossover phase transition at low temperature. Besides, the parameters used in the work result in <lb/>an increase in the interaction between the constituent particles and affect the formation of stable <lb/>droplets, decreasing the amplitude of the free energy. <lb/>In Figs. 4 to 6 the various stable droplet formation for parameters ranging from 8γ  q  ≤ γ  g  ≤ 10γ  q <lb/> are shown. In these figures we can easily observe the stability of droplet formation with the flow <lb/>parameters of γ  q  = 1/8 and 8γ  q  ≤ γ  g  ≤ 10γ  q  . The stability is obtained with the different size of <lb/>droplet and the stable droplets are found in the range of radius 2.5–4.5 fm, which is around half the <lb/>droplet size without one-loop correction and its size decreases as the value of the gluon parameter <lb/>increases. This is obtained with the decrease in the quark and gluon flow parameters. <lb/> 5. Conclusion <lb/> We can conclude from these results that due to the presence of loop correction in the mean-field <lb/>potential, the stability of droplets increases while their size decreases in comparison with the result <lb/>with uncorrected potential. So, we can further study the velocity of sound and thermodynamic prop-<lb/>erties of QGP on the basis of these smaller droplets. In our further work, we plan to compare the <lb/>results with available data on fireball radius and possible experimental tests. <lb/></body>
