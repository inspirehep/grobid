			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The existence of hadronic form factor (HFF) in the hadronic vertex of an elementary <lb/>process is inevitable, since hadron is not a point-like particle. In general, this form <lb/>factor might be considered as a representation of matter distribution inside the <lb/>hadron and, as a consequence, a careful and detailed investigation of hadronic <lb/>processes should always take the HFF into account. <lb/>In a previous study, we have phenomenologically investigated the kaon photopro-<lb/>duction process γp → K <lb/> +  Λ by using global HFF in all hadronic vertices. <lb/> 1  A global <lb/>form factor was assumed for the sake of simplicity, because with just a few number <lb/>of different form factor types the number of possible combinations of utilizing them <lb/>in the model could be enormous. For instance, in the previous investigation we had <lb/>14 different hadronic vertices in the model. With five different types of form factors, <lb/></body>

			<body> the total possible combinations become 5 <lb/> 14  = 6, 103, 515, 625. Performing fits for <lb/>such a large number of combinations is obviously a daunting task. Furthermore, in <lb/>view of the accuracy of current experimental data as well as the effort devoted to this <lb/>task, performing this massive number of fits could be meaningless. To circumvent <lb/>this problem, we need a certain fitting strategy. It is the purpose of this paper to <lb/>explain this strategy and explore the result. Moreover, after obtaining the best form <lb/>factor combination, we can further investigate some related but important aspects, <lb/>e.g., the internal consistency of the data and the calculated differential cross-section <lb/>at forward angles. The latter becomes very important nowadays, because it is very <lb/>decisive for the prediction of the hypernuclear production cross-section. <lb/>There has been an ample number of investigations of kaon photoproduction in <lb/>the literature. Most of the recent investigations <lb/> 2–17  have been devoted to search <lb/>for missing resonances, i.e., the resonances predicted by some quark models but <lb/>not yet listed by the Particle Data Group (PDG). <lb/> 18  This is understandable, since <lb/>a solid knowledge of the nucleon spectra could provide important information on <lb/>the structure of the nucleon. On the other hand, this process has been also used <lb/>to study other phenomenological topics, e.g., the Regge phenomenon, <lb/> 19  threshold <lb/>behavior of the process, <lb/> 20  application of the chiral perturbation theory, <lb/> 21,22  as well <lb/>as production of kaon on a deuteron <lb/> 23–26  or heavier nuclei. <lb/> 27  Nevertheless, the <lb/>existence of HFFs in this process still receives less attention (see, e.g., Ref. 28 for a <lb/>short review), in spite of the fact that the involved particles are hadrons. <lb/>Besides the strong support from theoretical perspective, there is an obvious <lb/>advantage of using HFFs in phenomenological models. It is well-known that the <lb/>Born amplitude contains the energy-dependent terms which will violently increase <lb/>as the energy increases. Consequently, the cross-section calculated from such a <lb/> &quot; bare &quot; amplitude will overshoot the experimental data. Thus, the inclusion of HFF <lb/>in this case provides an effective suppression of the amplitude in the higher energy <lb/>regime. Note, however, that a direct inclusion of the form factor will destroy the <lb/>gauge invariance of the Born terms, since in this case, not all terms are individually <lb/>gauge invariant. In the literature, we can find a number of recipes that has been put <lb/>forward to fix this problem. <lb/> 29,30  Finally, we also note that there has been criticism of <lb/>the use of HFF in meson photoproduction, since its role to suppress the divergent <lb/>amplitude could be replaced by including two selected hyperon resonances, i.e., <lb/>the Λ(1800)S  01  and Λ(1810)P  01  . <lb/> 31  Our recent study with more experimental data <lb/>included, however, indicates that a better result would be obtained by using the <lb/>HFFs and including the Λ(1600)P  01  and Λ(1810)P  01  hyperon resonances. <lb/> 32 <lb/> The preliminary result of the findings described in the present paper has been <lb/>reported in a conference proceedings. <lb/> 33  The organization of this paper is as follows: <lb/>In Sec. 2, we briefly present the elementary model used in this study. Section 3 <lb/>summarizes the types of HFFs used in the present study. In Sec. 4, we discuss the <lb/>methods for restoring gauge invariance after the inclusion of HFFs. The results <lb/>of our investigation will be given in Sec. 5. We will summarize and conclude our <lb/>findings in Sec. 6. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2. The Elementary Model <lb/> In the present study, we use the same covariant isobar model as in our previous <lb/>studies. <lb/> 1,34  The model is constructed from the most suitable Feynman diagrams <lb/>that describe the background and resonance terms. The background terms con-<lb/>sist of the standard s-, t- and u-Born channels along with two vector mesons with <lb/>different parities, i.e., the K <lb/>  *  (892) and K  1  (1270), that have been shown to effec-<lb/>tively suppress the diverging Born terms. Furthermore, two hyperon resonances, <lb/>i.e., Λ(1600)P  01  and Λ(1810)P  01  , are included in order to increase the HFF cutoffs <lb/>discussed in detail in Ref. 32. <lb/>The resonance part consists of the nucleon resonances taken from PDG, <lb/> 18  which <lb/>have masses between the K <lb/> +  Λ threshold energy (1.609 GeV) and the energy upper <lb/>limit of the data, i.e., 2.2 GeV. The model does not include the nucleon resonances <lb/>with masses below the threshold energy, because their couplings were found to <lb/>be small. <lb/> 35  To avoid more uncertainties in the model, as well as to simplify the <lb/>formalism the resonance spin is limited only up to 3/2. In addition, the model <lb/>also uses the P  11  (1840) state, which was found in Ref. 36 to significantly, con-<lb/>tribute to the photoproduction of K <lb/> +  Λ, K <lb/> +  Σ <lb/> 0  and K <lb/> 0  Σ <lb/> +  . In our recent study <lb/> 34 <lb/> we have also obtained the same findings. Thus, in the nucleon resonance terms <lb/>we use the N <lb/>  *  (1650)S  11  , N <lb/>  *  (1700)D  13  , N <lb/>  *  (1710)P  11  , N <lb/>  *  (1720)P  13  , N <lb/>  *  (1840)P  11  , <lb/> N <lb/>  *  (1900)P  13  , N <lb/>  *  (2080)D  13  , N <lb/>  *  (2090)S  11  and N <lb/>  *  (2100)P  11  states. Since hadron is <lb/>not point-like, as discussed in Sec. 1, we include HFFs in the hadronic vertices and <lb/>make use of the method explained in Ref. 30 to restore the gauge invariance. A brief <lb/>discussion of this topic is given in Sec. 4. For a detailed explanation of this model <lb/>we refer the reader to Ref. 34. Note that the model is able to nicely reproduce all <lb/>available experimental data for the K <lb/> +  Λ photoproduction, which consists of more <lb/>than 3500 data points, with χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N = 2.57 in the original model <lb/> 34  and χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N = 2.30 <lb/>in the modified one. <lb/> 1 <lb/> 3. Hadronic Form Factors <lb/> In the previous study, <lb/> 1  we have explained in detail the types of HFFs found in the <lb/>literature. To visualize the ability of the form factors in suppressing the amplitude, <lb/>we have also plotted their values as functions of the four-momentum squared and <lb/>their cutoffs. Here, we will just briefly explain the five types of form factors used in <lb/>the present study. Further explanation can be found in Ref. 1. <lb/>The first HFF used in this analysis is the dipole form, which reads <lb/> F (q <lb/> 2  ) = <lb/>Λ <lb/> 4 <lb/> Λ  4  + (q  2  − m  2  )  2  . <lb/> (1) <lb/>To our knowledge, this form factor is the most frequently used form factor in the <lb/>investigation of meson production. In Eq. (1), Λ indicates the form factor cutoff, <lb/>while q <lb/> 2  denotes the four-momentum squared of the off-shell particle whose mass <lb/>is m. This form factor does not have any singularity even at the pole position, i.e., <lb/></body>

			<body> q <lb/> 2  = m <lb/> 2  . For the sake of clarity the dipole form factor is sometimes written as <lb/> F (q <lb/> 2  ) = <lb/> 1 + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> − m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Λ  2 <lb/>  2   −1 <lb/> , <lb/> (2) <lb/>which shows that the form factor is free of poles for a finite values of Λ. <lb/>The Gaussian form factor is also frequently used in the investigation of meson <lb/>production since it is free of singularity too. The most commonly used form in this <lb/>case reads <lb/> F (q <lb/> 2  ) = exp <lb/> − <lb/> (q <lb/> 2 <lb/> − m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> Λ  4 <lb/> . <lb/> (3) <lb/>As shown in our previous study, <lb/> 1  this form factor can suppress the amplitude much <lb/>faster than the monopole or dipole one. <lb/>The last form factor used in the present study is the generalized dipole form <lb/>factor proposed more than three decades ago. <lb/> 37  We have also investigated the effect <lb/>of this form factor in our previous study. The form factor can be written as <lb/> F (x) = <lb/>1 <lb/>1 + a  1  |x| + · · · + a  r  |x|  r  , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where x is the four-momentum squared of the off-shell particle, written as q <lb/> 2  in <lb/>Eq. (1). As in the previous study, we rewrite this form factor as <lb/> F (q <lb/> 2  ) = <lb/> 1 + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> − m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Λ  2 <lb/> + · · · + <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> − m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Λ  2 <lb/> r   −1 <lb/> . <lb/> (5) <lb/>Note that in the present analysis the number of terms r in Eq. (5) is limited up to <lb/>three. Therefore, in total we have five different types of form factors. Depending on <lb/>the terms, the four-momentum squared of the off-shell particle q <lb/> 2  will be replaced <lb/>by the Mandelstam variables s, t, or u. <lb/> 4. Restoring the Gauge Invariance <lb/> There has been a number of methods proposed in the literature to restore the gauge <lb/>invariance after including the HFFs. <lb/> 29,30,38,39  For the sake of clarity, we will briefly <lb/>discuss the application of these methods in kaon photoproduction. Our discussion <lb/>in this section is primarily based on Refs. 1 and 30. <lb/>Figure 1 exhibits the s- and t-channel Feynman diagrams that contribute to the <lb/>background terms of kaon photoproduction with the kinematics convention γ(p) + <lb/> p(k) → K <lb/> +  (q) + Λ(p  Λ  ). It is well-known that both diagrams are not individually <lb/>gauge invariant and in the case of point particles (no HFFs) only by adding the <lb/>two contributions we will get the gauge invariant amplitude, i.e., <lb/>  µ  J <lb/> µ  = <lb/>4iegγ  5 <lb/> (s − m  2 <lb/> p  )(t − m  2 <lb/> K  ) <lb/>¯ <lb/> u  Λ  {p · kq ·  − p · q · k}u  p  , <lb/> (6) <lb/>where g = g  KΛN  is the leading coupling constant (CC) and we have used the pseu-<lb/>doscalar coupling. Note that the gauge invariance implies that the amplitude will <lb/></body>

With the <lb/>definition of Mandelstam variables s = (k + p) <lb/> 2  and t = (k − q) <lb/> 2  , as well as F  t  ≡ F (t) <lb/>and F  s  ≡ F (s) for the sake of brevity, the amplitude now reads <lb/>  µ  J <lb/> µ  = <lb/>4iegγ  5 <lb/> (s − m  2 <lb/> p  )(t − m  2 <lb/> K  ) <lb/>¯ <lb/> u  Λ  {p · kq · F  t  − p · q · kF  s  }u  p  , <lb/> (7) <lb/>which is obviously no longer gauge invariant, since F  t  = F  s  . For the purpose of our <lb/>present discussion we can recast Eq. (7) to <lb/>  µ  J <lb/> µ  = <lb/>4iegγ  5 <lb/> (s − m  2 <lb/> p  )(t − m  2 <lb/> K  ) <lb/>¯ <lb/> u  Λ  [(p · kq ·  − p · q · k) ˆ <lb/> F <lb/> − {p · kq · ( ˆ <lb/> F − F  t  ) − p · q · k( ˆ <lb/> F − F  s  )}]u  p  , <lb/> ≡  µ  J <lb/> µ <lb/> g.i.  +  µ  J <lb/> µ <lb/> non-g.i.  , <lb/> (8) <lb/>where g.i. stands for gauge invariant and in Eq. (8) we have introduced a new form <lb/>factor <lb/>  for the g.i. term. Note that the non-g.i. term vanishes in the case of point <lb/>particles, since by definition in this casê <lb/> F = F  s  = F  t  = 1. <lb/>To restore the gauge invariance one can introduce an additional contact term <lb/>shown in Fig. 1(c). To this end, all methods proposed in the literature introduce <lb/>basically an additional contact current, represented by the contact term in Fig. 1(c), <lb/>which cancels exactly the non-g.i. term given in Eq. (8), i.e., <lb/>  µ  J <lb/> µ <lb/> c  = −  µ  J <lb/> µ <lb/> non-g.i.  . <lb/> (9) <lb/>In the method proposed by Ohta, <lb/> 39  it is found that <lb/>  = 1, whereas in the method <lb/>proposed by Haberzettl, <lb/> 38  it is obtained that <lb/>  could be a function of Mandelstam <lb/>variables s, u and t. Since this choice will directly affect the g.i. term and, more-<lb/>over, considering more flexibilities in fitting the parameters provided by the latter <lb/>method, in the present analysis we use the method proposed by Haberzettl, <lb/> 30,38 <lb/></body>

Results and Discussion <lb/>5.1. Variation of the HFF cutoff <lb/> As discussed in Sec. 1, the number of possible combinations of HFFs used in each <lb/>hadronic vertex is enormous. Our strategy to overcome this problem is summarized <lb/>in the following steps. <lb/>5.1.1. Step 1. Global type of form factor <lb/> In general, we divide the hadronic vertices in the model into four groups, i.e., (i) <lb/>Born terms, (ii) K <lb/>  *  terms, (iii) Y <lb/>  *  terms and (iv) N <lb/>  *  terms. As a first step, we use <lb/>the same type of form factor for all terms in the model. Since we have five form <lb/>factors, there are five possible fit combinations. Note that we refit the same data <lb/>as in the original model. <lb/> 34  The result is given in Table 1. Obviously, the use of the <lb/>dipole form factor is recommended by this step. <lb/>5.1.2. Step 2. Variation of the group form factor <lb/> Having obtained the dipole form factor as the best global form factor, we start <lb/>with the variation of the form factors in the hadronic vertices of the four groups <lb/>mentioned above. Since we have five types of form factors and four groups of con-<lb/>tributing terms, the total combinations are 17×5 = 85. We refit the model for all 85 <lb/>combinations and found the values of χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N in the range between 2.47 and 3.44. For <lb/> Table 1.

			<body> Table 2. Values of χ  2  /N obtained by varying the type <lb/>of HFFs used in the four contributing terms to the K  +  Λ <lb/>photoproduction model. In this table the type of form <lb/>factors is abbreviated as: Dipole (Dip), Gaussian (Gau), <lb/>Generalized dipole 1 (GD1), Generalized dipole 2 (GD2) <lb/>and Generalized dipole 3 (GD3). Note that there are 85 <lb/>possible combinations. Only six combinations are shown <lb/>here. <lb/>Born <lb/>Nucleon <lb/>Meson <lb/>Hyperon <lb/> χ  2  /N <lb/> GD1 <lb/>Gau <lb/>Gau <lb/>Gau <lb/>3.44 <lb/>GD1 <lb/>Dip <lb/>Dip <lb/>Dip <lb/>3.43 <lb/>Gau <lb/>Gau <lb/>GD2 <lb/>Gau <lb/>3.36 <lb/> · · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/>· · · <lb/> Dip <lb/>Dip <lb/>GD3 <lb/>Dip <lb/>2.49 <lb/>Dip <lb/>Dip <lb/>Gau <lb/>Dip <lb/>2.48 <lb/>Dip <lb/>Gau <lb/>Gau <lb/>Gau <lb/>2.47 <lb/> the sake of simplicity, in Table 2, we only list the results from six form factor com-<lb/>binations which represent the three highest and three lowest χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N values obtained <lb/>in the fit process. Other possible combinations clearly yield the χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N within these <lb/>values. <lb/>From the two last combinations shown in Table 2, we may conclude that the <lb/>best result would be obtained by using the dipole form factor in the Born terms and <lb/>the Gaussian one in the K <lb/>  *  terms. Note that the lowest χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N would be obtained <lb/>by using Gaussian form factor also in the nucleon and hyperon resonance terms. <lb/>However, the use of dipole form in the nucleon and hyperon resonances is still <lb/>acceptable, since the χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N obtained in this case differs only by 0.01. In most possible <lb/>combinations, we obtain that the dipole form factor is better used, except for the <lb/> K <lb/>  *  terms. This result is consistent with the result obtained in the first step. <lb/>To further check the consistency of the result given in Table 2, we refit the model <lb/>by keeping the Gaussian form factor for the K <lb/>  *  terms and vary the form factors in <lb/>the other three groups. Again, we obtain a consistent result as given in Table 2. <lb/>5.1.3. Step 3. Variation of all form factors inside the group <lb/> Finally, we vary the type of form factors of the individual resonances inside the <lb/>groups. For instance, we vary the form factors of the individual nucleon resonances, <lb/>whereas the form factors for the Born, hyperon and kaon resonances are kept fixed. <lb/>Fitting with more than 100 form factor combinations have been performed for this <lb/>purpose. The best result is obtained with χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N = 2.13 and the corresponding form <lb/>factor for each term is given in Table 3. Note that for consistency we keep here <lb/>the notation of the original model, which conforms the notation of the previous <lb/>version of PDG listing, <lb/> 40  e.g., the N (2080)D  13  which has been replaced by the <lb/> N (1875)D  13  in the new PDG listing. <lb/> 18  Nonetheless, in the best model the mass <lb/></body>

			<body> large. This can be seen from the K <lb/>  *  form factor cutoff shown in Table 3, which is <lb/>relatively soft and, as a consequence, strongly suppresses the K <lb/>  *  contribution. <lb/>From Table 3, it appears that different diagrams require different types of HFFs. <lb/>Physically, this is because as functions of energy and kaon angle contribution of each <lb/>diagram is unique. Furthermore, at higher energies certain diagrams yield a large <lb/>contribution, whereas others do not. As a consequence, in order to reproduce the <lb/>experimental data the form factors required to adjust these contributions should <lb/>behave differently. This is the reason behind the need for different types of HFFs <lb/>as listed in Table 3. <lb/>The different values of hadronic cutoff for different intermediate states, as shown <lb/>in Table 3, correspond directly to different required suppression. From our experi-<lb/>ence, <lb/> 41,42  since the Born terms increase significantly as the energy increases, they <lb/>need a strong suppression, i.e., a small cutoff. This is obvious from Table 3. The left <lb/>panel of Fig. 2 elucidates this situation. For the other background terms, i.e., the <lb/> t-channel resonances K <lb/>  *  (892) and K  1  (1270), as well as the u-channel resonances <lb/>Λ(1600)P  01  and Λ(1810)P  01  , the situation is rather complicated. <lb/> a  In principle, their <lb/>contributions should also be significantly limited in order to produce a reasonable <lb/>cross-section at higher energies. However, the required suppression is also deter-<lb/>mined by the angular distributions of cross-section and other polarization observ-<lb/>ables, which is obvious from the right panel of Fig. 2. Therefore, the combination <lb/>of a relatively large CC and a strong cutoff (small Λ), or vice versa, seems to be the <lb/>most appropriate one, as shown by the CCs and hadronic cutoffs of both K <lb/>  *  (892) <lb/>and K  1  (1270) in Table 3. This is also valid for the u-channel resonances Λ(1600)P  01 <lb/> and Λ(1810)P  01  , although their role is different from the role of the t-channel res-<lb/>onances.

			<body>  In contrast to the Born terms, the contribution of resonance terms typically <lb/>does not dramatically increase at higher energies. We note that in the covariant <lb/>formalism used in the present analysis the resonance terms also generate additional <lb/>backgrounds. Nevertheless, they differ from the Born terms, i.e., the corresponding <lb/>background amplitude does not violently increase as in the case of Born terms. Thus, <lb/>the resonance terms usually do not require a strong suppression. The N (2090)S  11 <lb/> would presumably be a special case. The small CC and soft form factor in this case <lb/>can be interpreted as an indication that the N (2090)S  11  plays a less important role <lb/>in the K <lb/> +  Λ photoproduction. <lb/>Note that the use of HFFs is not the only mechanism to suppress the divergence <lb/>of the amplitude. In Ref. 43, it is shown that one can also utilize the coupled <lb/>channel effect for this purpose. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the partial <lb/>waves calculation in Ref. 43 makes use of 20 nucleon resonances in order to achieve <lb/>a good agreement with the experimental data. The number of used resonances is <lb/>therefore twice larger than that used in the present study. Obviously, the number of <lb/>free parameters in Ref. 43 is also larger.

			<body> low energies. For W ≥ 1700 MeV, the discrepancy between model calculation and <lb/>experimental data starts to become significant, especially in the forward kinematics <lb/>(see Fig. 37 of Ref. 43). <lb/>To check and visualize the result of our calculation, in Fig. 3 we compare the dif-<lb/>ferential cross-sections obtained from the best model (Table 3) with those obtained <lb/>by using the global dipole, Gaussian and generalized dipole form factors, along with <lb/>the corresponding experimental data. From Fig. 3, it is clear that the best model <lb/>can nicely reproduce the experimental data and indeed much better than other <lb/>models. In the case that experimental data indicate an internal inconsistency, the <lb/>best model produces a more democratic result (average values) or approaches the <lb/>data with smaller error bars. Note that experimental data near the threshold energy <lb/>are more scattered and, as a consequence, indicate more inconsistency than those at <lb/>higher energies. In this kinematics the latest CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrom-<lb/>eter (CLAS) data <lb/> 44  tend to be higher than the previous one, <lb/> 45  whereas the former <lb/>have larger error bars near the threshold. Such situation would certainly increase <lb/>the complexity of phenomenological studies at threshold, as has been pointed out <lb/>in Refs. 46 and 47. <lb/>The same trend is also exhibited in the case of recoil polarization, target asym-<lb/>metry and photon asymmetry, as shown in Fig. 4.

			<body> other calculations exhibit the same phenomenon. This is understandable, because <lb/>the model does not include nucleon resonances with m ≈ 2.2 GeV. In the case of <lb/>target and photon asymmetries, we can see that the best model can describe exper-<lb/>imental data much better than other calculations. Future experiments at Super <lb/>Photon Ring-8 Gev (SPring-8) or Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility <lb/>(CEBAF) would be able to put more constraints on the model by measuring the <lb/>asymmetries at higher energies, where the discrepancy between models becomes <lb/>more evident. <lb/>Finally, in the case of double polarization observables O  x   , O  z   , C  x  and C  z  , <lb/>shown in Fig. 5, the best model displays its superiority. Especially in the case of <lb/> C  x  and C  z  , where experimental data at high energies are available, the best model <lb/>can reproduce the data within their error bars. <lb/> 5.2.

			<body> theoretical prediction of the hypernucleus production cross-section depends sensi-<lb/>tively on the elementary amplitude at this kinematics. <lb/> 41,58–62  Therefore, a better <lb/>determination of the elementary amplitude at this kinematics becomes an impor-<lb/>tant agenda of theoretical and experimental investigations at present and in the <lb/>future. <lb/>We observe that the currently available experimental data do not reach the <lb/>forward kinematics.

			<body> form factor (see Fig. 8 of Ref. 1). Since the best model obtained in the present <lb/>analysis has a specific HFF combination as shown in Table 3, we may vary their <lb/>cutoffs as well as the related CCs in order to investigate the sensitivity of the <lb/>differential cross-section at forward kaon angles. We found that in most cases the <lb/>cross-section is insensitive to these variations. Only in the case of K <lb/>  *  intermediate <lb/>state we found sizable effect, though relatively small at θ  K  ≈ 0. This is shown <lb/>in Fig. 7, where we compare the differential cross-section obtained by different <lb/> K <lb/>  *  cutoffs (±10% from its original value) and CCs (±20% from their original <lb/>values) with experimental data. Only at larger angles ( 30 <lb/> •  ) the effect becomes <lb/>significantly large. Therefore, we may conclude that the choice of HFF determines <lb/>the cross-section behavior at threshold, whereas variation of the hadronic cutoffs <lb/>and CCs influence this behavior slightly. <lb/> 6. Summary and Conclusion <lb/> We have investigated the kaon photoproduction process γp → K <lb/> +  Λ by searching <lb/>for the best form factor combination that yields the smallest χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N . Instead of per-<lb/>forming more than 6 × 10 <lb/> 9  fit combinations, we have proposed a simple fit strategy <lb/>to find the best model with the smallest χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N . This was performed by grouping <lb/>the terms according to their properties during the fit process. The best model was <lb/>obtained by using the dipole form factor for the Born, N (1650)S  11  , N (1700)D  13  , <lb/> N (1900)P  13  , N (2080)D  13  , N (2090)S  11  and N (2100)P  11  terms, whereas for the <lb/> K <lb/>  *  (892), N (1710)P  11  , N (1720)P  13  , N (1840)P  11  and the two hyperon resonances <lb/>Λ(1600)P  01  and Λ(1810)P  01  , the model utilizes the Gaussian form. Only for the <lb/> K  1  (1270) exchange, the model requires the generalized dipole form factor with <lb/> r = 1. With χ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /N = 2.13, the model can nicely reproduce the available exper-<lb/>imental data with different types of observables. From the model point of view, <lb/>the experimental data used are found to be internally consistent, since the aver-<lb/>age of their deviations is relatively small. We have also found that variation of the <lb/>form factor cutoff and hadronic CCs only slightly changes the magnitude of the <lb/>differential cross-section at forward angles. <lb/></body>
