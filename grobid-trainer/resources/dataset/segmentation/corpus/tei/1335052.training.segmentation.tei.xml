			<body> 1. The Quantum Coded Universe <lb/> This paper addresses quantum gravity as quantum encryption system. The microstates <lb/>of a black hole are modeled by the integer partition function. The modular structure, or <lb/>more explicitly the Dedekind η-function, suggests the most general symmetry for quantum <lb/>cosmology and gravity is the Jordan matrix algebra. <lb/>The simulation of quantum black holes within this structure will lead to quantum <lb/>computing and encryption-communication technology of a general variety. A black hole <lb/>may be optically simulated, where entangled qubits may be integrated into a quantum <lb/>optical computer. The first step will be with the optical simulation of black holes with <lb/>4-partite entanglement configurations with 8 states. A triality condition, or O <lb/> ⊗3  , of three <lb/>sets of these will then be a simulation of a black hole which obeys the proper integer <lb/>partition of microstates. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2. Why Quantum Gravity? <lb/> Black holes are a theoretical laboratory for research into quantum gravity. Black holes are <lb/>simpler to model than cosmologies and the models are comparatively straight forwards. <lb/>They were also in the case of Hawking radiation the first general relativistic object to be <lb/>considered in a quantum mechanical setting. Further, it is more plausible to build up a <lb/>black hole from quantum states, or strings, than it is the entire universe. The black hole <lb/>is defined by a set of simple parameters, mass, angular momentum and charge, which are <lb/>macrostates that conceals a vast set of possible microstates. This fact was used to derive <lb/>early thermodynamics and quantum mechanical properties of black holes. <lb/>The quantum mechanics of black holes could have had a much earlier start. At the <lb/>1930 Solvay conferences Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein debated the nature of quantum <lb/>mechanics [1]. Einstein was convinced of reality and locality and argued staunchly for an <lb/>incompleteness of quantum mechanics. Quantum theory could only be made complete if <lb/>there are some hidden variables that underlay the probabilistic, nonlocal quirky aspects <lb/>of quantum mechanics. Einstein proposed an interesting thought experiment. Einstein <lb/>considered a device which consisted of a box with a door in one of its walls controlled <lb/>by a clock. The box contains radiation, similar to a high-Q cavity in laser optics. The <lb/>door opens for some brief period of time t, which is known to the experimenter. The <lb/>loss of one photon with energy E = ¯ <lb/> hω reduces the mass of the box-clock system by <lb/> m = E/c <lb/> 2  , which is on a scale. Einstein argued that knowledge of t and the change in <lb/>weight provides an arbitrarily accurate measurement of both energy and time which may <lb/>violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ΔEΔt  ¯ <lb/> h [1-2]. <lb/>Bohr realized that the weight of the device is made by the displacement of a scale in <lb/>spacetime. The clocks new position in the gravity field of the Earth, or any other mass, <lb/>will change the clock rate by gravitational time dilation as measured from some distant <lb/>point the experimenter is located. The temporal metric term for a spherical gravity field <lb/>is 1 − 2GM/rc <lb/> 2  , where a displacement by some δr means the change in the metric term <lb/>is  (GM/c <lb/> 2  r <lb/> 2  )δr. Hence the clocks time interval T is measured to change by a factor <lb/> T → T <lb/> (1 − 2GM δr/(rc)  2  )  T (1 − GM δr/r <lb/> 2  c <lb/> 2  ), <lb/>(1) <lb/>so the clock appears to tick slower. This changes the time span the clock keeps the door <lb/>on the box open to release a photon. Assume that the uncertainty in the momentum is <lb/>given by the Δp  ¯ <lb/> h/Δr &lt; TgΔm, where g = GM/r <lb/> 2  . Similarly the uncertainty <lb/>in time is found as ΔT = (T g/c <lb/> 2  )δr. From this ΔT &gt; ¯ <lb/> h/Δmc <lb/> 2  is obtained and the <lb/>Heisenberg uncertainty relation ΔT ΔE &gt; ¯ <lb/> h. This demands a Fourier transformation <lb/>between position and momentum, as well as time and energy. <lb/>This holds in some part to the quantum level with gravity, even if we do not fully <lb/>understand quantum gravity. Consider the clock in Einsteins box as a black hole with <lb/>mass m. The quantum periodicity of this black hole is given by some multiple of Planck <lb/>masses. For a black hole of integer number n of Planck masses the time it takes a photon <lb/>to travel across the event horizon is t ∼ Gm/c <lb/> 3  = nT  p  , which are considered as the <lb/></body>

			<body> time intervals of the clock. The uncertainty in time the door to the box remains open is <lb/>ΔT <lb/> T g <lb/>c(δr − GM/c  2  ) <lb/> , <lb/> (2) <lb/>as measured by a distant observer. Similarly the change in the energy is given by E  2  /E  1  = <lb/> 1 − 2M/r  1 <lb/> 1 − 2M/r  2 <lb/> i, which gives an energy uncertainty of <lb/>ΔE <lb/> ¯ <lb/> hg <lb/>T  1  c  2  (δr − GM/c  2  ) <lb/> . <lb/> (3) <lb/>Consequently the Heisenberg uncertainty principle still holds ΔEΔT  ¯ <lb/> h. Thus general <lb/>relativity beyond the Newtonian limit preserves the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. <lb/>It is interesting to note in the Newtonian limit this leads to a spread of frequencies <lb/>Δω <lb/> c  5  /G¯ h, which is the Planck frequency. <lb/>The uncertainty ΔE  ¯ <lb/> h/Δt larger than the Planck mass gives an event horizon. <lb/>The horizon has a radius R  2GΔE/c <lb/> 4  , which is the uncertainty in the radial position <lb/> R = Δr associated with the energy fluctuation. Putting this together with the Planckian <lb/>uncertainty in the Einstein box we then have <lb/>ΔrΔt <lb/> 2G¯ h <lb/>c  4  = <lb/> 2 <lb/> P lanck  /c. <lb/> (4) <lb/>So this argument can be pushed to understand the nature of noncommutative coordinates <lb/>in quantum gravity. <lb/>By this simple argument a new type of quantization appears. The parallel translation <lb/>of vectors in spacetime defines curvature, but where this can manifest itself in a quantized <lb/>form. This could have been realized far earlier than when quantum gravity started to <lb/>gain interest in the late 1960s. The uncertainty above defines a unit of area, such as a <lb/>quantal unit of area on a black hole. <lb/> 3. Black holes as Degenerate States and the Partition function <lb/> The entropy of a black hole is a measure of the number of microstates, where for N <lb/> degenerate microstates the entropy is S = k log(N ), which is associated with gravity <lb/>[3]. The entropy for large N is determined by the area of the event horizon S = kA/4L <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  , <lb/>where for the Schwarzschild black hole A = 16πM <lb/> 2  . The black hole is a system which <lb/>holds a set of states with energy E = M in a degeneracy g(E) = exp(4πE <lb/> 2  ) and the <lb/>partition function is [4] <lb/> Z(β) = <lb/> E <lb/> e <lb/> 4πE  2  e <lb/> −βE  . <lb/> (5) <lb/>This partition function is divergent for E → ∞. The statistics for the number of degen-<lb/>erate microstates for a black hole is unbounded, and thus the partition function diverges. <lb/>Black hole entropy is a coarse graining microstate states, which has been accomplished <lb/>in string theory for large N . The horizon area is a summation of these quantum numbers <lb/> A = 16πα <lb/> N <lb/> i=1 <lb/> n  i  , <lb/> (6) <lb/></body>

			<body> for α  p  a Planck area. The quantum numbers n  i  determine an element of the horizon area. <lb/>The energy is then counted as E  n  = αE  p <lb/> √ <lb/> n, for n = <lb/>  N <lb/>i=1  n  i  [4] <lb/>The degeneracy for E  n  is the number of ways n &gt; 0 is a sum of N or less positive <lb/>integers n  i  . It is the cardinality of the set of elements {n  1  , n  2  , , . . . , n  m  }, such that <lb/> n = <lb/>  m <lb/>i=1  n  i  for 1 ≤ m &lt; N. The number of ways a positive integer m may be <lb/>written as a sum of m positive integers is the same problem as computing the number of <lb/>ways of arranging n balls in m cells in a row. The result is a degeneracy for the energy <lb/> E  n <lb/> g(E  n  ) = <lb/> N <lb/> m = 1 <lb/> n − 1 <lb/> m − 1 <lb/> , <lb/> (7) <lb/>for N ≤ n. We also have that m ≤ n, which cuts the degeneracy further in <lb/> g <lb/>  (E  n  ) = <lb/> n <lb/> m = 1 <lb/> n − 1 <lb/> m − 1 <lb/> . <lb/> (8) <lb/>The partition function is a summation of the two degenerate sets, <lb/> Z(β) = <lb/> N <lb/> n=1 <lb/>n <lb/> m=1 <lb/> n − 1 <lb/> m − 1 <lb/> e <lb/> −Epα <lb/>√ <lb/> n  + <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=M +1 <lb/> N <lb/> m=1 <lb/> n − 1 <lb/> m − 1 <lb/> e <lb/> −Epα <lb/>√ <lb/> n  . <lb/> (9) <lb/>The two portions of the partition functions play a role at n small and n &gt;&gt; N, and <lb/>may be computed independently [4]. The convergence occurs for n &gt;&gt; N with <lb/> Z(β) <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n = N +1 <lb/> (n − 1) <lb/> N −1  e <lb/> −βEpα <lb/>√ <lb/> n  . <lb/> (10) <lb/>This is a convergent partition function. Conversely for a low black hole temperature <lb/> n &lt;&lt; N, the degeneracy from the binomial theorem is g <lb/>  (E  n  )  2 <lb/> n−1  and the black <lb/>hole entropy is S = k ln(2 <lb/> n−1  ) = (n − 1)ln2. The area A = 16πα <lb/> 2  n permits us to <lb/>set α = (1/2) <lb/> ln2/π. This gives the entropy of the black hole S = A/4. <lb/> The degeneracy is extended to consider the energy level as due to a spin with an <lb/>elementary energy E  j  = <lb/> j(j + 1). The spin is SU (2), which is a double covering <lb/>symmetry of the spherical gravity field for a Schwarzschild black hole, with j = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> . There <lb/>are two states { <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> , − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> } and for m spins there are 2 <lb/> m  possible spin configurations. Hence <lb/>the degeneracy for energy n is <lb/> g(E  n  ) = <lb/> N <lb/> m=1 <lb/> n − 1 <lb/> m − 1 <lb/> 2 <lb/> m  = 3 <lb/> n−1  . <lb/> (11) <lb/>The entropy of the black hole is now S = (n − 1)ln 3 and α = (1/2) <lb/> ln 3/π. This <lb/>is then in agreement with the result by Hod [5] that quasi-normal modes are <lb/> ω  n  = α <lb/> 2  = <lb/> ln 3 <lb/>4π <lb/>+ 2πi(n + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>) + . . . . <lb/> (12) <lb/>This is equivalent to a redefinition α <lb/> 2 <lb/> → α <lb/> 2  + ln(j(j + 1))/4π. In appropriate units the <lb/>normal modes for a black hole of mass M are <lb/> ω  n  = <lb/> ln 3 <lb/>8πM <lb/>+ <lb/> i <lb/> 4M <lb/>(n + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>) + . . . , <lb/> (13) <lb/></body>

			<body> so the partition function of the black hole is <lb/> Z[β] = <lb/> n <lb/> e <lb/> 4πωn  e <lb/> −βα <lb/> √ <lb/> n  . <lb/> (14) <lb/>The string states in 26 dimensional is described by the Virasoro algebra. The gener-<lb/>ating function T r(q <lb/> N  ) is the density of string states for q = e <lb/> 2πiz  and N = <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> n=1  α  −n  α  n <lb/> the string number operator. The trace T r(q <lb/> N  ) over 24 transverse string oscillations is <lb/> T r(q <lb/> N  ) = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=1 <lb/> T r(q <lb/> n  ) = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=1 <lb/> (1 − q <lb/> n  ) <lb/> −24  , <lb/> (15) <lb/>where <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> n=1  (1 − q <lb/> n  ) is the partition function[6]. q <lb/> n  counts the number of way to write <lb/> n = a  1  + 2a  2  + . . . ma  m  . . ., for a  i  a natural number. This partition function is related <lb/>to the Dedekind η-function <lb/>η = q <lb/> τ /2 <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=1 <lb/> (1 − q <lb/> nτ  ), <lb/>(16) <lb/>for T r(ρ <lb/> N  ) = q <lb/> 24τ  η <lb/> −24  . The generating function written as <lb/> T r(q <lb/> N  ) = f (q) = exp <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> n=1 <lb/> ln(1 − q <lb/> n  ) <lb/> = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=0 <lb/> p(n)q <lb/> n  , ) <lb/>(17) <lb/>which is the p(n) partition of the integers This function p(n) is approximated with the <lb/>Hardy-Ramanujan approximate formula for the partition of the integers. The quantum <lb/>statistics of states on a black hole are similarly computed, and such generating functions <lb/>should be modular. These may be Ramanujan mock Θ functions, as suggested by Dyson <lb/>[7]. <lb/>In both the case of black holes and the string generating function, the fundamental <lb/>issue involves the partitioning of states as partitions of integers. The last equation for <lb/> T r(q <lb/> N  ) contains the complex term e <lb/> 2πinz  , for nz = 4ω  n  − ln 3/4π. The remainder is <lb/>an approximation for the integer partition function <lb/> p(n)  3e <lb/> −βα <lb/>√ <lb/> n <lb/> (18) <lb/>By using the Hardy-Ramanujan approximation for the integer partition the result is <lb/> p(n) <lb/> 1 <lb/>4n <lb/> √ <lb/> 3 <lb/> e <lb/> 4π <lb/> √ <lb/> n  , <lb/> (19) <lb/>which is remarkably similar formula to that obtained for the black hole. <lb/>This suggests the solution to the partition function is a partitioning of the integers, <lb/>and the statistics are accounted for by an IPF. Recently a partition function has been <lb/>derived as the finite sum and an algebraic number. This partition function p(n) computes <lb/>the partitions of an integer n, which is the sequence of integers: <lb/>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, 56, 77, 101, 135, 176, 231, <lb/>297, 385, 490, 627, 792, 1002, . . . , p(100) = 190569292, . . . <lb/> (20) <lb/></body>

			<body> The general form for p(n) has been a major problem in number theory. The circle method <lb/>of Hardy and Ramanujan produced an asymptotic approximation function <lb/> p(n) <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> √ <lb/> 3n <lb/> e <lb/> π <lb/> √ <lb/> 2n/3  . <lb/> (21) <lb/>Bruinier, Folsom, Kent and Ono [8-9] derived a formula for p(n) as a finite sum of algebraic <lb/>numbers using the Dedekind η function η = q <lb/> 1/24   ∞ <lb/> n=1  (1 − q <lb/> n  ) and the Eisenstein <lb/>series <lb/> E  2  (z) = 1 − 24 <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=1 <lb/> d|n <lb/> dp <lb/> n  . <lb/> (22) <lb/>A merimorphic form F (z) with weight −2 by the discrete group Γ  0  (6) is defined according <lb/>to Eisenstein series <lb/> F (z) = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> E  2  (z) − 2E  2  (2z) − 3E  2  (3z) + 5E  2  (6z) <lb/>(η(z)η(2z)η(3z)η(6z))  2 <lb/> (23) <lb/>= q <lb/> −1 <lb/> − 10 − 29q − 104q <lb/> 3 <lb/> − 273q <lb/> 3 <lb/> − . . . , <lb/> which is eigenvalued on the upper half of the complex plane ΔE  k  (q) = k(k − 1)E  k  (q), <lb/>and is a Maass form. <lb/> P (z) = − <lb/>  1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>2πy <lb/> F (z) <lb/>(24) <lb/>with eigenvalue −2 with respect to the hyperbolic Laplacian Δ = − y <lb/> 2  (∂ <lb/> 2 <lb/> x  + ∂ <lb/> 2 <lb/> y  ). <lb/>The group Γ  0  (6) acts on these modular forms to construct a Γ  0  (6) equivalence classes <lb/> Q  n  . The anti-holomorphic form P (z) on this class at discrete point in the hyperbolic <lb/>half-plane are summed over in a trace formula <lb/> tr(n) = <lb/> Q∈Qn <lb/> P (z  Q  ) <lb/>(25) <lb/>where x  Q  ∈ Q(x, y). This then gives a formula for the integer partition p(n) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2n+1 <lb/> T r(n) <lb/> The integer partition function is constructed in the same manner partition functions <lb/>are derived in statistical mechanics. The trace formula for the string states is a form of <lb/>statistical mechanical device, and this mathematics gives a precise way in which these <lb/>states may be partitioned to form an over all Boltzmann-like distribution, or e <lb/> −iS  in a <lb/>path integral. <lb/> 4. Quantum Gravity as O <lb/> ⊗3 <lb/> The application of the partition of integers to quantum states of gravity means they have <lb/>representations as modular functions. The exceptional groups have Jacobi θ-function <lb/> representations. The largest of the exceptional groups is the E  8  group, which does not <lb/>have a complex representation, but subgroups do, such as E  6  × SU (3). Further, this may <lb/>be overcome by extending the heterotic group into the Jordan matrix algebra. <lb/>The Jordan algebra is a 3×3 matrix comprised of three scalars and O  i  , for i = 1, 2, 3. <lb/>The 16 supersymmetric partners are the two defined in two sets of spinor fields which <lb/></body>

The Λ  12  with <lb/>Eisenstein integers is a complex realization of the Leech lattice. The Barnes-Wall lattice <lb/>Λ  16  fixes a 16-dimesional lattice subspace in R <lb/> 24  of the Leech lattice. This is a complex <lb/>realization of the E  8  lattice, where the 240 roots of E  8  have an 18-fold representation <lb/>with Gaussian integers. <lb/>This is an introduction to SLOCC groups for the Jordan matrix algebra. It is likely <lb/>there exists a range of possible quotient space structures based on octonion triples in the <lb/>Jordan matrix algebra. This above is to illustrate the simplest one which conforms to <lb/>the integer partition, the Dedekind η-function and the Δ <lb/> 24  . This appears to be a wide <lb/>open field of investigation in mathematical physics. <lb/> 5.

			<body> is this is a Chern-Simons Lagrangian. The cubic Lagrangian or Chern-Simons term is <lb/>the ω  3  (Γ) which determines the renormalization group flow of the metric to the Einstein <lb/>field equation for the AdS spacetime. The exceptional group F  4  is the maximal group of <lb/>the 24-cell, which has a representation as B  4  , or as a set of 16 rectified tetrahedral cells <lb/>and one set of 8 octahedral cells. The other representation is according to D  4  , which are <lb/>three sets of 8 rectified tetrahedra. This representation is a homomorphism induced by <lb/>the quotient group F  4  /D  4  , or F  4  splits over D  4  ∼ SO(8). The Dynkin diagram for F  4  is <lb/> − − − − === o − − − o <lb/> and D  4  is <lb/> o <lb/>o <lb/> \ / <lb/>o <lb/> | <lb/> o <lb/> where the circle-dot represents short roots. The quotient group will then have to roots <lb/>remaining as o—o which is the S <lb/> 3  or SU (3) group. Let the roots of the D  4  be represented <lb/>by (x  1  , x  2  , x  3  , x  4  ), where x  4  is the central root at the hub. Under the action of SU (3) <lb/>with roots (y, z) is then <lb/>(x  1  , x  2  , x  3  , x  4  ) <lb/> y  = (x  2  , x  1  , x  3  , x  4  ), (x  1  , x  2  , x  3  , x  4  ) <lb/> z  = (x  1  , x  3  , x  2  , x  4  ) <lb/>(33) <lb/>where F  4  is then the split extension of D  3  by the S <lb/> 3  or F  4  = D  4  S <lb/> 3  . This is a tri-<lb/>ality condition of D  4  in F  4  , where there are three copies of SO(8) determined by the <lb/>automorphism of E  8  . <lb/>The Jordan matrix algebra with the scalar light cone condition is a 26 dimensional <lb/>Lorentzian spacetime, which in general has z = 1. Thus the degrees of freedom lost in <lb/>the breaking of the restricted Lorentz symmetry in few dimensions are preserved. They <lb/>are preserved in the more general cubic Lagrangian of the Jordan matrix algebra. The <lb/>degrees of freedom are preserved in the nonlinear σ-model and the high energy theory <lb/>at z = 3 plus the degrees of freedom lost in the breaking of the Lorentz symmetry are <lb/>embedded in the F  4  /B  4  model. The theory is then ultimately contained in the J <lb/> 3  (O) <lb/>group F  4  acts as an automorphism over. <lb/>The F  4  is a representation of the 24-cell according the Hurwitz quaternions. A recent <lb/>paper Waegell and Aravind [13] illustrates a proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem with <lb/>respect to the 24-cell. The Kochen-Specker theorem is smiilar to the Bell inequality <lb/>violation theorem that is a no-go result for hidden variable theories [14]. The 24-cell is a <lb/>mathematical structure that comes up in the context of systems of qubits. Asher Peres <lb/>[15] gave a proof, which based on the symmetry of the root system of the exceptional Lie <lb/>algebra F  4  . The proof employs 48 vectors in 4-space which are isomorphic to the vertices <lb/>of a 24-cell and its dual. These vectors are root vectors of F  4  , which under multiplication <lb/>by any set of scalars defines a set of lines in 4-space. We identify each of these vectors with <lb/>a quantum state |ψ  i  i = 1, . . . , 24, and a projection operator P  i  = |ψ  i  ψ  i  |. These <lb/></body>

This means one can compute 72 sets of mutually <lb/>orthogonal lines, where this is four-fold redundancy, and there are only 18 independent <lb/>lines, which correspond to entangled pairs of 9 lines. <lb/>Suppose there were some hidden variable which accounts for this system. This would <lb/>give an exact value to each of the 18 operators. The 9 must assume the value 1 in each of <lb/>the 9 sets of pairs, an odd number, However, there is an even number of 1 with the pairs, <lb/>and an underlying theory which determines the values of the 18 operators would require <lb/>an even number also be odd. This is an informal proof of the Kochen-Specker theory in <lb/>four dimensions. <lb/> F  4  is the isometry group of the projective plane over the octonions. The exceptional <lb/>group G  2  is the automorphism on O, or equivalently that F  4  × G  2  defines a centralizer <lb/>on E  8  . The quotient between the 52 dimensional F  4  and the 36 dimensional so(9) ∼ B  4 <lb/> defines the short exact sequence <lb/> F  4  /B  4  : 1 → spin(9) → F  52\16  → OP <lb/> 2 <lb/> − − &gt; 1, <lb/>(34) <lb/>where F  52\16  means F  4  restricted to 36 dimensions, which are the kernel of the map to <lb/>the 16 dimensional Moufang or Cayley plane OP <lb/> 2  . Geometrically the F  4  define the sym-<lb/>metry of the 24-cell according to Hurwitz quaternions. The B  4  defines a more restricted <lb/>symmetry on the 24-cell according to 16 tetrahedral cells and 8 octahedral cells. The 16 <lb/>tetrahedral cells are mapped to OP <lb/> 2  and the 8 octrahedral cells define so(8) ∈ J <lb/> 3  (O). <lb/>The D  4  representations is three sets of 8 tetrahedral cells and define the so(8)S <lb/> 3 <lb/> ∈ J <lb/> 3  (O). <lb/>On the algebraic level f  4  so(8) ⊕ V ⊕ θ  1  ⊕ θ  2  , which explicitly describes the trial-<lb/>ity condition the three octonions with the so(8). More generally according to octonions <lb/> f  4  ∼ so(O) ⊕ O <lb/> 3  , and f  4  diagonalizes the Jordan cubic matrix. The 36 sets of 4 mu-<lb/>tually orthogonal rays is contained in F  52\16  above. The short exact sequence defines the <lb/> f  4  ∼ so(9) ⊕ S <lb/> 9  in the short exact sequence above. This means the K-S theorem is a <lb/>consequence of qubit structure which has the Kostant-Sekiguchi isomorphism with black <lb/>holes. <lb/>The 24-cell has the largest group representation F  4  in 52 dimensions, of which the <lb/> SO(9) in 36 dimension defines a short exact sequence between spin(9) and the Moufang <lb/>plane OP <lb/> 2  . The B  4  ∼ SO(9) symmetry of the 24-cell by 16 tetrahedral and 8 octahedral <lb/>cells. The elements of the exceptional Jordan matrix is composed of elements V  ab  which <lb/>are accompanies by 16 superpartners θ  ab  , ¯ <lb/> θ  ab  , where the indices a and b indicate internal <lb/>elements which transform these elements to N × N matrices in SU(N ). This obtains for <lb/>a single D-brane, in particular here a D0-brane, where for N &gt; 1 this gauge group is <lb/> SU(8) <lb/> N  , or the embedding group SU (8N ). The Lagrangian assumes the form [16] <lb/> L = (1/2)(tr(∂  μ  V  i  ) <lb/> 2  (1/2g)tr[V  i  , V  j  ] <lb/> 2 <lb/> − ¯ <lb/> θ  i  γ  j  [θ <lb/> i  , V <lb/> j  ]), <lb/>(35) <lb/>where integer the indices i, j denote the matrix indices.. Here the superpartners to the <lb/>vectors V transform as spinors under the SO(9) transverse rotations, and the matrices <lb/> V  ab  , θ  ab  (vectors and spinors in J <lb/> 3  (O)) are components in a 10 dimensional super Yang-<lb/>Mills space. This Lagrangian is applied as the SO(9) theory in the BF SS matrix theory <lb/>[16]. <lb/></body>

			<body> The F  4  diagonalizes the Jordan algebra and is the automorphism of the Jordan prod-<lb/>uct [17]. The Freudenthal product system <lb/> A * B = A•B − AoB − (1/2)(AT r(B) + BT r(A)) + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> T r(A)T r(B) − T r(A•B) (36) <lb/>is preserved under F  4  , as well as the determinant <lb/> det(A) = (1/3)[T r(A  *  A)oA] <lb/> (37) <lb/>The determinant of the Jordan Matrix M is the cubic characteristic equation <lb/> det(M − λI) = − λ <lb/> 3  + (T r(M )λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> − σ(M ) + det(M )I = 0 <lb/>(38) <lb/>for σ(M ) = (1/2)(T r(M ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> − T r(M <lb/> 2  )) and with real eigenvalues λ. The matrix M as a <lb/>form O <lb/> 3  may be written as a 24 × 24 matrix. The projector matrices for F  4  P  i  = |ψ  i  ψ  i  | <lb/> or as v  i  v <lb/>  † <lb/> i  diagonalize M with <lb/> Mvv <lb/>  †  = λvv <lb/>  †  , vv <lb/>  †  M = λvv <lb/>  †  , <lb/> (39) <lb/>or Mvv <lb/>  †  + vv <lb/>  †  M = 2λvv <lb/>  †  . Multiplication on the right with v and v <lb/>  †  v = 1 gives <lb/> Mv + vv <lb/>  †  Mv = 2λv and under the trace T r(vv <lb/>  †  ) = 1 this gives Mv = λv. The <lb/>determinant of M − λI <lb/>det(M − λI) = (M − λI)o((M − λI)  *  (M − λI)), <lb/> (40) <lb/>for X  *  X = X <lb/> 2 <lb/> − (tr X)X + σ(X)I, defines (M − λI)  *  (M − λI) as the projector <lb/>matrix which diagonalizes the X = M − λI. Thus X  *  X = vv <lb/>  †  when normalized <lb/>is a projector in the Cayley plane. Given two projectors with different eigenvalues λ and <lb/> λ <lb/>  have the determinant <lb/> P  λ  • (M • P  λ   ) = (P  λ  • M ) • P  λ   , → λ <lb/>  P  λ  • P  λ   λ(P  λ  • P  λ   , <lb/> (41) <lb/>and for the two eigenvalues λ  = λ <lb/>  . If we consider the two projectors nonzero this means <lb/>they are orthogonal. If we assume three eigenvalues with T r(P  λ  ) = σ(M − λI) the <lb/>determinant formula above is derived. The matrix M = <lb/>  3 <lb/> i=1  λ  i  P  λ  i  , and composed of <lb/>projectors. <lb/>The Cayley plane is F  4  /B  4  , and the short exact sequence defines the projective octo-<lb/>nionic plane. The quotient defines the 36 dimensional space which contains two copies of <lb/>the 18 lines with eigenstates {0, 0, 0, 1}. This may be interpreted as a type of quantiza-<lb/>tion.

			<body> correction codes which conserve quantum information. The equivalency between quantum <lb/>entanglement groups and the moduli space for black holes is a form of qubit conservation, <lb/>for the semi-simple and nilpotent orbit configuration on the moduli space are Noetherian <lb/>conservation laws. A complete partition function for black hole microstates extends this <lb/>system to the exceptional group J <lb/> 3  (O). <lb/>This quantum error correction code model of quantum gravity means that quantum <lb/>information in the entire universe is conserved. This should then be applied to the <lb/>universe as a whole. Spacetime cosmologies should be organized similarly with a corre-<lb/>spondence between entangled quantum states and the symmetries of the cosmology. The <lb/>cosmological horizon in a deSitter spacetime defines the entropy of the spacetime, and <lb/>this may be defined by determinants or hyperdeterminants that correspond to entangled <lb/>states. These states may be entangled with the bulk or with other cosmologies in the <lb/>multi-verse. <lb/>This theoretical prospect for quantum gravity has some possible applications, though <lb/>of course not directly with black holes. The Leech lattice is a representation of the <lb/>Mathieu group M  24  , which is the automorphism of a Golay code. The Steiner system <lb/>of the octads S(5, 8, 24) defines a binary Golay code in a vector space spanned by the <lb/>octads. The connection to the Cayley plane or OP with F  4  indicates this could be run on <lb/>a quantum computer. The simulation of this quantum gravity model would amount to <lb/>a quantum Golay code encryption or error correction system. A computerized modeling <lb/>of black holes with this exceptional group realization is an encryption system of states, <lb/>which can be used in a real world quantum computerized system of communications. <lb/>The overlap of a state and its time development is <lb/> ||ψ|ψ + δψ| <lb/> 2  = ||ψ|ψ| <lb/> 2 <lb/> − ( H <lb/> 2 <lb/> − − H )δt, <lb/> (42) <lb/>which gives the Berry phase of a state <lb/> φ = <lb/> dt <lb/>  H  2  − − H , <lb/> (43) <lb/>where this is the Fubini-Study metric. This is the phase angle for a principal bundle <lb/> π : H → P H. This principal bundle may be Lie algebra valued. Photons under certain <lb/>conditions may emulate quantum field in curved spacetime [18]. Consider the energy <lb/>eigenvalues of the state space be E  i  = ¯ <lb/> hω which are functions of a one dimensional <lb/>parameter r, which is a function of time r = r(t). The spectrum becomes a continuum <lb/>and frequencies a continuous function of this parameter. This dependency is a Doppler <lb/>shift with frequency spectrum ω <lb/>  = (1 − nv/c)ω, where n is an index of refraction, <lb/> v = dr/dt a velocity and c the speed of light. The index of refraction along the one <lb/>dimensional space is then assumed to vary according to n = n  0  + δn. The Doppler <lb/>equation defines a retarded time 1 − nv/c = ω/ω <lb/>  = ντ for τ = t − r/v. The <lb/>effective frequency ν <lb/>  is then <lb/> ν <lb/>  = <lb/> v <lb/>c <lb/>∂n <lb/>∂τ <lb/> = <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> c <lb/>∂δn <lb/>∂τ <lb/>. <lb/> (44) <lb/></body>

			<body> The Hawking temperature is kT = ¯ <lb/> hα/2π for <lb/> α = − <lb/> 1 <lb/> δn <lb/>∂δn <lb/>∂τ <lb/> (45) <lb/>Now consider the photons in entangled states. In general the SLOCC states in an <lb/>entanglement permit the teleportation of states [12]. Two states are SLOCC related by <lb/>a teleportation if they can be inter-converted to each other in a reversible manner with <lb/>some probability of success. This uses group theory, where the group G  SLOCC  for this <lb/>process is an N-partite system of qubits with some group GL(2, C). The states further <lb/>transform as a (2, 2, . . . , 2). <lb/> G  SLOCC  = SL(2, C)  1  ⊗ SL(2, C)  2  ⊗ . . . ⊗ SL(2, (C)  N  , <lb/> (46) <lb/>where the composite state <lb/> |ψ  12...N  = SL(2, C)  1  ⊗ SL(2, C)  2  ⊗ . . . ⊗ SL(2, C)  N  |φ  12...N  . <lb/> (47) <lb/>This is then an N -partite quantum information system where the entanglements are <lb/>determined by the group element G  SLOCC  and polynomials of this group. This is the <lb/>moduli space for black holes composed of qubits and the U-duality group. <lb/>For a 2 Q-bit system this construction is apparent. You have a stat of the form <lb/> ij  a  ij  |i, j for i and j running form 0 to 1. The elements a  ij  transform as (2, 2) of <lb/>the G  SLOCC  . The invariant element is the determinant of these matrices so det(a  ij  ) <lb/>transformed under the G  SLOCC  into <lb/> det(a  ij  ) → det(a <lb/> ij  ) = det(U  i   i  a  ij  U <lb/>  * <lb/> j   j  ) = det(a  ij  ) <lb/>(48) <lb/>with the obvious result on the determinant of a product that the transformation ele-<lb/>ments have unit determinant. The entanglement entropy is given by this measure so <lb/> S  ij  = 4|det(a  ij  )| <lb/> 2  . For multipartite systems the same rule generally applies, but the <lb/>matrix interpretation is different. For an N-partite system the entanglement entropy is <lb/>given by a 2 × 2 × . . . × 2 (N times) set of elements. This leads to the entangled states <lb/> |00 + |11 and |01 + |10, without normalization, for singlet and triplet entangled <lb/>states. The isomorphism SO(2, 2)  SL(2, C) × SL(2, C) connects the SLOCC state by <lb/>the KS theorem to the local Lorentz symmetry induced optically. <lb/>This may be extended to 3 and 4 qubit systems, such as the W state or cat state, and <lb/>the GHZ state. The algebraic structure is established by the entanglement employed. <lb/>The exceptional E  8  group is decomposed as E  8  → SL(2, R) <lb/> ⊗8  . The entanglement <lb/>SLOCC group is the associated product SL(2, C) <lb/> ⊗8  . There are 8 qubits, where 7 of them <lb/>are spin-valued elements on the Fano-plane and the remainder is a unit element. There <lb/>are 7 triplets of elements which may be ordered, with the additional unit element, and 7 <lb/>four-way multiplications which do not include the unit. Then with 8 qubits there are 14 <lb/>independent basis vectors composed of 4 elements for a state built up accordingly. This <lb/>may then be extended further into the Jordan matrix algebra. <lb/></body>
