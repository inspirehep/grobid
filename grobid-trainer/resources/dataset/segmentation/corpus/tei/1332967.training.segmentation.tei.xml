			<front> HIGHER ORDER MODES DAMPING FOR 9-CELL STRUCTURE WITH <lb/>MODIFIED DRIFT TUBE <lb/> A. Mitrofanov, Ya.Shashkov, N.

			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> Development of accelerating structures for modern <lb/>types of accelerators, such as Energy recovery linacs <lb/>(ERLs), requires special attention to higher order modes <lb/>(HOMs) damping. HOMs excitation could create high <lb/>losses on the cavity walls, beam instability and beam <lb/>break up (BBU). HOMs couplers are often used in such <lb/>structures for HOM damping but they could lead to <lb/>violation of the axial symmetry of the accelerating field <lb/>and create transverse field components (kick-factor) that <lb/>can negatively affect on the beam emittance. Also these <lb/>devices are subject for multipactor discharge and all kinds <lb/>of pollution. Here we are studying different options of <lb/>beam pipes to provide better HOMs propagation from the <lb/>cavity, assuming that they will be dissipated away from <lb/>the cavity. <lb/> INITIAL DESIGN <lb/> As a reference point for simulation HOMs propagation <lb/>was taken 9-cell 1300 MHz superconducting electron <lb/>accelerating cavity (Fig. 1) [1]. In order to estimate <lb/>efficiency we decided to calculate HOM electrodynamics <lb/>characteristics for the structure without couplers and put <lb/>at the end of drift tubes RF port boundary conditions, <lb/>representing ideal loads away from the cavity. <lb/>Figure 1: Superconducting 9-cell cavity model. <lb/>In order to estimate HOM frequency range, we <lb/>calculated dispersion characteristics (Fig. 2) for E 010 <lb/> modes and HOMs. The most dangerous HOMs for the <lb/>structure are dipole modes H 111 , E 110 , EH 11 ; quadrupole <lb/>modes Н  211 and Е  210 and monopole mode Е  011 . <lb/>Figure 2: Dispersion characteristics for main wave and for <lb/>HOMs and β-phase = 1 line. <lb/> β-phase = 1 line is shown on the dispersion <lb/>characteristic on fig 2. Intersection points of dispersion <lb/>characteristics with β-phase = 1 line (synchronous point) <lb/>represent modes with the largest interaction between <lb/>particles and waves and those points needs an additional <lb/>attention. <lb/>External Q-factor values for HOMs and operational <lb/>mode are presented on Fig 3. Q ext values were calculated <lb/>in CST Microwave Studio [2]. <lb/>Figure 3: External Q-factor calculations results for HOMs <lb/>in 9-cell elliptical cavity with beampipes loaded with RF <lb/>ports. Square (red) – monopole waves, circle (blue) – <lb/>dipole waves, diamonds (orange) – quadrupole waves. <lb/>Comparison of the results with results for similar <lb/>structures [3] showed that Q ext for operating mode is <lb/>nearly the same, three orders higher for dipole modes, 4-5 <lb/>order higher for quadrupole modes and for 2 <lb/> nd monopole <lb/>HOM it&apos;s two times higher. <lb/></body>

			<body> FLUTED BEAM PIPE <lb/> We decided to simulate the 9-cell structure with fluted <lb/>beam pipes that was successfully applied for HOMs <lb/>damping in single cell cavities [4]. <lb/>Fluted beam pipes are presented on Fig. 4. Quantity and <lb/>form of those flutes can be chosen on purpose to get more <lb/>damping of HOMs. The best results for damping of dipole <lb/>and quadrupole HOMs were obtained for a structure with <lb/>fluted beam pipes with 3 flutes [5]. The structure with 4 <lb/>flutes has the problem with quadrupole HOMs damping <lb/>with certain polarization. <lb/>Figure 4: Upper left: fluted beam shape with 3 <lb/>inhomogeneities; upper right: schematic view of <lb/>eccentric-fluted beam pipe, designed for KEK-ERL <lb/>model-2 [6]; bottom: fluted beam pipe cavity model. <lb/>The main advantage of fluted beam pipe is that H 21 cut-<lb/>off frequency is below of the quadrupole HOMs band. <lb/>This is true not only for quadrupole but also for dipole <lb/>HOMs. The operational mode remains trapped in the <lb/>structure due to high cut-off frequency of E 01 mode. Cut-<lb/>off frequency values for different modes in fluted beam <lb/>pipe are presented in Table 1. Field distribution in fluted <lb/>beam pipe for E 01 , H 11 and H 21 waves are presented on <lb/>Fig 5. <lb/>Table 1. Cut-off frequencies for different mode in fluted <lb/>beam pipe <lb/> H 11 <lb/> 1330 <lb/>E 01 <lb/> 1972 <lb/>H 21 <lb/> 2004 <lb/> In order to get the same cut-off frequency cylindrical <lb/>beam pipe beam pipe radius should be 65.5 mm for H 11 <lb/> wave and 72.8 mm for H 21 , however it will cause <lb/>reduction for E 01 cut-off frequency (on 248MHz and <lb/>396MHz correspondingly). It could create to negative <lb/>effect for shunt impedance of operating mode. <lb/>Figure 5: Electric (first line) and magnetic (second line) <lb/>fields distribution in fluted beam pipe for E 01 , H 11 and H 21 <lb/> waves. <lb/>Figure 6: External Q-factor calculations results for 9-cell <lb/>elliptical structure with fluted beam pipes loaded at the <lb/>ends with RF ports. Square (red) – monopole waves, <lb/>circle (blue) – dipole waves, rhombus (orange) – <lb/>quadrupole waves. Beam pipe length 300 mm, inner <lb/>radius 54 mm, flutes radius 90 mm <lb/>Comparing Q ext results for the 9-cell structure with <lb/>fluted (Fig. 6) and for cylindrical beam pipes (Fig. 3) and <lb/>results obtained for the similar structures [3], we can <lb/>conclude that this method is very effective because of we <lb/>see reduction of Q ext values were reduced by two orders <lb/>of magnitude monopole and dipole and by five orders for <lb/>quadrupole HOMs. <lb/> RIDGED BEAM PIPE <lb/> Another structure that provides conditions for HOMs <lb/>propagation is ridged beam pipe structure (Fig. 7). The <lb/>ridged beam pipe geometry is symmetrically opposed to <lb/>fluted beam pipe. Typically it has 3 grooves in beam pipe, <lb/>evenly distributed on azimuth on 120º angle. <lb/>After the change initial design to fluted and ridged <lb/>beam pipe structures we used standard method [7] of <lb/>modifying geometry of end cells for field flatness of <lb/>operating mode (Fig 8). <lb/></body>
