			<front> A Bloch-Sphere-Type Model for Two Qubits in the <lb/>Geometric Algebra of a 6-D Euclidean Vector Space <lb/> Timothy F. Havel  a  and Chris J. L. Doran  b <lb/>a  Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <lb/>Cambridge, MA 02139, USA <lb/> b  MRAO, Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, Cambridge, <lb/>CB3 OHE, United Kingdom <lb/> ABSTRACT <lb/> Geometric algebra is a mathematical structure that is inherent in any metric vector space, and defined by the <lb/>requirement that the metric tensor is given by the scalar part of the product of vectors. It provides a natural <lb/>framework in which to represent the classical groups as subgroups of rotation groups, and similarly their Lie <lb/>algebras. In this article we show how the geometric algebra of a six-dimensional real Euclidean vector space <lb/>naturally allows one to construct the special unitary group on a two-qubit (quantum bit) Hilbert space, in a <lb/>fashion similar to that used in the well-established Bloch sphere model for a single qubit. This is then used to <lb/>illustrate the Cartan decompositions and subalgebras of the four-dimensional unitary group, which have recently <lb/>been used by J. Zhang, J. Vala, S. Sastry and K. B. Whaley [Phys. Rev. A 67, 042313, 2003] to study the <lb/>entangling capabilities of two-qubit unitaries. <lb/> Keywords: Lie algebra, geometric algebra, quantum information <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. INTRODUCTION <lb/> The so-called Bloch sphere model of a two-level quantum system is widely used in quantum information pro-<lb/>cessing, and as a visualization aid in quantum physics more generally. Although its origins can be traced back <lb/>to Riemann&apos;s stereographic projection of the unit sphere (minus one point) onto the complex plane, it has since <lb/>been rediscovered several times in variety of physical contexts, including the Stokes vector in optics, <lb/> 1  the Bloch <lb/>vector in nuclear magnetic resonance, <lb/> 2  and the Feynman-Vernon-Hellwarth model of the maser. <lb/> 3  This geomet-<lb/>ric interpretation of the state of a two-level quantum system is based on the fact that the special unitary group <lb/> SU(2) is the two-fold covering group of SO(3), the proper rotations of a three-dimensional vector space, and the <lb/>associated Lie algebra isomorphism so(3) ≈ su(2). This isomorphism is &quot; accidental &quot; in the sense that it does <lb/>not extend to an isomorphism of so(n) with su <lb/> 1 + n(n − 1)/2 <lb/> for some infinite sequence of integers n &gt; 3. <lb/>It does, however, extend to the case n = 6, i.e. so(6) ≈ su(4), which corresponds to a pair of coupled two-level <lb/>quantum systems or, from a quantum information processing perspective, a pair of qubits. <lb/> In this article we construct a geometric model based on a six-dimensional Euclidean vector space for the <lb/>states and transformations of a pair of qubits, and use this model to interpret a parametrization of SU(4) that <lb/>was recently derived from the basic theory of Lie algebras. <lb/> 4, 5 <lb/> It should first be noted that unlike the SU(2) <lb/> vs. SO(3) case, a six-dimensional vector space is not nearly large enough to fully parametrize the 15-dimensional <lb/>group SU(4). This would ordinarily be handled by introducing 6 × 6 rotation matrices parametrized by the <lb/>six-dimensional analog of spherical-polar coordinates, but this does not illuminate the underlying geometry in <lb/>any simple way. Instead, therefore, we will be using a generalization of vector algebra to metric vector spaces <lb/>of all dimensions and signatures, which is best known today as geometric algebra. <lb/> 6, 7  Although this is certainly <lb/>much less widely known than matrix algebra, the intimate links between the structure of geometric algebra and <lb/>the geometry of the underlying vector space makes it the ideal tool for our purposes. Figure 1 attempts to <lb/>put geometric algebra into historical perspective vis-´ a-vis the better known and related (though very different) <lb/>formalisms of algebraic geometry and group representations. <lb/></body>

			<body> Figure 1. The modern theory of geometry was initiated by Felix Klein&apos;s famous Erlanger programme of 1872, which <lb/>promoted the view that &quot; geometry &quot; should be regarded as the study of the invariants of group actions. This led to three <lb/>main lines of mathematical research. The first was known as invariant theory, and used polynomials in the coordinates <lb/>to express geometric properties, and polynomials in these invariants (syzygies) to express geometric relations among the <lb/>properties. It proved too difficult to perform the necessary computations in these terms (at least before computers), and <lb/>was basically subsumed into the more general theory of algebraic curves and surfaces now known as algebraic geometry. <lb/>The other was group representation theory, which was basically invented by Frobenius and was subsequently used to <lb/>develop the abstract theory of Lie algebras developed by Lie and Engel. Geometric algebra was actually initiated by <lb/>Grassmann and, in the form of quaternions, by Hamilton even before Klein launched his programme, and subsequently <lb/>developed by many well-known scientists and mathematicians including Clifford, Peano and Gibbs. Due to a variety of <lb/>historical accidents, it never became as well established as the other main formalisms, although its influence many be seen <lb/>in several subsequent developments, e.g. vector algebra, spinor theory and differential forms; in pure mathematics, it has <lb/>more recently been used in the study Riemannian manifolds under the name of &quot; Clifford algebra &quot; . <lb/> 8  Over the last forty <lb/>years or so, its diverse applications across physics and engineering have gradually become increasingly broadly recognized, <lb/>starting with the work of Baylis, Hestenes and Sobczyk. <lb/> 9–12  A fascinating account of the history of these geometrical <lb/>ideas may be found in a modern book by Isaac M. Yaglom. <lb/> 13 <lb/> This remaining sections of this article are organized as follows. The first section below provides a brief <lb/>introduction to geometric algebra, so as to make this article reasonably self-contained. The next section shows <lb/>how the geometric algebra of a three-dimensional Euclidean vector space applies to the Bloch sphere model. <lb/>This is extended to the six-dimensional model in the following section, using the fact that the even subalgebra <lb/>of its geometric algebra is isomorphic to the usual algebra of complex 4 × 4 matrices. Finally, we consider <lb/>the parametrization of unitary transformations in the model that follows from the isomorphism so(6) ≈ su(4), <lb/> along with possible extensions to more general completely positive linear maps. In closing, we briefly discuss <lb/>the connections of this work to other applications of geometric algebra to quantum mechanics, most notably the <lb/>multiparticle space-time algebra. <lb/> 14–16 <lb/> 2. BASIC CONCEPTS OF GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA <lb/> Like most good mathematical ideas, geometric algebras may be defined in a number of different ways. The <lb/>following definition, taken from Ref. 17, has the advantage that it refers directly to operations and properties <lb/>that we shall subsequently utilize. <lb/> Definition 2.1. An associative algebra over R is the geometric algebra G(p, q) of a metric vector space V with <lb/>nondegenerate quadratic form Q : V → R of signature (p, q) if it contains both R and V as distinct subspaces <lb/>such that: <lb/> • the square of any vector v ∈ V is v <lb/> 2  = Q(v); <lb/> • V generates G(p, q) as an algebra over R; <lb/> • G(p, q) is not generated by any proper subspace of V. <lb/> The algebra determined by these assumptions is unique up to isomorphism and, being semi-simple, also isomor-<lb/>phic to a direct sum of matrix algebras over a real division ring (i.e. the reals, the complex numbers, or the <lb/>quaternions). Note further that in general the algebra G(p, q) contains the vector space V as a proper linear <lb/>subspace; the geometric interpretation of the entities in G(p, q) that are not simply vectors in V will be explained <lb/>shortly. <lb/>As an immediate consequence of the first assumed property, the symmetric part of the geometric product of <lb/>two vectors is the value of the bilinear form defined by Q, since <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2 <lb/> ab + ba <lb/> = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> a <lb/> 2  + b <lb/> 2  − (a − b) <lb/> 2 <lb/> = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> Q(a) + Q(b) − Q(a − b) <lb/> . <lb/> (1) <lb/>We shall henceforth refer to this as the inner product of the vectors, which in keeping with modern conventions <lb/>shall be denoted by a · b. The remaining, antisymmetric part of the geometric product, by way of contrast, is <lb/>referred to as the outer product, and written (following a notation that dates back all the way to Grassmann) as <lb/> a ∧ b ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ab − ba <lb/> . <lb/> (2) <lb/>This outer product may be extended to an associative and totally antisymmetric product of any number of <lb/>vectors via the recursive definition <lb/> a ∧ B  r  ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> aB  r  + (−1) <lb/> r  B  r  a <lb/> r = 1, 2, . . . <lb/> , <lb/> (3) <lb/>with B  1  ≡ b ∈ V. These outer products span the entire real linear space on which G(p, q) is built, and will be <lb/>referred to in the following as r-blades. <lb/> The geometric interpretation of an r-blade is both straightforward and natural. It is the locus of the linear <lb/>equation defined by the outer product of the blade with yet another vector, namely <lb/> L(B  r  ) ≡ <lb/> a ∈ V | a ∧ B  r  = 0 <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>and hence a subspace of the underlying space of simple vectors V. Indeed, the definition of the outer product <lb/>immediately implies that a ∧ b = 0 if and only if a = αb for some scalar α, and hence more generally that <lb/> a ∧ B  r  = 0 ⇔ a = α  1  b  1  + · · · + α  r  b  r <lb/> α  1  , . . . , α  r  ∈ R, B  r  ≡ b  1  ∧ · · · ∧ b  r <lb/> , <lb/> (5) <lb/>i.e. a is linearly dependent on the factors b  1  , . . . , b  r  ∈ V of B  r  . This subspace interpretation justifies the <lb/>convention that the outer product of any r &gt; p + q vectors is identically zero. <lb/>A given orthonormal basis e  1  , . . . , e  n  of the underlying vector space V (n = p + q) induces a basis for G(p, q) <lb/> as a real linear space, which is given by all combinations of outer products of basis vectors in lexicographic order, <lb/>i.e. <lb/>1 <lb/> 1 <lb/> , e  1  , . . . , e  n <lb/> n <lb/> , e  1  ∧ e  2  , . . . , e  n−1  ∧ e  n <lb/> ( <lb/> n <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> , e  1  ∧ e  2  ∧ e  3  , . . . , e  n−2  ∧ e  n−1  ∧ e  n <lb/> ( <lb/> n <lb/> 3  ) <lb/> , . . . , e  1  ∧ · · · ∧ e  n <lb/> 1 <lb/> . <lb/> (6) <lb/>The numbers under each subsequence of r-blades is the dimension <lb/>  n <lb/>r <lb/> of the space of r-vectors that they span, <lb/>and thus the dimension of the entire algebra is <lb/>  n <lb/>r=0 <lb/> n <lb/>r <lb/> = 2 <lb/> n  . <lb/> (7) <lb/>The algebra of outer products is in fact the well-known exterior algebra <lb/> V, which is widely used in the algebraic <lb/>theory of projective geometry. <lb/> 18  In keeping with this field, we will sometimes denote the subspace of r-vectors <lb/> Table 1. <lb/> r <lb/> 1 2 3 4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>8 <lb/> r(r − 1)/2 <lb/>0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 <lb/>(−1) <lb/> r <lb/> − + − + − + − + <lb/>(−1) <lb/> r(r−1)/2 <lb/> + − − + + − − + <lb/>by <lb/> r  V, and in order to avoid confusion with the dimension of V, the number of vectors r in an r-blade will be <lb/>called its grade. <lb/> We now return to the inner product, and similarly extend it to all r-blades via the complementary definition <lb/> a · B  r  ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2 <lb/> aB  r  − (−1) <lb/> r  B  r  a <lb/> r = 1, 2, . . . <lb/> . <lb/> (8) <lb/>As an immediate consequence, we can express the geometric product of a vector and an r-blade as the sum of <lb/>its inner and outer products, <lb/> aB  r  = a · B  r  + a ∧ B  r  . <lb/> (9) <lb/>Unlike the outer product, however, the inner product is not associative, and indeed it is readily verified that <lb/> a · <lb/> a <lb/> ′  · B  r <lb/> = <lb/> a ∧ a <lb/> ′ <lb/> · B  r  = − <lb/> a <lb/> ′  ∧ a <lb/> · B  r  = − a <lb/> ′  · <lb/> a · B  r <lb/> = <lb/> a · a <lb/> ′ <lb/> · B  r  . <lb/> (10) <lb/>Indeed we will w.l.o.g. set α · B  r  = 0 for any scalar α, since these products are not of much use otherwise. Note <lb/>in particular that a · (a · B  r  ) = (a ∧ a) · B  r  = 0 · B  r  = 0. <lb/>In addition to the inner and outer products, there are two unary involutions (mappings which applied twice <lb/>give the identity) in geometric algebras. The first of these is variously known as inversion or the parity operation, <lb/> and denoted with an overbar, e.g. B  r  . This is defined on vectors as multiplication by −1, and extended by <lb/>multilinearity to general r-blades, i.e. <lb/> b  1  ∧ · · · ∧ b  r  ≡ (−1) <lb/> r  b  1  ∧ · · · ∧ b  r  . <lb/> (11) <lb/>It is easily verified that this operation respects the inner, outer and geometric products, i.e. it is an algebra <lb/>automorphism, so that the space of all inversion symmetric multivectors forms a subalgebra under the geometric <lb/>product which is known as the even subalgebra G <lb/> +  (p, q). The other involution is known as reversion. This <lb/>simply reverses the order of the vectors in every r-blade, and is denoted by a tilde, e.g. ˜ <lb/> B  r  or B <lb/> ∼ <lb/> r  . Because the <lb/>outer product is antisymmetric, the net effect is to change the sign of an r-vector whenever the parity of the <lb/>permutation, as a product of transpositions, is odd, i.e. <lb/> b  1  ∧ · · · ∧ b  r <lb/>  ∼  ≡ (−1) ( <lb/> r <lb/> 2  ) b  1  ∧ · · · ∧ b  r  . <lb/> (12) <lb/>Reversion is not an automorphism but rather an anti-automorphism, meaning (AB) <lb/> ∼  = ˜ <lb/> B ˜ <lb/> A. <lb/> Together, these two involutions allow one to say a good deal about the grade of an expression in the algebra. <lb/>For example, a quick look at their definitions shows that the inner and outer products of a vector with an r-vector <lb/> change sign under inversion when r is even but not when r is odd so that, in particular, these products can have <lb/>no r-vector part. On the other hand, the inner product a · B  r  changes sign under reversion when r and r(r − 1)/2 <lb/>are both odd or both even but not otherwise, while for the outer product a ∧ B  r  it&apos;s the other way around. <lb/>The dependence of reversion and inversion symmetry on r is summarized in Table 1, which shows that these <lb/>symmetries allow us to determine the value of r mod 4. It further shows that the change in these symmetries <lb/>on taking the inner and outer products of a vector with an r-vector is most simply explained by the fact that <lb/>the former has rank r − 1 and the latter r + 1 (the latter was of course built into the definition of an r-blade). <lb/> Thus we say that the inner product is grade lowering and the outer grade raising. In fact the inner and outer <lb/>products of an r-blade with an s-blade are most simply defined as <lb/> A  r  · B  s  ≡ A  r  B  s   |r−s|  , <lb/> A  r  ∧ B  s  ≡ A  r  B  s   r+s  , <lb/> (13) <lb/>where  r  denotes the orthogonal projection of the enclosed expression onto the subspace of r-vectors. <lb/> In much of what follows, we shall be using geometric algebra as a means of representing Lie algebras and <lb/>groups. The utility of geometric algebra in this regard stems from the fact that the commutator product of <lb/>bivectors (aka 2-vectors), which we shall write as <lb/> A  2  × B  2  ≡ A  2  B  2  − B  2  A  2  , <lb/> (14) <lb/>is readily shown by its symmetry with respect to inversion and reversion to yield another bivector. In fact the <lb/>bivector algebra under the commutator product is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the special orthogonal group <lb/>(isometries) of the underlying metric vector space, SO(p, q). The exponential map, likewise defined using the <lb/>geometric product, yields a rotor R = exp(B) ∈ G <lb/> +  (p, q) which rotates vectors by conjugation, i.e. a <lb/> ′  = R a ˜ <lb/> R <lb/> (in the remainder of this paper we shall usually drop the grade subscript from our blades, indicating grade instead <lb/>by B =  B  r  . The Lie algebras of the other three main series in their classification, i.e. the symplectic, unitary <lb/>and complex orthogonal, can all be obtained as subalgebras of the orthogonal Lie algebras of higher dimensions. <lb/>In fact, the general linear group GL(n) and its Lie algebra may be obtained by restricting the action of the <lb/>isometries in G(n, n) to the n-dimensional subspace of null vectors, and the classification theory for semisimple <lb/>Lie algebras worked out within this framework. <lb/> 19 <lb/> 3. QUBIT MECHANICS AND THE GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA OF 3-D SPACE <lb/> This section is devoted to a fairly detailed exposition of the geometric algebra of a three-dimensional vector <lb/>space, which will be denoted as G(3) ≡ G(3, 0). This provides an excellent nontrivial example of most of the <lb/>foregoing generalities on geometric algebras. In addition, via the Bloch sphere model of a qubit&apos;s state as a <lb/>three-dimensional unit vector, it will enable us to make a direct connection with quantum mechanics. <lb/>Let e  1  , e  2  , e  3  ∈ V ≈ R <lb/> 3  be an orthonormal basis for a three-dimensional Euclidean space, so that <lb/> e <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  = e <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  = e <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  = 1 and e  i  e  j  = e  i  · e  j  + e  i  ∧ e  j  = e  i  ∧ e  j  = −e  j  ∧ e  i  = −(e  i  e  j  ) <lb/> ∼ <lb/> (15) <lb/>for all 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ 3. Using these relations, it is easily shown that the elements of the induced basis for the <lb/>space of bivectors, denoted by <lb/> E  1  ≡ e  2  e  3  , E  2  ≡ e  3  e  1  , E  3  ≡ e  1  e  2  , <lb/> (16) <lb/>likewise anticommute but square to −1, e.g. <lb/> E <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  = − (e  2  e  3  ) <lb/> ∼  (e  2  e  3  ) = − e  3  (e <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  )e  3  = − e <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  = − 1 <lb/>(17) <lb/>and <lb/> E  1  E  2  = (e  2  e  3  )(e  3  e  1  ) = − e  1  e  2  = − E  2  E  1  . <lb/> (18) <lb/>Similarly, it can be shown that E  1  E  2  E  3  = 1. <lb/>These relations are, up to sign, exactly those which define the quaternion units i, j, k, and the even subalgebra <lb/> G <lb/> +  (3) generated by the bivector units is isomorphic to the full quaternion algebra. Indeed G(3) constitutes a <lb/>seamless merger of vector algebra with the quaternions. The rotor (quaternion) that rotates vectors by an angle <lb/> ϑ in the plane of E  1  is <lb/> R(ϑ) ≡ exp <lb/> (ϑ/2) E  1 <lb/> = <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> k=0 <lb/> (ϑ/2) <lb/> k  E <lb/> k <lb/> 1 <lb/> k! <lb/> = · · · <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> k=0 <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k  (ϑ/2) <lb/> 2k <lb/> (2k)! <lb/>+ E  1 <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> k=0 <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k  (ϑ/2) <lb/> 2k+1 <lb/> (2k + 1)! <lb/>= cos(ϑ/2) + E  1  sin(ϑ/2) , (19) <lb/> as is readily verified, e.g. <lb/> R(ϑ) e  3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/> R(ϑ) = <lb/> cos(ϑ/2) + E  1  sin(ϑ/2) <lb/> e  3 <lb/> cos(ϑ/2) − E  1  sin(ϑ/2) <lb/> = · · · <lb/> cos(ϑ/2) + E  1  sin(ϑ/2) <lb/>  2  e  3  = <lb/> cos(ϑ) + E  1  sin(ϑ) <lb/> e  3  = cos(ϑ) e  3  + sin(ϑ) e  2  , (20) <lb/>where we have used the relations E  1  e  3  = e  2  = −e  3  E  1  (note that this is a left-hand rotation). The appearance <lb/>of the half-angle ϑ/2 in this formula means that rotors constitute a spinor representation of SO(3), which is a <lb/>two-fold cover of SO(3) since ±R(ϑ) both yield the same rotation. <lb/>The ordered product of all three basis vectors I ≡ e  1  e  2  e  3  is variously known as the unit trivector or pseu-<lb/> doscalar. This latter name stems from the fact that it (and all scalar multiples thereof) commute with all the <lb/>basis vectors and hence with the entire algebra G(3) they generate, since <lb/> I e  1  = e  1  e  2  e  3  e  1  = − e  1  e  2  e  1  e  3  = e <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  e  2  e  3  = e  1  I , <lb/> (21) <lb/>and similarly for e  2  , e  3  . Furthermore, I is yet-another square-root of −1, since <lb/> I <lb/> 2  = − I ˜ <lb/> I = − E  3  e <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/> E  3  = − E  3  ˜ <lb/> E  3  = E <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  = −1 . <lb/> (22) <lb/>In other words, I is algebraically identical to an abstract imaginary unit &quot; i &quot; . The difference is that (like the <lb/>basis bivectors above) the unit pseudoscalar admits a geometric interpretation as the oriented volume element <lb/> of space. Its algebraic combination with real vectors, e.g. I e  1  as above, may also be interpreted as the oriented <lb/>areal element in the plane orthogonal to e  1  . This allows us to write the rotor for a right-handed rotation by an <lb/>angle ϑ about an axis â (ˆ a <lb/> 2  = 1) a little more intuitively as <lb/> R  ˆ <lb/> a  (ϑ) = exp <lb/> −I (ϑ/2) ˆ <lb/> a <lb/> = cos(ϑ/2) − I ˆ <lb/> a sin(ϑ/2) . <lb/> (23) <lb/>Finally, we have the relation <lb/> I E  ℓ  = − e  ℓ <lb/> 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 3 <lb/> , <lb/> (24) <lb/>which implies that the cross product of vectors may be expressed in terms of their outer product as <lb/> a × b = ˜ <lb/> I (a ∧ b) . <lb/> (25) <lb/>The state of a qubit is, of course, represented by a unit vector in a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space, <lb/>which at first sight seems very far removed from anything in three-dimensional Euclidean geometry. For someone <lb/>who is already familiar with both, however, the connection may be stated in a single line: the Pauli matrix algebra <lb/>is a representation of the geometric algebra G(3). An isomorphism between them is obtained simply by mapping <lb/>the unit vectors to the corresponding Pauli matrices, i.e. <lb/> e  1  ↔ σ  1  = <lb/> 0 1 <lb/>1 0 <lb/> , e  2  ↔ σ  2  = <lb/> 0 −i <lb/> i 0 <lb/> , e  3  ↔ σ  3  = <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>0 −1 <lb/> , <lb/> (26) <lb/>as may be verified by showing that these matrices satisfy the same algebraic relations as the basis vectors. The <lb/>relations between the multivectors in G(3) and various types of 2 × 2 complex matrices are summarized in Table <lb/>2. In particular, the even subalgebra G <lb/> +  (3) (or quaternions if you prefer) is represented by all real multiples of <lb/> SU(2) matrices, i.e. SU(2) ≈ Spin(3), the multiplicative group of rotors in G <lb/> +  (3). <lb/> Table 2. <lb/> the real numbers <lb/>real multiples of the 2 × 2 identity <lb/>three-dimensional space of vectors <lb/>traceless 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices <lb/>three-dimensional space of bivectors <lb/>traceless 2 × 2 anti-Hermitian matrices <lb/>the pseudoscalars <lb/>imaginary multiples of the 2 × 2 identity <lb/> As simple as this correspondence is, we have yet to say how one represents the state of a qubit in G(3), and <lb/>it is not obvious since they are usually represented by 2 × 1 vectors rather than 2 × 2 matrices. The trick is to <lb/>form a matrix with zeros in its second column, which has the same number of degrees of freedom in it as a 2 × 1 <lb/>vector, and transforms correctly under left-multiplication by SU(2), namely <lb/> | ψ  = <lb/> ψ  1 <lb/> ψ  2 <lb/> ↔ <lb/> ψ  1  0 <lb/> ψ  2  0 <lb/> = <lb/> ψ  1  −ψ <lb/>  * <lb/> 2 <lb/> ψ  2  ψ <lb/>  * <lb/> 1 <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>0 0 <lb/> ↔ Ψ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (1 + e  3  ) = Ψ P  3  , <lb/> (27) <lb/>where Ψ ∈ G <lb/> +  (3) and P  3  ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (1 + e  3  ) is a projection operator, i.e. P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  = P  3  . This is described mathematically <lb/>by saying that spinors form a left-ideal in G(3). <lb/> Having made this identification, we are now ready to complete the job of showing how qubit mechanics can <lb/>be embedded within G(3). Expectation values are computed pretty much as usual, i.e. <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  ψ | A | ψ ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  ψ | a  1  σ  1  + a  2  σ  2  + a  3  σ  3  | ψ  =  P  3  ˜ <lb/>Ψ a ΨP  3   0  =  ˜ <lb/>Ψ a ΨP  3   0  , <lb/> (28) <lb/>where the vector a ≡ a  1  e  1  + a  2  e  2  + a  3  e  3  . On the right-hand side of this equation, we have used P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  = P  3 <lb/> together with the fact that the scalar part &quot;   0  &quot; equals one-half the real part of the trace in the Pauli matrix <lb/>representation. This formula extends readily to ensembles of quantum systems in a mixed state if one defines <lb/>the density operator in G(3) as <lb/> ρ ≡ 2  ΨP  3  ˜ <lb/>Ψ  =⇒  A  =  ρ a  0  , <lb/> (29) <lb/>where the unsubscripted angular brackets now refer to the ensemble average. This latter formula admits a nice <lb/>geometric interpretation if we recall the definition of P  3  and that Ψ ∈ G <lb/> +  (3) rotates vectors by conjugation, so <lb/>that <lb/> ρ = 1 +  Ψe  3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/>Ψ ≡ 1 + b =⇒  A  =  a  0  +  ba  0  =  ab  0  = a · b . <lb/> (30) <lb/>The vector b of course corresponds to the usual Bloch vector, and represents the average state of the qubit over <lb/>the ensemble. <lb/>This last equation implies that the rotor Ψ can be interpreted as an instruction to rotate the reference vector <lb/> e  3  to the Bloch vector of the pure state in question. This has rather interesting implications for the meaning of <lb/>certain features of quantum mechanics. <lb/> 7, 11  It shows that the indeterminate phase of the spinor is nothing but the <lb/>angle of rotation about e  3  , explaining why it has no effect on the state. It also shows why spinors transform with <lb/>the half-angle of the corresponding Euclidean rotation quite simply. The generalization of these interpretations <lb/>to multi-qubit systems has received a considerable amount of attention over the last few years, <lb/> 14–16  and we shall <lb/>now revisit some of this work using a new geometric model for the states and operators of a two-qubit system. <lb/> 4. QUBIT MECHANICS AND THE GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA OF 6-D SPACE <lb/> As mentioned in the Introduction, the Lie algebra isomorphisms spin(6) ≈ so(6) ≈ su(4) imply that it should <lb/>be possible to represent the states and operators of a two-qubit system within the geometric algebra of a six-<lb/>dimensional Euclidean vector space G(6). We will now show by construction how this can actually be done, along <lb/>with the geometric interpretations of the state of a pair of qubits which this isomorphism implies. <lb/> 4.1. The Lie and Matrix Algebra Isomorphisms <lb/> The 15-dimensional Lie algebra su(4) is usually represented by 4 × 4 anti-Hermitian matrices, whereas we shall <lb/>represent the elements of the Lie algebra spin(6) by the 15-dimensional subspace of bivectors in G(6). If we let <lb/> σ <lb/> 1 <lb/> k <lb/> ≡ σ  k  ⊗ σ  0  , σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> k <lb/> ≡ σ  0  ⊗ σ  k  be the tensor products of Pauli matrices with the 2 × 2 identity σ  0  (k = 1, 2, 3), <lb/>then it is readily verified that i times these six matrices and their nine matrix products σ <lb/> 1 <lb/> k <lb/> σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ℓ <lb/> = σ  k  ⊗ σ  ℓ  span the <lb/>15-dimensional space of anti-Hermitian matrices and so generate all of su(4). We shall also let e  1  , e  2  , e  3  , f  1  , f  2  , f  3 <lb/> be an orthonormal basis of V ≈ R <lb/> 6  , and abbreviate the bivectors of ∧  2  V by: <lb/> G  10  ≡ e  2  e  3 <lb/> (and all cyclic permutations over the indices 1, 2, 3) <lb/> G  01  ≡ f  2  f  3 <lb/> (and all cyclic permutations over the indices 1, 2, 3) <lb/>(31) <lb/> G  ij  ≡ e  i  f  j  (−1) <lb/> δij <lb/> (for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3, where δ is the Kronecker delta). <lb/> Then it is easily verified that under the correspondence indicated below the matrix and basis bivectors satisfy <lb/>the same commutation relations, so that the linear mapping defined by this correspondence among the basis <lb/>elements extends to real linear mapping between these two spaces that constitutes an instance of the purported <lb/>isomorphism: <lb/>i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/> 1  ↔ G  10 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  ↔ G  20 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  ↔ G  30 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  ↔ G  01 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  ↔ G  02 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ↔ G  03 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  ↔ G  11 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  ↔ G  21 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  ↔ G  31 <lb/> (32) <lb/>i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  ↔ G  12 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  ↔ G  22 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  ↔ G  32 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>1  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ↔ G  13 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ↔ G  23 <lb/> i σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ↔ G  33 <lb/> Specifically, the bivector basis elements satisfy the following commutation relations: <lb/> G  ik  × G  ik  = 0 <lb/>(for all 0 ≤ i, k ≤ 3) <lb/> G  ik  × G  jℓ  = 0 <lb/>(for all 1 ≤ i, j, k, ℓ ≤ 3 with i  = j and k  = ℓ) <lb/> G  1k  × G  2k  = − G  30 <lb/> (for all 0 ≤ k ≤ 3 and cyclic permutations over the first index) <lb/>(33) <lb/> G  i1  × G  i2  = − G  03 <lb/> (for all 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 and cyclic permutations over the second index) <lb/> G  10  × G  2ℓ  = − G  3ℓ <lb/> (for all 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 3 and cyclic permutations over the first index) <lb/> G  01  × G  j2  = − G  j3 <lb/> (for all 1 ≤ j ≤ 3 and cyclic permutations over the second index) <lb/>A little further inspection quickly shows that not only do these matrices and bivectors correspond under the <lb/>commutator product, but within any three-dimensional subspace the products of these matrices coincides with <lb/>the geometric product of the bivectors. Since the reversion of bivectors corresponds to Hermitian transposition in <lb/>the matrix algebra, reversion symmetric entities in the even subalgebra G <lb/> +  (6) serve as the analogs of Hermitian <lb/>matrices in our six-dimensional model. These entities consist of the scalars and the 4-vectors, which together span <lb/>a real 16-dimensional subspace as they should. The final dimension in the even subalgebra is the pseudoscalar <lb/> I ≡ e  1  e  2  e  3  f  1  f  2  f  3  . This squares to −1, commutes with everything in G <lb/> +  (6) and maps 2-vectors to 4-vectors by <lb/>multiplication (and vice versa). In short, it is clearly a geometric analog of the imaginary unit times the identity <lb/>in the 4 × 4 matrix algebra. <lb/>The next task is to find an analog of the state vectors of pure states, which we shall again regard as a <lb/>left-ideal, i.e. as matrices with all their entries equal to zero outside their first column, in analogy with the state <lb/>vectors of single qubits in G(3) (see above). Since the tensor products of single qubit pure states span the full <lb/>two-qubit Hilbert space in the matrix model, it is reasonable to use the analogous construction here, i.e. <lb/> | φ ⊗ | ϕ ↔ Φ <lb/> 1  P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  Θ <lb/> 2  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ≡ Φ <lb/> 1 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> 1 − Ie  1  e  2 <lb/> Θ <lb/> 2 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> 1 − If  1  f  2 <lb/> = Φ <lb/> 1  Θ <lb/> 2 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> 1 − IG  30  − IG  03  − IG  33 <lb/> , (34) <lb/>where we have written the 4-vector basis elements σ <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  ↔ e  3  f  1  f  2  f  3  and σ <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ↔ e  1  e  2  e  3  f  3  as −I times the <lb/>complementary bivectors. The multivectors Φ <lb/> 1  &amp; Θ <lb/> 2  ∈ G <lb/> +  (6) are actually the sums of scalars and bivectors in <lb/>the even subalgebras G <lb/> +  (3) generated by e  1  , e  2  , e  3  &amp; f  1  , f  2  , f  3  , respectively. Under the geometric product, these <lb/>two four-dimensional even subalgebras generate the full 16-dimensional even subalgebra, and the normalization <lb/>condition Ψ ˜ <lb/>Ψ = 1 on the state vectors ΨP <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ∈ G <lb/> +  (6) ensures that Ψ corresponds to a unitary in the matrix <lb/>algebra. In terms of these matrices, each state vector is identified with the set of all unitary matrices with the <lb/>same first column. <lb/>Geometric analogs of density matrices, henceforth called density operators to distinguish them, may be <lb/>constructed in exactly the same fashion as in the matrix algebra as well. The dyadic (sometimes misnamed the <lb/>outer!) product of a state vector with its Hermitian conjugate clearly corresponds to <lb/> | ψ  ψ | ↔ Ψ P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/>Ψ . <lb/> (35) <lb/>Just as in the Bloch sphere model of a single qubit, this may be regarded as a unitary transformation of the <lb/>density operator of the reference state P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  ↔ | 00  00 | to that corresponding to | ψ  ψ |. General density <lb/> operators ρ ∈ G <lb/> +  (6) may then be obtained by taking convex combinations of those of pure states in the usual <lb/>way. A geometric characterization of the positive semidefiniteness of density matrices does not, alas, fall out <lb/>immediately. The best one can say is that powers of the density operator have scalar parts (four times the trace <lb/>in the matrix representation) that satisfy certain inequalities. Letting <lb/>  ≡ ρ − 1/4 be the &quot; traceless part &quot; of ρ, <lb/> the first of these inequalities are <lb/> 3 <lb/>16  ≥ ˆ <lb/> ρ <lb/> 2   0  , <lb/> 3 <lb/>32  ≥ ˆ <lb/> ρ <lb/> 3   0  , <lb/> 15 <lb/>128  ≥ ˆ <lb/> ρ <lb/> 4   0  . <lb/> (36) <lb/>Somewhat more insight into the geometry of pure states can be obtained from the well-known Schmidt <lb/>decomposition. This is usually written as a convex combination of tensor products of one-qubit states, but with <lb/>a little work one can parametrize all the quantities appearing therein in terms of angles plus an overall scale <lb/>factor, i.e. <lb/> | ψ  = ̺ e <lb/> −iφ <lb/> cos(ς/2) e <lb/> −iτ /2 <lb/> cos(ϑ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> −iϕ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2 <lb/> sin(ϑ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> iϕ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2 <lb/> ⊗ <lb/> cos(ϑ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> −iϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2 <lb/> sin(ϑ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> iϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2 <lb/> + · · · <lb/> sin(ς/2) e <lb/> iτ /2 <lb/> sin(ϑ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> −iϕ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2 <lb/> − cos(ϑ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> iϕ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2 <lb/> ⊗ <lb/> sin(ϑ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> −iϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2 <lb/> − cos(ϑ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2)e <lb/> iϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2 <lb/> . (37) <lb/>The analog of this decomposition in G <lb/> +  (6) is <lb/>Ψ = ̺ e <lb/> −Iφ  e <lb/> −ϕ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2 G30−ϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2 G03  e <lb/> −ϑ <lb/> 1 <lb/> /2 G20−ϑ <lb/> 2 <lb/> /2 G02  e <lb/> −τ /2 (G30+G03)  e <lb/> −ς/2 G22  P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  . <lb/> (38) <lb/>Although this may at first glance appear formidable, the interpretation of each factor in it is actually fairly <lb/>straightforward. In left-to-right order, first two parameters are the overall magnitude ̺ (usually set to unity) <lb/>and overall phase angle φ. The next factor contains the azimuthal angles ϕ <lb/> 1  , ϕ <lb/> 2  of the Bloch vectors of the two <lb/>qubits, as rotations in the planes of the bivectors G  30  , G  03  respectively. The next two contain the altitudinal <lb/>angles ϑ <lb/> 1  , ϑ <lb/> 2  of the Bloch vectors as rotations in the G  20  , G  02  planes. Thereafter we have the parameter τ which <lb/>equals the sum of the two angles of rotation about the reference directions of the two Bloch vectors, because the <lb/>difference G  30  − G  03  is projected to zero by the idempotents P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  . The corresponding exponential rotates the <lb/>two components obtained on expansion of the last factor in opposite directions, namely <lb/>exp <lb/> − ς/2 G  22 <lb/> = cos(ς/2) − G  22  sin(ς/2) . <lb/> (39) <lb/>The entanglement of the state is usually measured in terms of the entropy <lb/> − cos(ς/2) log <lb/> cos(ς/2) <lb/> − sin(ς/2) log <lb/> sin(ς/2) <lb/> , <lb/> (40) <lb/>and depends only upon this last angle. <lb/>As an example, we consider the maximally entangled singlet state | ψ ≡ (| 10 − | 01 )/ <lb/>√ <lb/> 2, which has the <lb/>Schmidt parameters <lb/> ̺ = 1 , φ = τ = ϕ <lb/> 1  = ϕ <lb/> 2  = ϑ <lb/> 1  = 0 , ϑ <lb/> 2  = π , ς = − π/2 . <lb/> (41) <lb/>It follows that the state is represented by <lb/>Ψ ≡ − G  02 <lb/>1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1 + G  22 <lb/> P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  = <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/> G  20  − G  02 <lb/> , <lb/> (42) <lb/>which corresponds to the density operator <lb/>Ψ P <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/> ˜ <lb/>Ψ = <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> 1 − IG  11  − IG  22  − IG  33 <lb/> (43) <lb/>The next section will show that this is invariant under simultaneous rotations of both qubits together. <lb/> Figure 2. Combinatorial graph in which the vertices correspond to the basis vectors for a Bloch sphere model of each of <lb/>the two qubits ([e  1  , e  2  , e  3  ] &amp; [f  1  , f  2  , f  3  ], respectively) and the edges to the corresponding bivector basis Gij . The dashed <lb/>ellipses enclose the induced subgraphs which correspond to the &quot; local &quot; subalgebras of the two Bloch sphere models, while <lb/>the perfect matching of a Cartan subalgebra is indicated by the heavier lines on edges of G11, G22, G33. <lb/> 4.2. Cartan Decompositions and Subalgebras <lb/> Thus far, we have not done anything with our six-dimensional model and geometric algebra that could not <lb/>be done in the matrix algebra – which is probably a good thing since the matrix algebra is evidently able to <lb/>handle all of nonrelativistic qubit mechanics! Nevertheless, we hope to show that the additional degrees of <lb/>freedom present in our model do allow for some efficiency in notation, or at least serve a pneumonic in keeping <lb/>track of commutation relations. To this end we shall identity the basis vectors e  1  , . . . , f  3  with the vertices of a <lb/>combinatorial graph, and the corresponding bivector basis G  ij  with the edges (pairs of vertices) in the graph, as <lb/>depicted in Fig. 2. Any two nonidentical edges meeting at a common vertex then correspond to anticommuting <lb/>bivectors, while any pair of edges with no vertex in common correspond to commuting bivectors. Furthermore <lb/>the commutator of any pair of bivectors, the edges of which have a vertex in common, equals the bivector of <lb/>the edge connecting the other pair of vertices up to sign. From this one sees immediately that the edges in any <lb/>induced subgraph (i.e. a subset of the vertices together with all the edges between them), as bivectors, generate <lb/>a subalgebra e of the full bivector algebra. In addition, all the bivectors in this subalgebra commute with all <lb/>those bivectors with their edges in the complementary induced subgraph f (i.e. that induced by the complement <lb/>of the subgraph&apos;s vertex set), and hence the product of these two subalgebras g ≡ e × f = f × e = e ⊕ f is again a <lb/>subalgebra. And finally, the commutator of any bivector in g with a basis bivector, the edge of which connects a <lb/>vertex of the subgraph to a vertex outside of it, is either zero or else a bivector outside g of the same kind, while <lb/>the commutator of any two basis bivectors outside g is either zero or a bivector in the subalgebra. <lb/>Subalgebras of a Lie algebra which &quot; absorb &quot; their orthogonal complements like this are known as Cartan <lb/> decompositions. <lb/> 20  Their importance lies in the role they play in parametrizing Lie group of the full subalgebra, at <lb/>least in some neighborhood of the identity. To describe this fully, we need to also introduce the related concept <lb/>of a Cartan subalgebra, which is a subalgebra h generated by a maximal set of commuting basis bivectors in g <lb/> ⊥ <lb/> (note that any noncommuting set of basis bivectors would not generate a subalgebra h ⊂ g <lb/> ⊥  ). Then if l is the <lb/>full Lie algebra in question and G, H and L are the Lie groups corresponding to the Lie algebras g, h and l, <lb/> respectively, we have <lb/> L = G H G , <lb/> (44) <lb/>where the juxtaposition of Lie groups on the right-hand side indicates the composition of all possible pairs of <lb/>elements from these subgroups of L in the given order. For want of a better name, we shall call this a Cartan <lb/> factorization of the group. <lb/>The applications of Cartan factorizations to quantum control were first developed by Khaneja &amp; Glaser, <lb/> 4 <lb/> and their implications for the geometry of nonlocal two-qubit operations has been nicely worked out by Zhang <lb/> et al., <lb/> 5  to which references the reader is directed for a full account. Here we are mainly interested in what new <lb/>insights our six-dimensional model and the graph theory notation for its bivectors can provide. <lb/>The most useful Cartan factorization, with regard to the &quot; local &quot; structure of SU(4), is that indicated by the <lb/>dashed ellipses in Fig. 2 as well as by our chosen notation. Each of the two sets of basis vectors {e  i  }, {f  j  } <lb/> generates a subalgebra G(3) of G(6), showing how the Bloch vector model of each qubit is embedded as a pair <lb/>of complementary three-dimensional orthogonal subspaces in six-dimensions. Any complete bipartite matching <lb/> between the corresponding complementary sets of three vertices each in the graph, i.e. any set of three edges <lb/>between the two sets with no vertices in common, then corresponds to a Cartan subalgebra; the most symmetric <lb/>choice is G  11  , G  22  , G  33  , as indicated in the figure. Equation (44) then says that any rotation in six dimensions <lb/>can be uniquely written as pair of rotations in complementary three-dimensional subspaces, rotations in three <lb/>mutually orthogonal planes each intersecting both three-dimensional subspaces in a line, and another pair of <lb/>rotations on the three-dimensional subspaces. This is of course perfectly analogous to the parametrization of <lb/> spin(3) by Euler angles, in which a three-dimensional rotation is expressed as a rotation about the z-axis, followed <lb/>by a rotation about the x-axis and finally a second z-rotation – and which can also be derived from a Cartan <lb/>decomposition. <lb/>As an example, consider the Cartan factorization of a unitary that maps between the local or computational <lb/>basis of a four-dimensional Hilbert space and the corresponding basis of Bell states. The matrix of this unitary <lb/>versus the local basis has the Bell states as its columns, <lb/> Q ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 1 0 0 <lb/>i <lb/>0 i 1 0 <lb/>0 i −1 0 <lb/>1 0 0 −i <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/> (45) <lb/>and its Cartan factorization, up to an overall phase (exercise!), may be written as <lb/>exp <lb/> − ϑ(G  01  − G  02  + G  03  ) <lb/> exp <lb/> ϑ(G  10  − G  20  + G  30  ) <lb/> exp <lb/> (π/4) G  33 <lb/> · · · <lb/> exp <lb/> (π/ <lb/> √ <lb/> 8)(G  20  − G  30  ) <lb/> exp <lb/> − ϑ(G  01  + G  02  + G  03  ) <lb/> , <lb/> (46) <lb/>where ϑ = 4π/ <lb/> √ <lb/> 27. As noted in Ref. 21, this unitary transformation has the curious property of taking <lb/>the Pauli matrices into i times a set of anti-symmetric real matrices, which in turn generate the Lie algebra <lb/> so(4) ≈ so(3) ⊕ so(3). <lb/> Although it makes this isomorphism manifest in the standard Pauli matrix representation, Q defines a <lb/>relatively complicated mapping into the Bell basis. Indeed, it seems there is no way to identify the subalgebra <lb/> g = so(3) ⊕ so(3) with a four-dimensional subspace within our six-dimensional model. A much simpler mapping <lb/>into the Bell basis is defined by <lb/> Q <lb/> ′  ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 1 <lb/>0 0 1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 1 0 <lb/>0 −1 1 0 <lb/> −1 0 0 1 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/> (47) <lb/> which has the Cartan factorization <lb/>exp <lb/> − ϑ(G  01  + G  02  + G  03  ) <lb/> exp <lb/> iϑ(G  10  + G  20  + G  30  ) <lb/> exp <lb/> (π/4) G  33 <lb/> · · · <lb/> exp <lb/> ϑ(G  01  + G  02  + G  03  ) <lb/> exp <lb/> − ϑ(G  10  + G  20  + G  30  ) <lb/> , <lb/> (48) <lb/>and is therefore just a single rotation in the plane of the bivector G  21  . The action of Q &amp; Q <lb/> ′  on the full set of <lb/> su(4) generators is summarized in Table 3, which indicates by their position in the table to which basis bivector <lb/>each basis bivector is mapped by this transformation. <lb/> Table 3.

There are of course other types of unitary transformations that can also <lb/>produce entanglement, for example the SWAP or particle interchange operator, <lb/> Π ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> 1 + IG  11  + IG  22  + IG  33 <lb/> = exp <lb/> (π/4) (G  11  + G  22  + G  33  ) <lb/> . <lb/> (49) <lb/>This is clearly a simultaneous rotation of one of the two qubits&apos; subspaces onto the other, such that the chosen <lb/>coordinate frames coincide. Clearly the same rotation is obtained however these two frames are chosen, so long <lb/>as they remain parallel with one another. The generator of this rotation is also intimately connected to the <lb/>singlet state, the density operator of which likewise contains it (Eq. (43)). This can be regarded as an intuitive <lb/>explanation for the singlet&apos;s invariance under simultaneous joint rotations of both qubits. <lb/> 7 <lb/> 5. CLOSING REMARKS <lb/> In this article have briefly surveyed some of the insights that our model of two qubits in the geometric algebra of a <lb/>six-dimensional Euclidean vector space can provide. There are certainly many more to come. For one, the graph <lb/>theoretical interpretation of the bivector algebra makes it clear that any bipartition of a set of orthonormal basis <lb/>vectors will give rise to a Cartan decomposition, and that any maximal bipartite matching between the vertex <lb/>sets will be a Cartan subalgebra. For example, the bipartition {e  1  , f  1  } &amp; {e  2  , f  2  , e  3  , f  3  } gives a subalgebra <lb/> g isomorphic to so(2) ⊕ so(4), which is seven dimensional. A Cartan subalgebra h is generated by G  30  , G  03  , <lb/>providing another two degrees of freedom, and allowing us to generate all of SO(6) with 7+2+7 = 16 parameters. <lb/>Because SO(6) is only 15 dimensional, there is clearly an ineffective degree of freedom. To identify it, we factorize <lb/> SO(4) using the Cartan decomposition g <lb/> ′  obtained from the further bipartition {e  2  , f  2  } &amp; {e  3  , f  3  }, together with <lb/>a matching Cartan subalgebra h <lb/> ′  generated by G  10  , G  01  . Then since G  33  = e  3  f  3  commutes with the generators <lb/> G  30  , G  03  in the first Cartan subalgebra h, the difference of their corresponding multipliers in the exponentials <lb/>is clearly ineffective, and we have shown that SU(4) can also be written as a product of exponentials in the <lb/>following sets of generators in right-to-left order: <lb/> {G  22  , G  33  }, {G  10  , G  01  }, {G  11  , G  22  }, {G  30  , G  03  , G  33  }, {G  11  , G  22  }, {G  10  , G  01  }, {G  22  , G  33  }, <lb/> (50) <lb/>where we have combined the middle two copies of G  33  ∈ g <lb/> ′  into the first Cartan subalgebra h for simplicity. <lb/> There is also a close connection between Cartan and Schmidt decompositions, in that the latter may be <lb/>obtained from the former simply by dropping all parameters that are ineffective when the transformation is <lb/>applied to the projectors P <lb/> 1 <lb/> 3  P <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  . It might be interesting to work out what the 15 − 6 = 9 ineffective parameters <lb/>are in the above Cartan factorization when it is used to derive a Schmidt-like decomposition in this way. There <lb/>are, of course, many others as well. <lb/>We have not yet paid much attention to the odd grade entities in G(6), but there are reasons to believe they <lb/>may provide additional notational efficiency in the description of various completely positive trace-preserving <lb/>linear maps of G <lb/> +  (6) into itself. For example, Kraus sums of the form <lb/> M  k  ρ ≡ ρ + <lb/> 1 <lb/>4  e  k  ˆ <lb/> ρ e  k <lb/> k = 1, . . . , 6 ; ˆ <lb/> ρ ≡ ρ − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> (51) <lb/>may be shown to lie on the boundary of the convex set of all completely positive trace-preserving linear maps. <lb/>By composing these maps together in all possible ways and taking convex combinations, we expect to obtain the <lb/>full 96-dimensional space of such maps. It would be particularly interesting to see if certain physically important <lb/>processes (such as the nuclear Overhauser effect in NMR <lb/> 22  ), which cannot be described by a small number of <lb/>Kraus operators in the matrix algebra, admit more concise description when sums involving odd entities are also <lb/>utilized. <lb/>Finally, we point out that although the so(3) ≈ su(2) and so(6) ≈ su(4) isomorphisms do not extend to <lb/>larger numbers of qubits, geometric algebra has been used to derive a complete and relativistically covariant <lb/>theory of multi-qubit systems. <lb/> 14–16  Like the six-dimensional model dealt with here, these higher spin models <lb/>introduce additional degrees of freedom which, although apparently physically irrelevant, may nevertheless be <lb/>of some mathematical utility. It could be a useful exercise to derive the six-dimensional model from within the <lb/>framework of this more general theory, and gain more insight into the these extraneous degrees of freedom. <lb/></body>
