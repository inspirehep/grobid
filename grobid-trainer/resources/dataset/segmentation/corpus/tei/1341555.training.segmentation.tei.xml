			<front> THE GROMOV-WITTEN POTENTIAL OF A POINT, HURWITZ <lb/>NUMBERS, AND HODGE INTEGRALS <lb/> I.P. GOULDEN, D.M. JACKSON, AND R. VAKIL <lb/> Abstract. Hurwitz numbers, which count certain covers of the projective <lb/>line (or, equivalently, factorizations of permutations into transpositions), have <lb/>been extensively studied for over a century. The Gromov-Witten potential F <lb/> of a point, the generating series for Hodge integrals on the moduli space of <lb/>curves, has been a central object of study in Gromov-Witten theory. We define <lb/>a slightly enriched Gromov-Witten potential G (including integrals involving <lb/>one &quot; λ-class &quot; ), and show that after a non-trivial change of variables, G = H <lb/> in positive genus, where H is a generating series for Hurwitz numbers. We <lb/>prove a conjecture of Goulden and Jackson on higher genus Hurwitz numbers, <lb/>which turns out to be an analogue of a genus expansion ansatz of Itzykson and <lb/>Zuber. As consequences, we have new combinatorial constraints on F , and a <lb/>much more direct proof of the ansatz of Itzykson and Zuber. <lb/>We can produce recursions and explicit formulas for Hurwitz numbers; the <lb/>algorithm presented should prove &quot; all &quot; such recursions. Furthermore, there are <lb/>many more recursions than previously suspected from geometry (and indeed <lb/>they should exist in all genera); as examples we present surprisingly simple <lb/>new recursions in genus up to 3 that are geometrically mysterious. <lb/>As we expect this paper also to be of interest to combinatorialists, we <lb/>have tried to make it as self-contained as possible, including reviewing some <lb/>results and definitions well known in algebraic and symplectic geometry, and <lb/>mathematical physics. <lb/></front>

Introduction <lb/> The moduli space M  g,n  of n-pointed genus g curves, with stability condition <lb/>2g − 2 + n &gt; 0 <lb/>(1) <lb/>has dimension <lb/>3g − 3 + n. <lb/> (2) <lb/>It is the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space M  g,n  of smooth <lb/> n-pointed genus g curves. It has n natural line bundles L  i  (roughly, the cotangent <lb/>space to the ith marked point) and a natural rank g vector bundle E (the Hodge <lb/>bundle; its fibers corresponds to global differentials on the curve. Let ψ  i  = c  1  (L  i  ) <lb/>and λ  k  = c  k  (E), where c  j  is the j-th Chern class; intersections of ψ-classes are <lb/>called descendant integrals, and intersections of ψ-classes and λ-classes are called <lb/> Hodge integrals (see [FbP1] for fuller information). <lb/>The Gromov-Witten potential F of a point (Witten&apos;s total free energy of two-<lb/>dimensional gravity) is a generating series for all descendant integrals. Witten&apos;s <lb/>conjecture (Kontsevich&apos;s theorem, [K]) and the Virasoro conjecture for a point can <lb/>be expressed as the fact that e <lb/> F  is annihilated by certain differential operators (see <lb/>[G] for example). We define G as a generalization of F (Section 2), a generating <lb/>series for all intersections of ψ-classes and (up to) one &quot; λ-class &quot; . (This is part of <lb/>the very large phase space of [MZ].) Then F can be easily recovered from G. <lb/> Hurwitz numbers enumerate covers of the projective line by smooth connected <lb/>curves of specified degree and genus, with specified branching above one point, <lb/>simple branching over other specified points, and no other branching. Equivalently, <lb/>they are purely combinatorial objects counting factorizations of permutations into <lb/>transpositions that generate a group which acts transitively on the sheets. Hurwitz <lb/>numbers have long been of interest (see, for example, [H], [V3] for more recent <lb/>references, and [CT] for relation to mathematical physics). Let H be a generating <lb/>series for Hurwitz numbers (defined precisely in Section 2). <lb/></body>

			<body> It is straightforward (if tedious) to produce expressions for Hurwitz numbers <lb/>for any given degree (see [H] and [EEHS] for degrees up to 6), but geometrical <lb/>arguments are required for obtaining expressions for fixed genus and it is the latter <lb/>that we consider. <lb/>1.1. Recursions and Gromov-Witten theory. One proof of the power of the <lb/>theory of stable maps is the large number of striking recursions it has produced for <lb/>solutions to classical problems in enumerative geometry, often as consequences of <lb/> &quot; topological recursion relations &quot; . The original example was Kontsevich and Manin&apos;s <lb/>remarkable recursion for rational plane curves ([KM] Claim 5.2.1). Eguchi, Hori, <lb/>and Xiong [EHX] used the Virasoro conjecture to find a recursion for genus 1 <lb/>plane curves (proved in [P] and [DZ]). Similar recursive structure also underlies <lb/>characteristic numbers in low genus ([EK], [V2], [GP2]). <lb/>There are strong analogies between plane curves and covers of the projective <lb/>line. Similar techniques in Gromov-Witten theory have produced recursions for <lb/>Hurwitz numbers (see [FnP] pp. 17–18 or [V2] Section 5.11 for a summary), in-<lb/>cluding a genus 2 relation conjectured by Graber and Pandharipande and proved <lb/>in [GJ2]. Ionel has produced recursions using topological recursion relations and <lb/>the Virasoro conjecture ([I]). Geometers have thought that recursions among Hur-<lb/>witz numbers should be rare, and should not occur in high genus. Philosophically, <lb/>Section 4 shows that in fact recursions are &quot; thick on the ground &quot; , and that there <lb/>is an algorithm for producing (and verifying) them. It is expected that only a few <lb/>will have straightforward (and enlightening) geometric explanations. (It would be <lb/>interesting to reverse the Gromov-Witten approach and, for example, to produce <lb/>relations in the cohomology of M  g,n  using recursions, but this does not seem to be <lb/>tractable.) <lb/>Recurrences can be obtained in the more general setting of ramified coverings <lb/>of surfaces of higher genera. These were considered by Hurwitz ([H]). When his <lb/>approach is carried out by means of a cut-and-join analysis, the resulting partial <lb/>differential equation (e.g. see Section 4.2) is, of course, identical to the one for the <lb/>sphere, although the initial conditions are different. It is then a straightforward <lb/>matter to write down the recurrence for arbitrary ramification over infinity. [LZZ] <lb/>have obtained such a recurrence by other methods, although boundary conditions <lb/>were not included (see also [LZZ] Thm. B and [GJV] Lemma 3.1). <lb/>1.2. Organization of the paper. We first show that, after a non-trivial change <lb/>of variables (denoted by Ξ), G = H in positive genus (Theorem 2.5). Hence the <lb/>Gromov-Witten potential of a point is a purely combinatorial object in a new way. <lb/>The proof uses a remarkable formula of Ekedahl, Lando, Shapiro, and Vainshtein <lb/>([ELSV] Theorem 1.1) expressing Hurwitz numbers in terms of Hodge integrals. In <lb/>some sense this addresses an obstacle to dealing with descendant integrals, the fact <lb/>that they &quot; do not admit so easily of an enumerative application &quot; ([G] p. 1). (Of <lb/>course, Kontsevich&apos;s original formula ([K] p. 10) is also combinatorial, and much <lb/>more useful.) However, the awkwardness of the change of variables makes it difficult <lb/>to transpose results between &quot; the world of H &quot;  (involving Hurwitz numbers) and <lb/> &quot; the world of G &quot;  (involving the moduli space of curves). <lb/></body>

			<body> Second, we prove a generalization (Theorem 3.1) of an ansatz of Itzykson and <lb/>Zuber ([IZ] (5.32), hereinafter the &quot; [IZ] genus expansion ansatz &quot; ). The philosophy <lb/>behind the [IZ] genus expansion ansatz is that, for a fixed genus, starting from a <lb/>finite number of descendant integrals (involving those monomials in the ψ&apos;s where <lb/>each ψ-class appears with multiplicity at least two), one can calculate any descen-<lb/>dant integral using only the string equation and the dilaton equation. The [IZ] <lb/>genus expansion ansatz algebraically encodes this fact. <lb/>Thirdly, we use this to prove a conjecture of Goulden and Jackson on Hurwitz <lb/>numbers (Theorem 3.2, [GJ2] Conjecture 1.2), revealing it as a &quot; genus expansion <lb/>ansatz for Hurwitz numbers &quot; . The erstwhile mysterious combinatorial constants in <lb/>the conjecture are actually single Hodge integrals. <lb/>As an application, we observe that there are trivial combinatorial recurrences on <lb/> H, which lead to new conditions satisfied by G (and hence F ). It would be desirable <lb/>to give a new proof of Witten&apos;s conjecture using the combinatorics of covers of the <lb/>projective line. (Not surprisingly, this appears to be very difficult, and the authors <lb/>have made little progress in this direction.) As a second application, Theorem 3.2 <lb/>provides an algorithm for proving and producing recursions for Hurwitz numbers. <lb/>We produce simple (and surprising) new recursions in genus up to 3 as examples of <lb/>the algorithm&apos;s effectiveness. Theorem 3.2 also yields explicit formulas for Hurwitz <lb/>numbers of any given genus; we give an example (27) in genus 3. <lb/>1.3. For combinatorialists. Conjecture 1.2 [GJ2] came from a combinatorial ap-<lb/>proach to Hurwitz&apos;s encoding of ramified covers, and the proof given here suggests <lb/>that further combinatorial questions of substance remain to be investigated (for <lb/>example, the combinatorialization of Hodge integrals). Therefore, to make this pa-<lb/>per more accessible to combinatorialists, we specify the essential results that are <lb/>taken without proof from algebraic and differential geometry. These are the stabil-<lb/>ity condition (1) and dimension condition (2) for M  g,n  , λ  k  = 0 unless 0 ≤ k ≤ g, <lb/> the convention λ  0  = 1, the genus condition (4) for the nonvanishing of Hodge in-<lb/>tegrals, the evaluation (6) of the base values τ <lb/> 3 <lb/>0   0  , τ  1   1  and λ  1   1  , the string (7) <lb/>and dilaton (9) equations for Hodge integrals, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula (11) <lb/>for the genus of a ramified cover and the result (12) of Ekedahl, Lando, Shapiro <lb/>and Vainshtein relating Hurwitz numbers to Hodge integrals. References are given <lb/>to sources where the proofs of these are to be found. All of our work with Hodge <lb/>integrals is through the dilaton and string equation which, in a real sense, removes <lb/>the need to use the primary definition (3) of Hodge integrals. We also use Faber&apos;s <lb/>program [Fb]. <lb/>It is hoped that, for the most part, the remainder of the paper can be read <lb/>without recourse to algebraic or differential geometry. <lb/>2. Background <lb/> We begin with the necessary background on the generating series F, G and H <lb/> that are central to the subject of this paper. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2.1. Algebraic notation. Suppose α is the composition d = α  1  + · · · + α  m  where <lb/>the α  i  are non-negative integers. Set l(α) = m, the length of α, and let # Aut(α) <lb/>be the number of automorphisms of the multiset {α  1  , α  2  , . . . , α  m  } (so if β  j  of the <lb/> α  i  &apos;s are j, then # Aut(α) = β  0  !β  1  ! . . . ). If the α  i  are positive and non-decreasing, <lb/>we write α ⊢ d, and α is a partition. If, furthermore, all α  i  are at least 2, we write <lb/> α |= d. <lb/> Throughout, t = (t  0  , t  1  , . . . ) and p = (p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) where t  0  , t  1  , . . . and p  1  , p  2  , . . . <lb/> are indeterminates. Thus, for example, Q[[t]] = Q[[t  0  , t  1  , . . . ]] and Q[[x, p]] = <lb/> Q[[x, p  0  , p  1  , . . . ]]. If Z is a polynomial in t, let <lb/> t <lb/> k 0 <lb/> 0 <lb/> k0!  . . . <lb/> t <lb/> k i <lb/>i <lb/> ki! <lb/> Z be the coefficient <lb/>of <lb/> t <lb/> k 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> k0!  . . . <lb/> t <lb/> k i <lb/>i <lb/> ki!  in Z. <lb/> Functional equations of the form v = xg(v), where v ∈ Q[[x]] and g(0)  = 0, have <lb/>a unique solution v(x) in Q[[x]] and an explicit expression for f (v), where f is an <lb/>arbitrary series, may be obtained by Lagrange inversion (see, for example [GJ3] <lb/>Section 1.2; also known as Lagrange&apos;s Implicit Function Theorem). We will invoke <lb/>Lagrange inversion a number of times, particularly when deriving explicit expres-<lb/>sions for certain Hurwitz numbers. <lb/>2.2. The Gromov-Witten and enriched Gromov-Witten potentials F and <lb/> G of a point. Recall that ψ  i  (resp. λ  k  ) is a codimension 1 (resp. k) Chow class <lb/>on M  g,n  where 1 ≤ i ≤ n (resp. 0 ≤ k ≤ g; λ  0  = 1). For non-negative integers <lb/> θ  1  , . . . , θ  n  define <lb/> τ  θ1  . . . τ  θn  λ  k   g  = <lb/> Mg,n <lb/> ψ <lb/> θ1 <lb/> 1  . . . ψ <lb/> θn <lb/>n  λ  k <lb/> (3) <lb/>if <lb/>3g − 3 + n = <lb/> θ  i  + k <lb/> (4) <lb/>and 2g − 2 + n &gt; 0, and is 0 otherwise. (Condition (4) arises because non-zero inter-<lb/>sections can only occur when the sums of the codimension of the classes intersected <lb/>equals the dimension 3g − 3 + n of the space M  g,n  .) The condition equivalent to (4) <lb/>for τ <lb/> b0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> b1 <lb/> 1  . . . λ  k   g  is <lb/> k = <lb/> (1 − i)b  i  + 3g − 3. <lb/>(5) <lb/>In sums involving Hodge integrals it is convenient to include k as a summation <lb/>index, but then to recall that the condition (either (4) or (5)) on k is implicit. <lb/>When k = 0, this agrees with the usual definition. In particular, <lb/> τ <lb/> 3 <lb/>0   0  = 1, <lb/> τ  1   1  = λ  1   1  = <lb/>1 <lb/>24 <lb/> . <lb/> (6) <lb/> Definition 2.1. Let g ≥ 0. The genus g Gromov-Witten potential of a point is <lb/> F  g  (t) = <lb/> n≥0 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n! <lb/> θ1,...,θn≥0 <lb/> t  θ1  . . . t  θn  τ  θ1  . . . τ  θn   g  . <lb/> where the sum is constrained by (4) with k = 0. <lb/></body>

			<body> The Gromov-Witten potential of a point is <lb/> F = <lb/> g≥0 <lb/> y <lb/> g−1  F  g  . <lb/> The genus g enriched Gromov-Witten potential of a point is <lb/> G  g  (t) = <lb/> n≥0 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n! <lb/> θ1,...,θn≥0,0≤k≤g <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k  t  θ1  . . . t  θn  τ  θ1  . . . τ  θn  λ  k   g  . <lb/> where the sum is constrained by (4). <lb/>The enriched Gromov-Witten potential of a point is <lb/> G = <lb/> g≥0 <lb/> G  g  y <lb/> g−1  . <lb/> It will be convenient to use G  g  in the form <lb/> G  g  (t) = <lb/> a1,a2,...≥0,0≤k≤g <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k  τ <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> a1 <lb/> 1  . . . λ  k   g <lb/> t <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0 <lb/> a  0  ! <lb/> t <lb/> a1 <lb/> 1 <lb/> a  1  ! <lb/> . . . <lb/> where the sum is constrained by (5). (The (−1) <lb/> k  in the definition of G  g  is included <lb/>to make the change of variables simpler.) Note that F  0  = G  0  . Note also that F <lb/> can be recovered from G by substituting v <lb/> 1−i  t  i  for t  i  , and v <lb/> 3  y for y, and letting <lb/> G <lb/> #  (t, y, v) be the resulting generating series in the t  i  , y, and v. Then F (t, y) = <lb/> G <lb/> #  (t, y, 0) and G(t, y) = G <lb/> #  (t, y, 1). Phrased differently, if t  i  is given degree 1 − i <lb/> and y is given degree 3, then G  g  has terms only in degrees 0 to g, and F  g  is the <lb/>degree 0 part of G  g  . Also, <lb/> t <lb/> l0 <lb/> 0 <lb/> l  0  ! <lb/> . . . <lb/>t <lb/> li <lb/>i <lb/> l  i  ! <lb/> v <lb/> k <lb/> G <lb/> # <lb/> g  = (−1) <lb/> k  τ <lb/> l0 <lb/> 0  . . . τ <lb/> li <lb/>i  λ  k   g  . <lb/> The following equations facilitate the systematic elimination of τ  0  and τ  1  from <lb/>the Hodge integrals. Let a  0  , a  1  , . . . be non-negative integers. The string equation <lb/> (or puncture equation) is <lb/> τ <lb/> a0+1 <lb/> 0 <lb/> τ <lb/> a1 <lb/> 1  . . . λ  k   g  = <lb/> i≥0 <lb/> a  i+1  τ <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0  . . . τ <lb/> ai+1 <lb/>i <lb/> τ <lb/> ai+1−1 <lb/>i+1 <lb/> . . . λ  k   g  , <lb/> (7) <lb/>unless g = 0, k = 0, a  0  = 2, and all other a  i  are zero (in which case the left hand <lb/>side is τ <lb/> 3 <lb/>0   0  = 1 by (6)). In genus 0, for example, <lb/> M0,n <lb/> ψ <lb/> θ1 <lb/> 1  . . . ψ <lb/> θn <lb/>n  = <lb/> n − 3 <lb/> θ  1  , . . . , θ  n <lb/> (8) <lb/>by a trivial induction from the string equation (observe that one of the θ  i  has to <lb/>be zero, so the string equation may be applied) with τ <lb/> 3 <lb/>0   0  = 1 as the base case. <lb/>The dilaton equation is <lb/> τ <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> a1+1 <lb/> 1 <lb/> τ <lb/> a2 <lb/> 2  . . . λ  k   g  = <lb/> 2g − 2 + <lb/> i <lb/> a  i <lb/> τ <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> a1 <lb/> 1  τ <lb/> a2 <lb/> 2  . . . λ  k   g  , <lb/> (9) <lb/></body>

			<body> unless g = 1, k = 0, and a  i  are all zero (in which case the left hand side is <lb/> τ  1   1  = 1/24 by (6)). The proofs of the string and dilaton equations are the same <lb/>as the usual proofs (for example, [L] p. 191) when no λ-class is present so we <lb/>suppress them. In particular, by induction, we obtain the following repeated form <lb/>of the dilaton equation from the dilaton equation: if a = a  0  + a  1  + · · · , then <lb/> τ <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> a1 <lb/> 1  τ <lb/> a2 <lb/> 2  . . . λ  k   g  = <lb/>(a + 2g − 3)! <lb/>(a + 2g − 3 − a  1  )! <lb/> τ <lb/> a0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> a2 <lb/> 2  . . . λ  k   g <lb/> (10) <lb/>(except when the equation does not make sense, i.e. when g = 0 and a − a  1  &lt; 3, or <lb/> g = 1 and a − a  1  = k = 0), expressing the consequence of eliminating each τ  1  . The <lb/>string and dilaton equations can be easily translated into differential equations for <lb/> G  g  . <lb/> 2.3. The Hurwitz generating series H. Fix a genus g, a degree d, and a par-<lb/>tition (α  1  , . . . , α  m  ) of d with m parts. Let <lb/> r = d + m + 2(g − 1), <lb/>(11) <lb/>so a branched cover of P <lb/> 1  , with monodromy above ∞ given by α, and r other spec-<lb/>ified simple branch points (and no other branching) has genus g (by the Riemann-<lb/>Hurwitz formula). Let H <lb/> g <lb/>α  be the number of such branched covers that are con-<lb/>nected. (We do not take the branched points over ∞ to be labelled.) <lb/>Ekedahl, Lando, Shapiro and Vainshtein have announced a remarkable for-<lb/>mula ([ELSV] Theorem 1.1) <lb/> H <lb/> g <lb/>α  = <lb/> r! <lb/> # Aut(α) <lb/> m <lb/> i=1 <lb/> α  i <lb/>αi <lb/> α  i  ! <lb/> Mg,m <lb/> 1 − λ  1  + · · · ± λ  g <lb/>  (1 − α  i  ψ  i  ) <lb/>(12) <lb/>that expresses Hurwitz numbers in terms of Hodge integrals. (In their statement, <lb/>Λ  g;n  should be replaced by Λ <lb/> ∨ <lb/> g;n  ; Λ  g;n  is the Hodge bundle E.) One should be <lb/>cautious before using this formula when (g, m) = (0, 1) or (0, 2) (as the moduli <lb/>functor M  g,m  is not a Deligne-Mumford stack), but we will not use these two <lb/>degenerate cases. <lb/>A proof of (12) using virtual localization ([GP1]) in the moduli space of stable <lb/>maps to P <lb/> 1  will appear in [GV]. It will also be explained there how (12) would follow <lb/>quickly from virtual localization on an appropriate &quot; relative &quot; moduli space, not yet <lb/>defined in the algebraic category (yielding relative Gromov-Witten invariants; see <lb/>[LR] Section 7 and [IP] for discussion in the symplectic category, and [Ga] for some <lb/>discussion in the algebraic category in the case g = 0). In the case where there <lb/>is no ramification above ∞ (i.e. α = (1 <lb/> d  )), the argument reduces to Fantechi and <lb/>Pandharipande&apos;s independent proof of (12), [FnP] Theorem 2. <lb/> Definition 2.2. The Hurwitz generating series is <lb/> H = <lb/> g≥0 <lb/> H  g  y <lb/> g−1  , <lb/> where H  g  is the generating series <lb/> H  g  = H  g  (x, p) = <lb/> d≥1,α⊢d <lb/> H <lb/> g <lb/>α <lb/> r! <lb/>p  α  x <lb/> d <lb/></body>

			<body> for the H <lb/> g <lb/> α  , p  α  and x are indeterminates, and where 2 − 2g = d − r + l(α). <lb/> Note that e <lb/> H  counts all covers, not just connected ones. (H  g  is denoted by F  g <lb/> in [GJ2].) <lb/>Goulden and Jackson have conjectured that H  g  is of a particular form in terms <lb/>of an implicitly defined set of variables {φ  i  (s, p) : i ≥ 0} defined as follows. Let <lb/> φ  i  (z, p) = <lb/> n≥1 <lb/> n <lb/> n+i <lb/> n! <lb/>p  n  z <lb/> n  , <lb/> (13) <lb/>where i is an integer, be a formal power series (called ψ  i  (z, p) in [GJ2]). Then, <lb/>through the functional equation <lb/> s = xe <lb/> φ0(s,p)  , <lb/> (14) <lb/> s is uniquely defined as a formal power series in x (and p). <lb/> In particular, H  0  and H  1  are given in (23) and (24), respectively. The remaining <lb/> H  g  are the subject of the following conjecture. <lb/> Conjecture 2.3 (Goulden-Jackson [GJ2] Conj. 1.2). For g ≥ 2, <lb/> H  g  (x, p) = <lb/> 5g−5  <lb/> e=2g−1 <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1 − φ  1  (s, p))  e <lb/>e+g−1  <lb/> n=e−1 <lb/> θ|=n <lb/>l(θ)=e−2(g−1) <lb/> K <lb/> g <lb/>θ <lb/> # Aut(θ) <lb/> φ  θ1  (s, p)φ  θ2  (s, p) . . . <lb/> (15) <lb/> for some rational numbers K <lb/> g <lb/>θ  . <lb/> We prove this conjecture (Theorem 3.2). Remarkably, each unknown constant <lb/> K <lb/> g <lb/>θ  turns out to be a single Hodge integral, up to sign. <lb/> Remark 2.4. Goulden and Jackson proved Conjecture 2.3 for g = 2, and conjec-<lb/>tured explicit values for certain K <lb/> g <lb/>θ  (for g = 3 and all θ [GJ2] Appendix A, and <lb/>for (e, l(θ)) = (2g − 1, 1) and all admissible g and n [GJ2] p. 3); we discuss these <lb/>further in Section 3.3. <lb/>2.4. The relationship between H  g  and G  g  . The following is a useful result that <lb/>connects H  g  and G  g  .

The formula (12) applies when <lb/> l(α) ≥ 3, so if H  g  [m] is the summand of H  g  corresponding to all α with l(α) = m, <lb/> then <lb/> H  0  = H  0  [1] + H  0  [2] + <lb/> m≥3 <lb/> H  0  [m] = H  0  [1] + H  0  [2] + Ξ G  0  , <lb/> so <lb/> H  0  = H  0  [1] + H  0  [2] + Ξ F  0  . <lb/> de Jong has pointed out that the change of variables Ξ is not invertible. In other <lb/>words, ignoring the irrelevant variable x by setting it equal to 1, Ξ is not invertible. <lb/>To see this, let ρ : p  n  −→ np  n  and σ : t  n  −→ t  n+1  . Then ρΞ = Ξσ.

The following is a generalization of the [IZ] genus <lb/>expansion ansatz. This argument also gives a much more direct proof of the original <lb/>[IZ] genus expansion ansatz, by &quot; setting λ  k  = 0 &quot; for k &gt; 0 (excising terms for all <lb/> θ such that <lb/> j  (1 − j)θ  j  + 3g − 3 &gt; 0).

Essentially the formal derivation here <lb/>(like the work of [IZ]) is to write an explicit formula for G  g  in terms of primitive <lb/>Hodge integrals. Viewed in this way, it is clear there are only finitely many degrees <lb/>of freedom for each genus (as there are only finitely many primitive Hodge integrals <lb/>for a fixed genus); the interesting part is the precise form. <lb/> Proof. Let ∆ = <lb/> m≥0  t  m+1  ∂  m  − ∂  0  . Then, from the string equation (7), <lb/>∆G  g  (t) = 0, <lb/>for g &gt; 0, and G  g  (t) is the unique such series with the initial value G  g  (0, t  1  , . . . ) at <lb/> t  0  = 0. We begin the proof by exploiting this uniqueness to establish that <lb/> G  g  (t) = G  g  (0, I  1  , I  2  , . . . ), for g &gt; 0. <lb/>(20) <lb/>Let ζ  i  = 0 if i &lt; 0 and 1 if i ≥ 0.

Thus ∆G  g  (0, I  1  , I  2  , . . . ) = 0.

			<body> ([IZ] (5.30), [EYY] (3.7), [DW]). The difference − <lb/> 1 <lb/> 24  φ  0  (s, p) can be seen to be the <lb/>contribution to Ξ G  1  (t) from λ  1  . <lb/>Surprisingly, the picture is least clear in genus 0. F  0  (t) = G  0  (t), and the dif-<lb/>ference H  0  (x, p) − Ξ G  0  (t) arises from where (12) breaks down: it is a generating <lb/>series for covers of P <lb/> 1  with at most 2 pre-images of ∞, H  0  [1](x, p) + H  0  [2](x, p). <lb/> By [GJ0] or [D], <lb/> H  0  [1](x, p) = φ  −2  (x, p). <lb/> By [A] or [GJ0], <lb/> H  0  [2](x, p) = <lb/> i,j≥1 <lb/> (i + j − 1)! <lb/>(i − 1)!(j − 1)! <lb/> i <lb/> i−1  j <lb/> j−1  p  i  p  j  x <lb/> i+j  . <lb/> From (16), Ξ F  0  (t) + H  0  [1](x, p) + H  0  [2](x, p) = H  0  (x, p) so, using formula (8) for <lb/> F  0  and [GJ0] Theorem 1.1 for H  0  , this gives an explicit relation. However, it does <lb/>not seem enlightening. <lb/> Remark 3.3. Using Theorem 3.2, it follows that the conjectures of Goulden and <lb/>Jackson described in Remark 2.4 are true. The conjectured values of K <lb/> 3 <lb/> θ  can be <lb/>checked using Faber&apos;s program [Fb]. The conjectured values of K <lb/> g <lb/>θ  for e = 2g − 1, <lb/> l(θ) = 1 (involving coefficients of <lb/> z/2 <lb/> sin(z/2) <lb/>  k+1 <lb/> ) turn out to be equivalent to [FbP1] <lb/>Theorem 2 and [ELSV] Theorem 1.2. <lb/>4. Consequences and applications <lb/> 4.1. Combinatorial comments on Hodge integrals. The terms that appear in <lb/>Conjecture 2.3 can be given, in principle, a combinatorial interpretation. The left <lb/>hand side already has a combinatorial interpretation, through Hurwitz&apos;s encoding, <lb/>in terms of transitive ordered factorizations of permutations into transpositions. <lb/>For the right hand side, n <lb/> n+i  is the number of rooted (vertex-) labelled trees <lb/>with i + 1 marked vertices (vertices may be multiply marked). The generating <lb/>series for this number is φ  i  (z, p), where p  n  records the number of vertices in a tree. <lb/> φ  0  (z, p) is therefore the number of rooted labelled trees with exactly one marked <lb/>vertex. Similar interpretations can therefore be given to s and 1/(1 − φ  1  (s, p)) <lb/> e  . <lb/> The right hand side therefore has an interpretation in terms of structures obtained <lb/>by gluing together and ordering collections of rooted labelled trees with marked <lb/>vertices. This suggests that K <lb/> g <lb/>θ  , which has been identified up to sign as a Hodge <lb/>integral through Theorem 3.2, can be defined purely combinatorially, provided the <lb/>mapping between the structures corresponding to the left hand and right hand sides <lb/>of (15) is made explicit. In particular, this would involve determining how markers <lb/>attached to the vertices of the trees from the right hand side encode transitive <lb/>ordered factorizations of permutations into transpositions, that occur on the left <lb/>hand side of (15). This is, of course, where the difficulty lies since the theorem itself <lb/>provides no information about the elementwise action of such a mapping. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.2. Consequences of Theorem 2.5. Theorem 2.5 gives a new combinatorial <lb/>structure on G (and hence F ), and one could hope to prove results about F using H, <lb/> i.e. the combinatorics of branched covers. For example, there is a simple differential <lb/>operator T (the &quot; cut-and-join &quot; operator) annihilating e <lb/> H  , corresponding to the <lb/>interpretation of H as counting factorizations of permutations ([GJ0] Lemma 2.2, <lb/>and independently [V1] p. 8), defined as follows. <lb/>Define H <lb/> #  = H <lb/> #  (x, y, u, p) by substituting xu <lb/> 2  for x, yu <lb/> 2  for y, and p  i  u <lb/> 1−i  for <lb/> p  i  in H  g  . Then H <lb/> # <lb/> g  = <lb/> d≥0,α⊢d <lb/>H <lb/> g <lb/> α <lb/> r!  p  α  x <lb/> d  u <lb/> r  where r = l(α)+d+2g −2 is the number <lb/>of simple branch points (now marked by u). Let <lb/> T = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> a,b≥1 <lb/> (a + b)p  a  p  b <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  a+b <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/> y <lb/>abp  a+b <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  a <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  b <lb/> − <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂u <lb/>. <lb/> Then T e <lb/> H <lb/> #  = 0, and H <lb/> #  is uniquely determined by this equation and the condition <lb/> H <lb/> #  (x, y, 0, p) = p  1  x (i.e. there is only one cover of P <lb/> 1  unbranched away from ∞). <lb/> Note that, even the string equation becomes mysterious when translated to a <lb/>statement about H: <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂t  0 <lb/> H = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> t <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  + x <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂x <lb/>H. <lb/> It is not combinatorially clear why this should be true. <lb/>4.3. Comments on the connexion between H and G (and F ). It is worth <lb/>noting how the variables used by physicists to study F (and that are equally useful <lb/>for G) have exactly paralleled the variables used by combinatorialists to study H. <lb/> Specifically, physicists (and geometers) write F in terms of: <lb/>P1. The variables t  i  ; F  g  , G  g  ∈ Q[[t]] are naturally generating series for all Hodge <lb/>integrals. <lb/>P2. For g &gt; 1, F  g  and G  g  lie in a much smaller ring. Via the genus reduction <lb/>ansatz, Theorem 3.1, F  g  and G  g  can be rewritten as elements of Q[1/(1 − <lb/> I  1  ), I  2  , I  3  , . . . ], and this representation is particular simple (as only a finite <lb/>number of monomials appear, and their coefficients are each single Hodge <lb/>integrals). <lb/>P3. It is often physically enlightening ([IZ], [EYY]) to rewrite the above in terms <lb/>of other variables. Let u  0  = ∂ <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  F  0  . Then for g &gt; 1, <lb/> F  g  , G  g  ∈ Q[1/∂  0  u  0  , ∂  0  u  0  , ∂ <lb/> 2 <lb/>0  u  0  , . . . ] <lb/>(and in fact F  g  has a particular bigrading in terms of these variables, where <lb/>deg ∂ <lb/> r <lb/> 0  u  0  = (1, r − 1)). In [EYY], these variables are used in the proof of the <lb/>[IZ] genus reduction ansatz. It is not hard to translate between the ∂ <lb/> r <lb/> 0  u  0  and <lb/>the I  k  ; in particular, u  0  = I  0  ; see [EYY] p. 284. <lb/>Combinatorialists write H in terms of: <lb/>C1. The variables x and p  i  ; H  g  ∈ Q[[x, p]] is a generating series for all Hurwitz <lb/>numbers. <lb/></body>

			<body> C2. In fact, for g &gt; 1, H  g  lies in a much smaller ring: <lb/> H  g  ∈ Q[1/(1 − φ  1  (s, p)), φ  2  (s, p), φ  3  (s, p), . . . ], <lb/>which via Ξ is the same as P2 above. <lb/>C3. Also, H  g  lies in Q[[φ  0  (x, p), φ  1  (x, p), . . . ]]; via Ξ this is the same as P1 above. <lb/>4.4. Applications of Theorem 3.2. Along with techniques from [GJ2], Theo-<lb/>rem 3.2 gives a machine for developing and proving recurrences and explicit formulas <lb/>for Hurwitz numbers, given that the necessary Hodge integrals can be calculated by <lb/>Faber&apos;s program [Fb]. As an example, in [GJ2], a conjectured recursion of Graber <lb/>and Pandharipande was proved using the Theorem in genus 2 (proved there). We <lb/>now give further examples. <lb/>The examples are for the case in which there is no ramification over ∞. We will <lb/>refer to the corresponding numbers as simple Hurwitz numbers. They are obtained <lb/>by setting p  1  = 1 and p  i  = 0 for i  = 1. Under this specialization, φ  i  (x, p) = x for <lb/>all i, and, from (14), s = w where w is the unique solution of <lb/> w = xe <lb/> w  , <lb/> and is given explicitly by <lb/> w = <lb/> n≥1 <lb/> n <lb/> n−1  x <lb/> n <lb/> n! <lb/>. <lb/> Then H  g  becomes <lb/> H  g  = <lb/> d≥1 <lb/> H <lb/> g <lb/> (1  d  ) <lb/> (2d + 2g − 2)! <lb/> x <lb/> d  , <lb/> the generating series for simple Hurwitz numbers. <lb/> Example 4.1 (A recurrence equation for genus 3). From a geometric perspective, <lb/> &quot; it is not likely such simple recursive formulas [similar to Graber-Pandharipande&apos;s <lb/>formula in genus 2, and simpler recursions in genus 0 and 1 [V3] Theorem 2.7 <lb/>(our intercalation)] occur in g ≥ 3 &quot; ([FnP] p. 18). However, using Theorem 3.2, <lb/>recurrences can be obtained as follows. Let D = x d/dx. Then <lb/> D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0  (x) = w, <lb/> H  1  (x) = <lb/>1 <lb/>24 <lb/> log(1 − w) <lb/> −1  − w <lb/> , <lb/> H  2  (x) = <lb/>1 <lb/>5760 <lb/> 4w <lb/> 2 <lb/> (1 − w)  4  + <lb/>28w <lb/> 3 <lb/> (1 − w)  5 <lb/> , <lb/> H  3  (x) = <lb/>1 <lb/>80640 <lb/> w <lb/> 2 <lb/> (1 − w) <lb/> 6  + <lb/>73 <lb/>90720 <lb/> w <lb/> 3 <lb/> (1 − w) <lb/> 7  + <lb/>37 <lb/>5184 <lb/> w <lb/> 4 <lb/> (1 − w) <lb/> 8 <lb/> + <lb/>89 <lb/>5184 <lb/> w <lb/> 5 <lb/> (1 − w) <lb/> 9  + <lb/>245 <lb/>20736 <lb/> w <lb/> 6 <lb/> (1 − w) <lb/> 10  . <lb/> These are from [GJ2], although the final two can now be obtained from Theorem 3.2, <lb/>with the help of Faber&apos;s program [Fb] to compute the necessary Hodge integrals. <lb/>It is convenient to set w = 1 − W <lb/> −1  , so D = W <lb/> 2  (W − 1)d/dW . Then D <lb/> n  <lb/> H  g  (x) <lb/>is a polynomial in W provided 2g − 2 + n &gt; 0. (The resemblance to the stability <lb/></body>

			<body> condition for M  g,n  is probably not coincidental; D can be interpreted as marking <lb/>a point above a fixed general point of P <lb/> 1  .) For (g, n) = (0, 1), (0, 2), D <lb/> n  <lb/> H  g  (x) is a <lb/>rational series in W. A number of these series are given below. <lb/> D <lb/> H  0  (x) = (1 − W <lb/> −2  )/2 <lb/> H  1  (x) = <lb/>log(W )W − W + 1 <lb/>24W <lb/> D <lb/> H  1  (x) = (W − 1) <lb/> 2  /24 <lb/> H  2  (x) = (W − 1) <lb/> 2  W <lb/> 2  (−6 + 7 W ) /1440 <lb/> H  3  (x) = (W − 1) <lb/> 2  W <lb/> 4 <lb/> · <lb/> 720 − 6696 W + 19250 W <lb/> 2  − 21840 W <lb/> 3  + 8575 W <lb/> 4 <lb/> /725760. <lb/> Various relations can be found between the D <lb/> n  <lb/> H  g  (x) for (g, n)  = (0, 0), (1, 0) by <lb/>positing a general form for them and equating coefficients of powers of W to obtain <lb/>a set of linear equations for the parameters appearing in this form. <lb/>With the form containing the twenty six terms <lb/> D <lb/> p  <lb/> H  i <lb/> D <lb/> q  <lb/> H  j <lb/> for p + q = 4, <lb/> i + j = 3, and D <lb/> p  <lb/> H  i  , for i = 3, 1 ≤ p ≤ 4, for i = 2, 1 ≤ p ≤ 5, and for <lb/> i = 1, 1 ≤ p ≤ 7, the null space has dimension 11. (We choose this form for <lb/>potential recursions because this is the form of the recursions previously produced <lb/>via Gromov-Witten theory.) Thus further conditions on the parameters may be <lb/>applied, although it is not at all clear whether there is a geometrically natural <lb/>choice to make. One such expression, obtained by imposing linearity, is <lb/>2880 <lb/> H  3  = − <lb/> 2 <lb/>49 <lb/> − <lb/> 227 <lb/>294 <lb/> D + <lb/>99845 <lb/>588 <lb/> D <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  2 <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>490 <lb/> D <lb/> 2  − <lb/> 11 <lb/>294 <lb/> D <lb/> 3  + <lb/>38845 <lb/>14112 <lb/> D <lb/> 4  − <lb/> 1225 <lb/>576 <lb/> D <lb/> 5 <lb/> H  1  . <lb/> This gives the following explicit formula for H <lb/> 3 <lb/>(1  d  )  linearly in terms of H <lb/> 2 <lb/>(1  d  )  and <lb/> H <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1  d  )  : <lb/>2880 H <lb/> 3 <lb/>(1  d  )  = − <lb/> 24 − 454 d + 99845 d <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2d + 4 <lb/>2 <lb/> H <lb/> 2 <lb/>(1  d  ) <lb/> 294 <lb/>+d <lb/> 2 <lb/> −288 + 5280 d − 388450 d <lb/> 2  + 300125 d <lb/> 3 <lb/> 2d + 4 <lb/>4 <lb/> H <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1  d  ) <lb/> 5880 <lb/> . <lb/> Similar recursions exist for all genera, and these may be obtained in the same <lb/>way. <lb/> Example 4.2 (Another recurrence equation for genus 3, of &quot; geometric form &quot; ). As <lb/>another example to show how common recursions are, we give a genus 3 recursion <lb/></body>

			<page> 16 <lb/></page>

			<body> that is of a potentially geometrically meaningful form: <lb/> H <lb/> 3 <lb/> (1  d  )  = f (d) <lb/> d <lb/> 2 <lb/> H <lb/> 2 <lb/>(1  d  )  + <lb/> i+j=d <lb/> g(i, j) <lb/> 2d + 2 <lb/>2i − 2 <lb/> ijH <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  i  )  H <lb/> 3 <lb/>(1  j  ) <lb/> +h(i, j) <lb/> 2d + 2 <lb/>2i <lb/> ijH <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1  i  )  H <lb/> 2 <lb/>(1  j  ) <lb/> . <lb/> where f (d), g(i, j), and h(i, j) are polynomials of low degree. <lb/>Any formula coming from a divisorial relation on the space of maps would <lb/>have such a form. Even though such a divisorial relation should not exist, a <lb/>geometrically-motivated recursion might still exist of this form; the recursion for <lb/>genus 1 plane curves of [EHX] has this property, for example. One might hope for <lb/>some geometrical understanding from such a recursion. <lb/>The terms on the right-hand side of the equation correspond to divisors on the <lb/>space of maps. The first term corresponds to degree d genus 2 covers where two of <lb/>the d points mapping to the same point of P <lb/> 1  are attached; hence the multiplicity <lb/>of <lb/>  d <lb/> 2 <lb/> . The second term corresponds to maps where the cover is a genus 0 degree i <lb/> cover (a general such cover has 2i − 2 branch points) and a genus 3 degree j cover <lb/>(a general such cover has 2j + 4 branch points) such that two points mapping to <lb/>the same point of P <lb/> 1  (one on each component) are glued together; the multiplicity <lb/> ij comes from the choice of the two points, and the multiplicity <lb/>  2d+2 <lb/>2i−2 <lb/> comes from <lb/>partitioning the branch points between the two components. The third corresponds <lb/>to maps where the cover is a genus 1 degree i cover and a genus 2 degree j cover with <lb/>a point of one glued to a point of the other; the multiplicity calculation is similar <lb/>to the second term. These divisors might appear with various multiplicities, given <lb/>by the polynomials f , g and h. <lb/> Unfortunately, many such recursions can be found (by the same method as in <lb/>Example 4.1), even if the degrees of f , g, and h are required to be small. One such <lb/>is <lb/> f (d) = <lb/>1 <lb/>1702263010 <lb/>(1532127678d − 2213123851), <lb/> g(i, j) = − <lb/> 2 <lb/>121590215 <lb/>(760192125ij − 12054428314i <lb/> −2006745110j + 1033797958), <lb/> h(i, j) = − <lb/> 4 <lb/>2553394515 <lb/>(798201731250ij − 217500288725i <lb/> −473678414332j − 42109762821). <lb/>There seems to be no reason why this recursion should admit a geometrical expla-<lb/>nation. <lb/> Example 4.3 (A recurrence equation for genus 2). The method of Example 4.1 <lb/>can be applied to the genus 2 case; we suppress the details. The linear differential <lb/>equation that is satisfied is <lb/>4320 <lb/> H  2  (x) = −300D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  1  + 7 <lb/> D <lb/> 5  − D <lb/> 4 <lb/> H  0  . <lb/></body>

			<page> 17 <lb/></page>

			<body> The corresponding linear recurrence equation is <lb/>180H <lb/> 2 <lb/> (1  d  )  = −25d <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2d + 2 <lb/>2 <lb/> H <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1  d  )  + 7d <lb/> 4  (d − 1) <lb/> 2d + 2 <lb/>4 <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  d  )  . <lb/> For genus 2 and 3, H <lb/> g <lb/> (1  d  ) <lb/> has been expressed in terms of H <lb/> g−1 <lb/> (1  d  ) <lb/> and H <lb/> g−2 <lb/> (1  d  ) <lb/> . A <lb/>reason this is not entirely unexpected is that D preserves the parity of the degree <lb/>of polynomials in W. But the degree in W of D <lb/> n  H <lb/> g  (x) is 2n + 5g − 5, and the <lb/>parity of this mod 2 is the parity of g − 1 mod 2. Polynomials of both parities are <lb/>required on the right hand side in the posited form of the differential equation to <lb/>match terms on the left hand side. This is to be expected to persist for g ≥ 2. <lb/> Example 4.4 (Recurrence equations for genus 1 and 0). The parity argument in <lb/>the previous example suggests that, if there is a recurrence equation, it must be <lb/>of degree (at least) two for the genus 1 case, and indeed a degree two example is <lb/>known (due to Graber and Pandharipande, [V2] Section 5.11 or [FnP] p. 18). This <lb/>recurrence can be rewritten as the differential equation <lb/> D <lb/> H  1  = D <lb/> 3  <lb/> H  0  /24 − D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0  /24 + <lb/> D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0 <lb/> D <lb/> H  1 <lb/> which is an immediate consequence of the observations that D <lb/> H  1  (x) = (W −1) <lb/> 2  /24, <lb/>D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0  (x) = 1 − W <lb/> −1  and and D <lb/> 3  <lb/> H  0  (x) = W − 1. <lb/>An even simpler recursion exists originating from the differential equation <lb/> D <lb/> H  1  = <lb/>1 <lb/>24 <lb/> D <lb/> 3  <lb/> H  0 <lb/>  2 <lb/> . <lb/> This gives <lb/> H <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1  d  )  = <lb/>1 <lb/> d <lb/> 2d <lb/>4 <lb/>  d−1  <lb/> i=1 <lb/> i <lb/> 3  (d − i) <lb/> 3 <lb/> 2d − 4 <lb/>2i − 2 <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  i  )  H <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  d−i  )  . <lb/> (25) <lb/>The differential equation is an immediate consequence of the above expressions for <lb/> D <lb/> H  1  and D <lb/> 3  <lb/> H  0  . Although it might not be difficult to prove (25) geometrically, <lb/>there was no geometrical reason to suspect its existence. <lb/>The sphere is included for completeness from this point of view. Again, by <lb/>the parity argument, a recurrence of degree two is expected. The simplest such <lb/>differential equation is <lb/> D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0 <lb/>  2 <lb/> + D <lb/> H  0  , <lb/> which is an immediate consequence of the observations that D <lb/> 2  <lb/> H  0  (x) = 1 − W <lb/> −1 <lb/> and D <lb/> H  0  (x) = (1 − W <lb/> −2  )/2. The resulting recurrence equation is <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  d  )  = <lb/>1 <lb/> d(d − 1) <lb/> 2d − 2 <lb/>2 <lb/>  d−1  <lb/> i=1 <lb/> i <lb/> 2  (d − i) <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2d − 4 <lb/>2i − 2 <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  i  )  H <lb/> 0 <lb/>(1  d−i  )  , <lb/> (26) <lb/>which is a well known recurrence found by Pandharipande (see [V2] Section 5.11 or <lb/>[FnP] p. 17). Other (more complicated) genus 0 recurrences can also be found in <lb/>this manner. <lb/></body>

			<body> Example 4.5 (Closed form expressions for simple Hurwitz numbers). Closed form <lb/>expressions for simple Hurwitz numbers can be found for all genera (using the <lb/>method of [GJ2] Cor. 4.1). The expression for the genus g case can be obtained <lb/>from Theorem 3.2, with the specializations of p, s and φ  i  given above, and is the <lb/>following. <lb/> H <lb/> g <lb/> (1  d  ) <lb/> (2d + 2g − 2)! <lb/>= <lb/> x <lb/> d <lb/> H  g  (x) = <lb/> 5g−5  <lb/> r=2g−1 <lb/>r+g−1  <lb/> n=r−1 <lb/> K  n,g,r <lb/> x <lb/> d <lb/> w <lb/> n <lb/> (1 − w)  r <lb/> where <lb/> K  n,g,r  = <lb/> θ|=n <lb/>l(θ)=r−2(g−1) <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k  τ  θ1  τ  θ2  . . . λ  k   g <lb/> and k = <lb/> i  (1−i)θ  i  +3g −3. Thus K  n,g,r  can be computed by Faber&apos;s program [Fb]. <lb/>The remaining term is obtained by Lagrange inversion as <lb/> x <lb/> d <lb/> w <lb/> n <lb/> (1 − w)  r  = <lb/>1 <lb/> d <lb/> µ <lb/> d−1 <lb/> nµ <lb/> n−1 <lb/> (1 − µ)  r  + <lb/> rµ <lb/> n <lb/> (1 − µ)  r+1 <lb/> e <lb/> dµ <lb/> = <lb/> d−n  <lb/> i=0 <lb/> r + i − 1 <lb/> r − 1 <lb/> n d <lb/> d−n−i−1 <lb/> (d − n − i)! <lb/> + <lb/> d−n−1  <lb/> i=0 <lb/> r + i <lb/>r <lb/> r d <lb/> d−n−i−2 <lb/> (d − n − i − 1)! <lb/> . <lb/> For example, for <lb/> H  3  (x), by Lagrange inversion, <lb/> H <lb/> 3 <lb/>(1  d  ) <lb/> (2d + 4)! <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>1008 <lb/> A  4  (d) − <lb/> 113 <lb/>10080 <lb/> A  5  (d) + <lb/>2383 <lb/>51840 <lb/> A  6  (d) − <lb/> 16759 <lb/>181440 <lb/> A  7  (d) <lb/>+ <lb/>227 <lb/>2304 <lb/> A  8  (d) − <lb/> 557 <lb/>10368 <lb/> A  9  (d) + <lb/>245 <lb/>20736 <lb/> A  10  (d) <lb/>(27) <lb/>where <lb/> A  k  (d) = <lb/> k <lb/>d <lb/> d−1  <lb/> r=0 <lb/> k + r <lb/>k <lb/> d <lb/> d−r−1 <lb/> (d − r − 1)! <lb/> . <lb/> This can be rewritten as <lb/> H <lb/> 3 <lb/>(1  d  )  = <lb/>(2d + 4)! <lb/>2  5  3  3  9! <lb/> d−1  <lb/> r=0 <lb/> d <lb/> d−r−2 <lb/> (d − r − 1)! <lb/> r + 4 <lb/>5 <lb/> (r + 1) <lb/> · <lb/> 1225 r <lb/> 4  + 3770 r <lb/> 3  + 35 r <lb/> 2  − 2822 r + 1680 <lb/> . <lb/> It is clear that in general the simple Hurwitz numbers have the form <lb/> H <lb/> g <lb/> (1  d  ) <lb/> = (2d + 2g − 2)! <lb/> d−1  <lb/> r=0 <lb/> d <lb/> d−r−2 <lb/> (d − r − 1)! <lb/> P  g  (d − r − 1) <lb/>where P  g  (r) is a polynomial in r of degree 5g − 5. <lb/></body>
