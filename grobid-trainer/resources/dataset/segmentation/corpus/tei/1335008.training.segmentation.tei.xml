One of the tools for constraining the properties of some particles predicted by the <lb/>different non-standard physical theories is the study of the evolutive properties of stars. The <lb/>reason is that the hot and dense interior of stars is a powerful source of low-mass weakly-<lb/>interacting particles that freely escape to the space. Therefore, these particles constitute a <lb/>sink of energy that modifies the evolutionary timescales of stars, thus opening the door to <lb/>constraint the properties of such hypothetical particles. Several stellar objects have been <lb/>used up to now to this regard. Among these are the Sun, supernovae, red giants and AGB <lb/>stars. However, the uncertainties and model dependences recommend the use of different <lb/>astrophysical techniques to constrain or verify these new theories. Here we show that, for <lb/>several reasons being the most outstanding one the their simplicity, white dwarfs can be used <lb/>as excellent laboratories for testing new physics. In this paper we apply them to constrain <lb/>the mass of the axions. <lb/> Key words.  Stars: white dwarfs — stars: oscillations — particles: axions <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> Several non-standard theories predict the ex-<lb/>istence of exotic particles. Since very often <lb/>there are not laboratory experiments in the rel-<lb/>evant energy range able to obtain empirical ev-<lb/>idences of their existence or properties, it is <lb/>necessary to use stars to obtain information <lb/>about them Raffelt (1996). The general pro-<lb/>cedure adopted in this case consists in com-<lb/>paring the observed properties of selected stars <lb/>with well measured properties (or of a clus-<lb/> Send offprint requests to: J. Isern <lb/> ter of stars) with the predictions of theoreti-<lb/>cal stellar models obtained under different as-<lb/>sumptions about the underlying microphysics. <lb/>In particular, the hot and dense interior of stars <lb/>is a powerful source of low-mass weakly in-<lb/>teracting particles that freely escape to space. <lb/>These hypothetical particles constitute a sink <lb/>of energy that modifies the lifetimes of stars at <lb/>the different evolutionary stages, thus allowing <lb/>a comparison with the observed lifetimes. <lb/>However, the uncertainties and model de-<lb/>pendences recommend the use of different as-<lb/>trophysical techniques to constrain or verify <lb/></body>

			<body> these theories. In this sense, white dwarfs <lb/>can be excellent laboratories for testing new <lb/>physics since: i) Their evolution is just a simple <lb/>process of cooling, ii) The basic physical ingre-<lb/>dients necessary to predict their evolution are <lb/>well identified, although not necessarily well <lb/>understood, and iii) There is an impressively <lb/>solid observational background to check the <lb/>different theories. <lb/> 2. Modelling the effects on white <lb/>dwarfs <lb/> Since the core of white dwarfs is completely <lb/>degenerate these stars cannot obtain energy <lb/>from nuclear reactions and their evolution is <lb/>just a gravothermal process of contraction and <lb/>cooling that can be roughly described as: <lb/> L  ph  + L  ν  + L  es  = − <lb/> d(E + Ω) <lb/> dt <lb/> (1) <lb/>where E is the total internal energy, Ω is the to-<lb/>tal gravitational energy, and L  ph , L  ν  and L  es are <lb/>the photon, neutrino and extra sink luminosi-<lb/>ties, respectively. Therefore, if an additional <lb/>cooling source were present, the characteristic <lb/>cooling time should decrease and the individ-<lb/>ual or collective properties of white dwarfs that <lb/>are sensitive to this time scale (the white dwarf <lb/>luminosity function and the period of oscilla-<lb/>tion of variable white dwarfs) are modified. <lb/> 2.1. The white dwarf luminosity function <lb/> We start by introducing the white luminosity <lb/>function, which is defined as the number of <lb/>white dwarfs of a given luminosity per unit of <lb/>magnitude interval: <lb/> n(l) ∝ <lb/>  M  s <lb/> M  i <lb/> Φ(M) Ψ(τ)τ  cool (l, M) dM <lb/> (2) <lb/>where <lb/> τ = T − t  cool (l, M) − t  PS (M) <lb/>(3) <lb/>and l is the logarithm of the luminosity in so-<lb/>lar units, M is the mass of the parent star (for <lb/>convenience all white dwarfs are labeled with <lb/>the mass of the main sequence progenitor), <lb/> t  cool is the cooling time down to luminosity l, <lb/> τ  cool  = dt/dM  bol is the characteristic cooling <lb/>time, M  s and M  i are the maximum and the min-<lb/>imum masses of the main sequence stars able <lb/>to produce a white dwarf of luminosity l, t  PS <lb/> is the lifetime of the progenitor of the white <lb/>dwarf, and T is the age of the population un-<lb/>der study. The remaining quantities, the initial <lb/>mass function, Φ(M), and the star formation <lb/>rate, Ψ(t), are not known a priori and depend on <lb/>the astronomical properties of the stellar pop-<lb/>ulation under study. Since the total density of <lb/>white dwarfs is not well known, the computed <lb/>luminosity function is normalized to the bin <lb/>with the smallest error bars in order to compare <lb/>theory with observations. <lb/>Since the characteristic cooling time does <lb/>not strongly depend on the mass of the white <lb/>dwarf, it is possible to write <lb/> n(l) ∝ τ  cool  <lb/> Φ(M)Ψ(τ)dM <lb/> (4) <lb/>If we restrict ourselves to bright white dwarfs <lb/>— namely, those with t  cool  T — Eq. (3) <lb/>can be satisfied for a wide range of masses of <lb/>the progenitor stars — that is, stars of different <lb/>masses born at very different times. Moreover, <lb/>the integral term becomes weakly dependent <lb/>on Ψ if the star formation rate is a smooth func-<lb/>tion of time. In conclusion, the integral can be <lb/>considered as roughly constant and, thus, can <lb/>be incorporated in the normalization constant, <lb/>and so the bright part of the luminosity func-<lb/>tion only depends on the characteristic cooling <lb/>time. Since the number density of white dwarfs <lb/>of each luminosity bin depends on the time that <lb/>each star takes to cross the interval, the number <lb/>density of stars of each bin changes as: <lb/> N = N  0 <lb/> L  0 <lb/> L  0  + L  1 <lb/> (5) <lb/>where L  0 is the luminosity of the star obtained <lb/>with standard physics and L  1 is the contribu-<lb/>tion of the non-standard terms. Therefore the <lb/>allowed values of L  1 are constrained by the ob-<lb/>servational uncertainties Isern et al. (2003). <lb/>Figure 1 displays the luminosity func-<lb/>tion obtained from the last SDSS release <lb/></body>

			<body> Fig. 1.  Luminosity function of white dwarfs obtained under different hypothesis. The observational values <lb/>(dots) were obtained from the data quoted by Harris et al. (2005). The solid line represents the computed <lb/>luminosity function obtained with standard physics. The dotted line is the luminosity function computed <lb/>assuming that axions have a mass irrealistically large just for illustrating purposes. The dashed line was <lb/>obtained assuming m  ax cos <lb/> 2  β = 10 meV and the dotted–dashed line assuming m  ax cos <lb/> 2  β = 4 meV. <lb/> Harris et al. (2005). The solid line was ob-<lb/>tained using the cooling sequences of Salaris <lb/>et al. (2000), the initial–final mass relation-<lb/>ship of Domínguez et al. (1999), a constant <lb/>star formation rate and an age of the disk of <lb/>10.5 Gyr. The cooling models assume a non-<lb/>homogeneous distribution of carbon and oxy-<lb/>gen in the core Salaris et al. (1997), a pure he-<lb/>lium layer of 10 <lb/> −2  M  *  and on top of it a pure <lb/>hydrogen layer of 10 <lb/> −4  M  *  , where M  *  is the <lb/>mass of the white dwarf. <lb/> 2.2. Pulsating white dwarfs <lb/> During their cooling, white dwarfs cross some <lb/>specific zones of the Hertzsprung-Russell dia-<lb/>gram where they become unstable and pulsate. <lb/>The multiperiodic character of the pulsations <lb/>and the size of the periods (100 s to 1000 s), <lb/>much larger than the period of radial pulsations <lb/>(∼ 10 s), indicate that white dwarfs are g-mode <lb/> pulsators (the restoring force is gravity). As the <lb/>variable white dwarf cools down, the oscilla-<lb/>tion period, P, changes as a consequence of the <lb/>changes in the mechanical structure. This secu-<lb/>lar drift can be approximated by Winget et al. <lb/>(1983): <lb/>˙ <lb/> P <lb/>P <lb/> −a <lb/> ˙ <lb/> T <lb/>T <lb/> + b <lb/> ˙ <lb/> R <lb/>R <lb/> (6) <lb/></body>

			<body> where a and b are positive constants of the or-<lb/>der of unity. The first term of the right hand <lb/>side reflects the fact that as the star cools down <lb/>the degree of degeneracy increases, the Brunt-<lb/>Väisälä frequency decreases and, as a con-<lb/>sequence, the oscillation period of stars in-<lb/>creases. At the same time, the residual gravita-<lb/>tional contraction, that is always present, tends <lb/>to decrease the oscillation period. The later ef-<lb/>fect is accounted for by the last term in Eq. (6). <lb/>There are three types of variable white <lb/>dwarfs, the DOV, the DBV and the DAV white <lb/>dwarfs. In the case of the hottest ones, the <lb/>DOV, the gravitational contraction is still sig-<lb/>nificant and the second term in Eq. (6) is not <lb/>negligible. In fact, for these stars ˙ <lb/> P can be pos-<lb/>itive or negative depending of the character of <lb/>the oscillation mode. If the mode is dominated <lb/>by the deep regions of the star, ˙ <lb/> P is positive. If <lb/>the mode is dominated by the outer layers, ˙ <lb/> P is <lb/>negative Kawaler &amp; Bradley (1994). The sec-<lb/>ular drift of the prototype of these kind of stars <lb/>is ˙ <lb/> P = (13.07 ± 0.3) × 10 <lb/> −11  s/s for the 516 s <lb/>pulsation period. However, the uncertainties in <lb/>the modelling of their interior have prevented <lb/>the obtaining reliable conclusions (Winget et <lb/>al. 1985; Costa et al. 1999). <lb/>The DBV stars are characterized by the <lb/>lack of the hydrogen layer in their envelopes <lb/>and by effective temperatures of the order of <lb/> T  eff  ∼ 25, 000 K. Since they are cooler than <lb/>DOV white dwarfs, the radial term is negli-<lb/>gible and ˙ <lb/> P is always positive. The expected <lb/>drift ranges from ˙ <lb/> P ∼ 10 <lb/> −13  to 10 <lb/> −14  s/s <lb/>Córsico &amp; Althaus (2004), but it has not been <lb/>yet measured with enough accuracy. <lb/>The DAV white dwarfs, or ZZ Ceti stars, <lb/>are characterized by the presence of a very thin <lb/>atmospheric layer made of pure hydrogen and <lb/>by effective temperatures ranging from T  eff  ∼ <lb/> 12, 000 to 15, 000 K. As in the case of DBV <lb/>stars, they are so cool that the radial term is <lb/>negligible and ˙ <lb/> P is always positive. The drift <lb/>has been measured for the P = 215.2 s mode of <lb/>G117–B15A (Kepler et al. 2005, 2000), ˙ <lb/> P = <lb/> (3.57 ± 0.82) × 10 <lb/> −15  s/s, and an upper bound <lb/>has been obtained for the P = 213, 13 s mode <lb/>in the case of R 548, ˙ <lb/> P ≤ (5.5 ± 1.9) × 10 <lb/> −15  s/s <lb/>(Mukadam et al. 2003). <lb/>The seismological analysis of G117–B15A <lb/>indicates that the best fit is obtained for <lb/> M  *  = 0.55 M   , log M  He  /M  *  = −2 and <lb/>log M  H  /M  *  = −4.04 Córsico et al. (2001), <lb/>that gives a cooling rate of ˙ <lb/> P = 3.9 × 10 <lb/> −15 <lb/> s/s, very similar to the recently found obser-<lb/>vational value Kepler et al. (2005). A similar <lb/>analysis Bisschoff-Kim et al. (2007) has found <lb/>two possible fits to the seismological data, one <lb/>with a hydrogen layer of 6.3 × 10 <lb/> −7  M  *  and an-<lb/>other one with 4 × 10 <lb/> −8  M  *  and period drifts of <lb/>1.92 × 10 <lb/> −15  s/s and 2.98 × 10 <lb/> −15  s/s, respec-<lb/>tively. It is important to notice here that in the <lb/>first analysis the predicted cooling rate is larger <lb/>than the observed one, while in the second <lb/>analysis the calculated rates are smaller than <lb/>the observed ones. This means that in the first <lb/>case there is no room for any additional cool-<lb/>ing while in the second one there is room for <lb/>an extra sink of energy. In the case of R 548 the <lb/>predicted change of period is ˙ <lb/> P = 2.91 × 10 <lb/> −15 <lb/> s/s Bisschoff-Kim et al. (2007), in agreement <lb/>with the observational bound. <lb/>This secular drift can be used to test the <lb/>predicted cooling rate or, if the models are re-<lb/>liable enough, to test any new physical effect <lb/>able to change the pulsating period of these <lb/>stars.The observed rate of change of the pul-<lb/>sation period, ˙ <lb/> P  obs and the calculated rate of <lb/>change are related by Isern et al. (2003,?): <lb/> L  0  + L  1 <lb/> L  0 <lb/> = <lb/> ˙ <lb/> P  obs <lb/> ˙ <lb/> P  mod <lb/> (7) <lb/>where L  1 is the extra emission term included <lb/>in the models and L  0 is the luminosity pre-<lb/>dicted by the models incorporating only stan-<lb/>dard physics. <lb/>These methods have been succesfully <lb/>applied to constrain the mass of the axions <lb/>Isern et al. (2003); Córsico et al. (2001), the <lb/>possible changes of the gravitational con-<lb/>stant García–Berro et al. (1995); Isern et al. <lb/>(2003); Benvenuto et al.

			<body> 3. The case of axions <lb/> One of the ways to solve the strong CP prob-<lb/>lem of QCD consists in the introduction of an <lb/> &quot; ad hoc &quot; new symmetry in the Lagrangian of <lb/>the fundamental interaction Peccei &amp; Quinn <lb/>(1977). The spontaneous breaking of this sym-<lb/>metry gives raise to the axions. The two most <lb/>simple models of axions are the KVSZ model <lb/>Kim (1979); Shifman et al. (1980) and the <lb/>DFSZ Zhimitskii (1980); Dine et al. (1981). <lb/>In the KVSZ model, axions couple to hadrons <lb/>and photons whereas in the DFSZ model, ax-<lb/>ions also couple to charged leptons. The cou-<lb/>pling strengths depend on the specific im-<lb/>plementation of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism <lb/>through a set of dimensionless coupling con-<lb/>stants. Both models do not set any constraint <lb/>on the mass of the axion which has to be ob-<lb/>tained from experimental measures or from ob-<lb/>servational tests. The axion mass is m  ax  = <lb/> 0.62 eV(10 <lb/> 7 GeV/ f  α  ), where f  α  is the Peccei-<lb/>Quinn scale and the axion coupling with mat-<lb/>ter is proportional to f <lb/> −1 <lb/> α  . Therefore, axions can <lb/>interact with photons through the Primakov <lb/>conversion of photons into axions and vicev-<lb/>ersa under the influence of an electromag-<lb/>netic field, or with nucleons or with electrons <lb/>(in the DFSZ case) through the Compton and <lb/>bremsstrahlung processes. <lb/>The most restrictive constraints to the mass <lb/>of axions come from astrophysical and cosmo-<lb/>logical arguments — see Raffelt (2006) for a <lb/>recent review. The requirements for not over-<lb/>closing the Universe imply that m  ax  &gt; 6 × 10 <lb/> −6 <lb/> eV. The lack of observations of photons pro-<lb/>duced by the decay of axions Massó &amp; Toldra <lb/>(1997), together with the hot dark matter limit <lb/>introduces an upper bound of m  ax  &lt; 1 eV. <lb/>Stars in globular clusters provide an additional <lb/> m  ax  &lt; 0.01 eV, while the helium ignition argu-<lb/>ment provides an additional constraint to the <lb/>DFASZ model m  ax cos <lb/> 2  β &lt; 9 meV, where <lb/>cos <lb/> 2  β is a fre parameter like m  ax that appears <lb/>in tghe strength of the coupling of axions with <lb/>electrons given by <lb/> g  ae  = 2.83 × 10 <lb/> −11  m  ax cos <lb/> 2  β <lb/> (8) <lb/>Despite that the requirements imposed by the <lb/>duration of neutrino signal of SN1987A are <lb/>still moot, a new safe limit of m  ax &lt; <lb/> ∼ 10 meV <lb/>can be adopted. Finally, the CAST experiment <lb/>Ziontas et al. (2005) has established a gen-<lb/>eral bound on the strength of the axion-photon <lb/>interaction, g  αγγ  ≤ 1.16 × 10 <lb/> −10  GeV <lb/> −1  for <lb/> m  ax &lt; <lb/> ∼ 0.02 eV, where g  αγγ  ∝ m  ax and the con-<lb/>stant of proportionality depends on the adopted <lb/>model. <lb/>In the case of relatively cold white <lb/>dwarfs, the dominat process of axion emis-<lb/>sion is bremsstrahlung. The emisiion rate is <lb/>Nakagawa et al. (1988): <lb/>  ax  = 1.08 × 10 <lb/> 23  α <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/> A <lb/>T <lb/> 4 <lb/>7  F(Γ) <lb/> (9) <lb/>where α = g <lb/> 2 <lb/>ae  /4π, F takes into account the <lb/>plasma effects and Γ is the Coulomb parameter. <lb/>The inclusion of axions does not change <lb/>the period of pulsation of the white dwarf, <lb/>but strongly accelerates its secular variation <lb/>Córsico et al. (2001) and, consequently, puts <lb/>a strong constrain to the mass of the axion. <lb/>Córsico et al. (2001) obtained m  ax cos <lb/> 2  β &lt; <lb/> ∼ 4 <lb/>meV, although strictly speaking their results <lb/>were suggesting to rule out the interaction of <lb/>the axions with the electrons. The analysis of <lb/>Bischoff-Kim et al. (2007) indicates that ax-<lb/>ions can represent an additional cooling source <lb/>to white dwarfs and provide a less restrictive <lb/>bound of 13 to 26 meV, depending on the <lb/>adopted mass for the hydrogen layer. The weak <lb/>point of the seismological analysis is that the <lb/>drift period has only been measured in one case <lb/>and both, observations and models, are not pre-<lb/>cise enough to rule out the interaction of elec-<lb/>trons with axions nor to determine the mass of <lb/>the axion. <lb/>The luminosity function could provide in a <lb/>next future additional insight. Figure 1 displays <lb/>the luminosity functions obtained when the ax-<lb/>ion emission is included. Since  ax  ∝ T <lb/> 4 , the <lb/>evolution of hot white dwarfs is very rapid and <lb/>are quickly transfered from the bright to the <lb/>dim regios of the luminosity function where <lb/>they accumulate — see Eq. (5). The dotted <lb/>line in Fig. 1 clearly displays such a behav-<lb/>ior. In this case, however, the mass of the ax-<lb/>ion was taken irrealistically large just for illus-<lb/>trative purposes. When the mass of the axion <lb/></body>

			<body> decreases, the luminosity function approaches <lb/>to the nominal value. Interestingly, the agree-<lb/>ment with the observed luminosity function <lb/>improves when axions with a moderate mass, <lb/> m  ax  ∼ 4 meV, are included, suggesting that an <lb/>additional sink of energy is necessary to fit the <lb/>observations. <lb/> 4. Conclusions <lb/> Because of their simplicity, white dwarfs can <lb/>be considered excellent complementary lab-<lb/>oratories for testing new physics. We have <lb/>shown how the high precision luminosity func-<lb/>tions that are progressively becoming available <lb/>and the pulsation drift of degenerate variables <lb/>can be used to provide independent insights on <lb/>any new particle physics mechanism able to <lb/>perturbate the cooling rate of such stars. In par-<lb/>ticular, we have shown that, when this method <lb/>is applied to axions, it is possible to obtain a <lb/>strong constraint to their ability to interact with <lb/>electrons. The most recent analysis of the pul-<lb/>sation period drift Bisschoff-Kim et al. (2007) <lb/>of G117-B15A and the new luminosity func-<lb/>tions suggest that there is still room for the ex-<lb/>istence of axions with masses m  ax  ∼ 5 meV. <lb/>If this is ultimately proved to be true, axions <lb/>could play a crucial role in the late stages of <lb/>stellar evolution. <lb/></body>
