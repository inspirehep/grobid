Rev. 71 38–41). Snyder space predicts a modified commutation <lb/>algebra for position and momentum operators. The method described in <lb/>this paper introduces operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations <lb/>and relates them to the position and momentum operators of Snyder space, <lb/>effectively mapping a problem in Snyder space into a similar problem in <lb/>standard quantum mechanics. The method is applied to the simple harmonic <lb/>oscillator (SHO) in one and two dimensions as well as to the one-dimensional <lb/>infinite square well. The energy spectra are calculated perturbatively for the <lb/>SHO. We also find an exact spectrum for the one-dimensional infinite square <lb/>well potential. These results are shown to agree with similar results found <lb/>elsewhere in the literature. <lb/>PACS numbers: 03.65.−w, 03.65.Fd <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> Quantum mechanics is characterized by the appearance of noncommuting operators. In <lb/>particular, the canonical commutation relations <lb/>[x  i  , p j  ] = i¯ hδ ij <lb/> (1) <lb/>[x  i , x j  ] = 0 <lb/>( 2 ) <lb/>[p  i , p j  ] = 0, <lb/>(3) <lb/>are an essential feature of quantum mechanics, from which all the properties of position and <lb/>momentum can be derived [1]. In considering physical theories beyond standard quantum <lb/>mechanics, it is therefore natural to consider modifications to the canonical commutation <lb/>relations. Usually, these modifications manifest themselves in theories of quantum gravity. <lb/></body>

			<body> For example, a low energy limit of string theory predicts the deformation of the Heisenberg <lb/>algebra given by <lb/>[x  i  , p j  ] = i¯ hδ ij <lb/> (4) <lb/>[x  i , x j  ] = iθ  ij <lb/> (5) <lb/>[p  i , p j  ] = 0, <lb/>(6) <lb/>where θ ij  is a real, antisymmetric matrix that characterizes the noncommutativity among <lb/>spatial coordinates [2, 3]. <lb/>Historically, the first formulation of quantum mechanics on a noncommutative manifold, <lb/>known as Snyder space, was proposed by Hartland Snyder in 1947 [4, 5]. Snyder introduced <lb/>a fundamental length a with the hope of removing divergence problems from quantum field <lb/>theory. A natural consequence of this introduction is the modification of the canonical <lb/>commutation relations to <lb/>[x  i , p j  ] = i¯ h(δ ij  + αp i p j ) <lb/> (7) <lb/>[x  i , x j  ] = i¯ hα ij k L k <lb/> (8) <lb/>[p  i , p j  ] = 0, <lb/>(9) <lb/>where α = a <lb/> 2  /¯ h <lb/> 2 and L k  is the angular momentum which is defined in the usual way: <lb/> L k  =  ij k x i p j . <lb/> (10) <lb/>While the divergences of quantum field theory were ultimately dealt with by renormalization, <lb/>the concept of quantized spacetime remains current as a possible approach when quantizing <lb/>gravity. Besides its historical significance, Snyder space stands out as a particular quantization <lb/>of space that preserves Lorentz invariance. <lb/>Commutation relations very similar to those proposed by Snyder were derived <lb/>independently by Kempf et al [6, 7], and are known as the minimal length uncertainty <lb/>relations. This commutation algebra was motivated by possible application to the description of <lb/>nonpointlike particles, such as strings. The remarkable similarity between the minimal length <lb/>uncertainty relations and the Snyder commutation relations further justifies reconsidering the <lb/>consequences of Snyder&apos;s formulations. <lb/>Another modified commutation algebra is known as dynamical quantization, which was <lb/>proposed in the early 1980s as an effective method of describing high-energy interactions. <lb/>In the case of the one-dimensional free particle, the commutation algebra of dynamical <lb/>quantization is the same as that of Snyder space [8, 9]. Further connections with other <lb/>approaches to quantum gravity, such as noncommutative quantum mechanics, are explored in <lb/>[10]. The fact that Snyder space is Lorentz invariant also singles it out among noncommutative <lb/>theories [11]. <lb/>In this paper, we discuss a method for approaching problems in Snyder space. The <lb/>method is analogous to an approach for solving problems in the noncommutative geometry of <lb/>equations (4)–(6) [3]. The idea is to relate operators satisfying the canonical commutations <lb/>relations to the physical operators satisfying a modified commutation algebra. Effectively, this <lb/>maps problems from Snyder space to analogous problems in standard quantum mechanics. <lb/>This technique is useful because of the existence of numerous techniques for solving systems in <lb/>standard quantum mechanics. In particular, we will see that the effects of quantized spacetime <lb/>can be represented as a small additional term in the Hamiltonian of the analogous system in <lb/>quantum mechanics, so that the perturbation theory is likely to be useful. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2. Operator transformations <lb/> The modified (noncanonical) commutation relations presented in equations (7)–(9) are restated <lb/>as relations between the physical Snyder operators x  S  and p S  , <lb/>[x  Si , p Sj  ] = i¯ h(δ ij  + αp Si p Sj ) <lb/> (11) <lb/>[x  Si , x Sj  ] = i¯ hα ij k L Sk <lb/> (12) <lb/>[p  Si , p Sj  ] = 0, <lb/>(13) <lb/>where the subscript S, not an index, refers to &apos;Snyder&apos;. Since x Si  and p Si  represent physical <lb/>observables in Snyder space, they are assumed to be Hermitian. <lb/>On the other hand, we denote operators that satisfy the canonical commutation relations <lb/>without the S subscript, <lb/>[x  i , p j  ] = i¯ hδ ij <lb/> (14) <lb/>[x  i , x j  ] = 0 <lb/>(15) <lb/>[p  i , p j  ] = 0. <lb/>(16) <lb/>Note that these commutation relations can be recovered from those in equations (11)–(13) in <lb/>the limit that α approaches 0. Since x i  and p i  do not represent physical variables, they are not <lb/>necessarily Hermitian. However, since our goal is to map problems into standard quantum <lb/>mechanics by means of these operators, we add the requirement that they be Hermitian as <lb/>well. <lb/>We wish to find an expression for x S  and p S  in terms of operators satisfying the canonical <lb/>commutation relations, x and p. We refer to such a relation as an operator transformation, <lb/>since it allows us to effectively &apos;transform&apos; operator expressions from Snyder space into an <lb/>analogous expression in standard quantum mechanics. <lb/>First, we consider the one-dimensional case. Using the result on the commutator of two <lb/>functions of two operators in [12], the commutation relation <lb/>[x  S , p S  ] = i¯ h <lb/> 1 + αp <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> (17) <lb/>can be written as the differential equation <lb/> ∞ <lb/> k=1 <lb/> (−i¯ h) <lb/> k <lb/> k! <lb/> ∂ <lb/> k p S <lb/> ∂x k <lb/> ∂ <lb/> k x S <lb/> ∂p k  − <lb/> ∂ <lb/> k x S <lb/> ∂x k <lb/> ∂ <lb/> k p S <lb/> ∂p k <lb/> = i¯ h <lb/> 1 + αp <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> , <lb/> (18) <lb/>where the operators x S  and p S  are functions of the operators x and p. The use of equation (18) <lb/>automatically imposes the canonical behaviour of x and p. Since equation (18) is a single <lb/>equation for two unknowns, there is some freedom in our choice of x S  and p S  . By making a <lb/>judicious choice for one of x S  or p S  , equation (18) can be greatly simplified. <lb/>If we make the identification <lb/> p S  = p, <lb/> (19) <lb/>then equation (18) becomes <lb/> (i¯ h) <lb/>∂x S <lb/> ∂x <lb/> = i¯ h(1 + αp <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> (20) <lb/>which has the solution <lb/> x S  = (1 + αp <lb/> 2  )x + f (p) <lb/> (21) <lb/></body>

			<body> where f (p) is an arbitrary function of p that can be determined by the hermiticity requirement <lb/>on x S  . In particular, x <lb/>  † <lb/> S  = x S  gives <lb/> x(1 + αp <lb/> 2  ) + f (p) <lb/>  † <lb/> = (1 + αp <lb/> 2  )x + f (p) <lb/> (22) <lb/>or equivalently <lb/> f (p) − f (p) <lb/>  † <lb/> = α(xp <lb/> 2 <lb/> − p <lb/> 2  x) = 2i¯ hαp, <lb/> (23) <lb/>where we have assumed that x and p are Hermitian. This can be solved by assuming that f (p) <lb/> is anti-Hermitian, f (p) = i¯ hαp. Putting it all together, we have <lb/> x S  = (1 + αp <lb/> 2  )x + i¯ hαp = x + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> α(p <lb/> 2  x + xp <lb/> 2  ) = x + αpxp <lb/>p S  = p. <lb/> (24) <lb/>Similarly, if we make the identification <lb/> x S  = x <lb/> (25) <lb/>then equation (18) becomes <lb/>i¯ h <lb/>∂p S <lb/> ∂p <lb/> = i¯ h <lb/> 1 + αp <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> . <lb/> (26) <lb/>This differential equation is satisfied by p S  = <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/> tan( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp). The whole transformation is <lb/>then <lb/> x S  = x <lb/>p S  = <lb/> tan( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp) <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/>. <lb/> (27) <lb/>In order for the transformation to be invertible, we restrict the range of p, such that −π/2 <lb/> √ <lb/> αp  π/2. Using this transformation, the quantization effects are manifest by truncating <lb/>the range of p to a finite interval. This issue is further discussed in the appendix. Analogously, <lb/>in standard quantum mechanics, truncating the range of the position operator by means of the <lb/>infinite square well results in a quantization of the energy and the momentum [10]. <lb/>Following a similar approach in two dimensions, we obtain a transformation, leaving <lb/>momentum unaffected <lb/> p Sx  = p x <lb/> p Sy  = p y <lb/> x S  = x + α <lb/> p x xp x  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> p x (yp y  + p y y) <lb/> y S  = y + α <lb/> p y yp y  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> p y (xp x  + p x x) <lb/> (28) <lb/>and transformations leaving just one of the coordinates unaffected <lb/> x S  = x <lb/>p Sx  = <lb/> tan( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp x ) <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/>y S  = −y cos( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp x ) + cot( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp y ) sin( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp x )x <lb/>p Sy  = <lb/> cot( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp y ) <lb/> √ <lb/> α cos( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp x ) <lb/>, <lb/> (29) <lb/>where a similar transformation is found by letting y S  = y with appropriate expressions for the <lb/>other operators. <lb/></body>

			<body> In the one-dimensional case we found that the commutation algebra provided one equation <lb/>to be satisfied by two operators, which allowed us to arbitrarily specify one of the operators. <lb/>In d dimensions, there are 2d operators that must satisfy <lb/>  2d <lb/>2 <lb/> equations. Therefore, in higher <lb/>dimensions there are more equations than unknowns and the system is overdetermined. One <lb/>can always find at least one transformation in arbitrary dimensions. It is given by <lb/> x  Si  = x i  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> αp i (x j p j  + p j x j ) <lb/> (30) <lb/> p Si  = p i , <lb/> (31) <lb/>where we note the use of the Einstein summation convention. One can show that this <lb/>transformation satisfies the commutation algebra in arbitrary dimensions. <lb/>The applicability of this technique can be found by considering the functional form of a <lb/>Hamiltonian H under a transformation described in this section. All of the transformations <lb/>described in this section can be written as <lb/> x S  = = <lb/> x + <lb/> X(α, <lb/> x, <lb/> p) <lb/> (32) <lb/> p S  = = <lb/> p + <lb/> P (α, <lb/> x, <lb/> p), <lb/> (33) <lb/>where <lb/> X and <lb/> P depend on the choice of transformation and vanish in the limit that α → 0. <lb/>Given such a transformation, the Hamiltonian becomes <lb/> H ( x S , <lb/> p S ) = H ( x + <lb/> X(α, <lb/> x, <lb/> p), <lb/> p + <lb/> P (α, <lb/> x, <lb/> p)). <lb/> (34) <lb/>If the Hamiltonian is an analytic function of its arguments it can be expanded as a Taylor series <lb/>as <lb/> H ( x S , <lb/> p S ) = H ( x, <lb/> p) + αV  1  ( <lb/> x, <lb/> p) + α <lb/> 2  V  2  ( <lb/> x, <lb/> p) + · · · , <lb/> (35) <lb/>which is a Hamiltonian of the same system in standard quantum mechanics with small <lb/>correction terms. The system can then be tackled either exactly or through techniques of <lb/>perturbation theory. <lb/> 3. Application to the simple harmonic oscillator <lb/> As an application of the transformations presented in section 2, we study the simple harmonic <lb/>oscillator in Snyder space. In one dimension, using the transformation of equation (24) the <lb/>Hamiltonian is <lb/> H = <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> 2m <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> mω <lb/> 2  x <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> (36) <lb/> = <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2m <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> mω <lb/> 2  x <lb/> 2 + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> αmω <lb/> 2  (2x <lb/> 2  p <lb/> 2 <lb/> − 4i¯ hxp − ¯ <lb/> h <lb/> 2  ) + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> α <lb/> 2  mω <lb/> 2  (x <lb/> 2  p <lb/> 4 <lb/> − 4i¯ hxp <lb/> 3 <lb/> − 2¯ h <lb/> 2  p <lb/> 2  ). <lb/> (37) <lb/>This is clearly a simple harmonic oscillator with small perturbation terms proportional <lb/>to α and α <lb/> 2 . Furthermore, the expression for the Hamiltonian does not include references to <lb/>the Snyder space operators, although there are terms that include the fundamental length, as <lb/>expected. Since the operators x and p are Hermitian, the Hamiltonian in equation (37) is a <lb/>valid Hamiltonian in standard quantum mechanics and standard solution techniques apply. <lb/></body>

They are the only ones contributing <lb/>in first-order perturbation. Terms that are not self-adjoint are then listed in increasing powers <lb/>of the ladder operators. Inspection reveals that this Hamiltonian is self-adjoint. <lb/>The Hamiltonian given above, expressed both in terms of position and momentum or in <lb/>terms of raising and lowering operators, is exact. No approximations have been made to this <lb/>point. By studying the form of equation (37), we can see that the effect of quantizing spacetime <lb/>is to introduce a perturbation that includes terms containing position and momentum. This <lb/>can be interpreted as a velocity-dependent and position-dependent force. <lb/>In one dimension, it may be more useful to apply the transformation given in equation (27). <lb/>In this case, for any velocity-independent potential, the result of the transformation will be to <lb/>modify the kinetic energy T to <lb/> T = <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> 2m <lb/> = <lb/> α <lb/> 2m <lb/>tan <lb/> 2 <lb/> p <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/> , <lb/> (41) <lb/>while leaving the potential energy term V unchanged <lb/> V (x S ) = V (x). <lb/> (42) <lb/>In this case, the perturbation is always a velocity-dependent and position-independent <lb/>perturbation. <lb/>Once an exact form of the Hamiltonian is found, it can be solved by applying techniques <lb/>from perturbation theory. Using perturbation theory formulae worked out to fourth-order in α <lb/> [10, 13], the corrected energy spectrum of equation (40) is <lb/> E n  = ¯ <lb/> hω <lb/> n + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> 1 + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>128 <lb/> β <lb/> 4 <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> β(2n <lb/> 2 + 2n + 1) <lb/> , <lb/> (43) <lb/>where β = αmω¯ h is the dimensionless perturbation expansion parameter. Repeating the <lb/>procedure using the transformation given in equation (27) instead of equation (24) results in <lb/>the same energy spectrum. <lb/>The same process can be applied to the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator; <lb/>however, the situation is complicated by the fact that the energy spectrum of the two-<lb/>dimensional harmonic oscillator is degenerate. The angular momentum operator, L Sz  , can be <lb/></body>

			<body> The second-order perturbation corrected energy values are given by <lb/> E  n,l  = ¯ <lb/> hω <lb/> n + 1 + <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> ((n + 1) <lb/> 2 <lb/> − l <lb/> 2  ) + <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> 8 <lb/> (n + 1) <lb/> , <lb/> (50) <lb/>where l is the angular momentum quantum number, which takes on integer values between n <lb/> and −n in intervals of 2. Repeating the proceduring using the transformation in equation (29) <lb/>results in the same energy spectrum. <lb/>This analysis represents a proof of principle that the method of operator transformations <lb/>can be applied to find energy spectra in Snyder space. The simple harmonic oscillator was <lb/>chosen because it has the advantage that it has an exact solution in standard quantum mechanics. <lb/>In particular, the solution can be found by algebraic methods, so it is relatively straightforward <lb/>to apply methods from perturbation theory. Even in this case, the perturbation terms in the <lb/>Snyder simple harmonic oscillator are relatively complicated. We evaluated the perturbation <lb/>spectra by constructing algorithms in Maple and applying them to the specified correction <lb/>terms [10]. For more complex systems, it is reasonable to expect that the perturbation terms <lb/>could be more complicated. However, they can be constructed in principle and, although the <lb/>calculations may be more involved, evaluated by application of the algorithms. <lb/> 4. Application to the infinite square well <lb/> As another application of the transformations presented in section 2, we study the particle in <lb/>a one-dimensional infinite square well in Snyder space. The Hamiltonian is <lb/> H = <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> S <lb/> 2m <lb/>+ V (x S ), <lb/> (51) <lb/>where V (x S ) = 0 for 0  x S  L and infinite elsewhere. <lb/>In order to apply the techniques demonstrated in the previous section, we cannot use the <lb/>transformation in equation (24). If we did apply that transformation, our next step would create <lb/>a perturbation series in α; however, since the potential energy function is not analytic, no such <lb/>series exists for this transformation. Therefore, we choose the transformation in equation (27) <lb/>as a tool for analysing this system. In this case, the Hamiltonian becomes <lb/> H = <lb/> tan <lb/> 2  ( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp) <lb/> 2mα <lb/> = <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2m <lb/>+ α <lb/>p <lb/> 4 <lb/> 3m <lb/>+ · · · . <lb/> (52) <lb/>Using this transformation, only even powers of p appear. Therefore, this Hamiltonian has <lb/>common eigenstates with H  0  = p <lb/> 2  /2m. Hence, we can sum the perturbation series exactly <lb/>by noting that <lb/> H = <lb/> tan <lb/> 2  ( <lb/> √ <lb/> 2mαH 0  ) <lb/> 2mα <lb/> . <lb/> (53) <lb/>Therefore, the energy eigenvalue spectrum is given by <lb/> E n  = <lb/> tan <lb/> 2  ( <lb/> √ <lb/> 2mαE 0n  ) <lb/> 2mα <lb/> , <lb/> (54) <lb/>where E  0n are the eigenvalues of the unperturbed infinite square well in standard quantum <lb/>mechanics. It is well known for a one-dimensional infinite square well that E  0n  = <lb/> n <lb/> 2 ¯ <lb/> h <lb/> 2  π <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2mL 2 . For <lb/>convenience, we introduce the dimensionless parameter λ <lb/>λ = <lb/> L <lb/>a <lb/> (55) <lb/></body>

			<body> where a is the fundamental length in Snyder space. Recalling that α = <lb/> a <lb/> 2 <lb/> ¯ <lb/> h <lb/> 2 , we find that the <lb/>energy spectrum in Snyder space is <lb/> E n  = <lb/> tan <lb/> 2  (nπ/λ) <lb/> 2mα <lb/> . <lb/> (56) <lb/>In section 2, it was shown that using the transformation of equation (27) requires one to <lb/>truncate the range of the operator p. We consider the inverse transformation <lb/> x = x S <lb/> p = <lb/> arctan( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp S ) + Nπ <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/>, <lb/> (57) <lb/>with N integer and we select N = 0. Therefore, the quantum number n in equation (56) <lb/>does not range over all positive integers in the Snyder space spectrum, but has the range <lb/> n = 1, 2, . . . , n  max where <lb/> n  max  = =λ/2, <lb/> (58) <lb/>where x denotes the largest integer less than x. Thus, the infinite square well has only a <lb/>finite number of energy levels, in contrast to the standard quantum mechanical result. <lb/> 5. Agreement with results in the literature <lb/> The simple harmonic oscillator in Snyder space has an exact solution. As mentioned in <lb/>section 1, the Snyder space commutation algebra is essentially the minimal length uncertainty <lb/>relations. The simple harmonic oscillator eigenvalue problem has been solved in arbitrary <lb/>dimensions with the minimal length uncertainty relations by Chang et al [14]. Their result <lb/>indicates that the exact energy spectrum of the Snyder space SHO in d dimensions is given by <lb/> E nl  = ¯ <lb/> hω <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> n + <lb/> d <lb/> 2 <lb/> 1 + <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> + <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> n + <lb/> d <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> − <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> l <lb/> 2 + <lb/> d <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/> + <lb/> βd <lb/> 4 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (59) <lb/>Expanding this result as a power series in β recovers the perturbative results derived in <lb/>section 3 of this paper. A more comprehensive discussion of the exact solution to the SHO in <lb/>Snyder space will be given elsewhere [15]. <lb/>The infinite square well is essentially a free particle constrained to move in a finite <lb/>region. As mentioned in section 2, the Snyder space commutation algebra is equivalent to the <lb/>dynamical quantization algebra of a free particle [8]. The energy spectrum of a particle in an <lb/>infinite rigid box has been solved using the commutation relations of dynamical quantization. <lb/>The results agree with the ones presented in section 4 of this paper [9]. <lb/> 6. Conclusions <lb/> This paper presents a proof of principle for the method of operator transformation as an <lb/>approach for solving energy eigenvalue problems in Snyder space. We have seen that there are <lb/>several transformations that preserve the Snyder space commutation algebra while relating it <lb/>to the canonical algebra of quantum mechanics. It is possible that there are others besides the <lb/>ones given in this paper, although they are likely to be more complicated. <lb/>We have applied the techniques of operator transformation to the simple harmonic <lb/>oscillator in one and two dimensions. The resulting Hamiltonian is also a simple harmonic <lb/>oscillator with perturbation terms proportional to powers of the fundamental length of Snyder <lb/></body>

			<body> space. The perturbation terms include factors of momentum, and, therefore, can be interpreted <lb/>as velocity-dependent forces. The spectrum is independent of the particular transformation <lb/>chosen. <lb/>Application of perturbation theory results in a modified energy spectrum. It is interesting <lb/>to note that the effects of introducing a minimal length modify the structure of the energy <lb/>spectrum. Chang et al have commented on the possible use of this modified structure as a <lb/>potential experimental verification of the minimal length hypothesis [14]. <lb/>We have also applied the technique to the one-dimensional infinite square well. We <lb/>noted that since the potential energy function is not analytic, not all transformations are <lb/>practical. We applied a single transformation and found that the resulting Hamiltonian had <lb/>common eigenstates with the Hamiltonian of standard quantum mechanics, which allowed us <lb/>to calculate the energy spectrum exactly. This system also resulted in a spectrum very different <lb/>from that of standard quantum mechanics, possessing only a finite number of energy levels. <lb/>The algebraic approach we have illustrated here is actually not only applicable to systems <lb/>in Snyder space, but also to virtually any modified commutation algebra that reduces to the <lb/>canonical commutation relations in an appropriate limit. <lb/>As further validation of this approach, we have seen that the operator transformation <lb/>method produces results that agree with results currently available in the literature but obtained <lb/>using different methods. <lb/> Appendix: Why the values of the momentum must be truncated <lb/> As we describe in section 2 in the one-dimensional case, there exists a transformation given <lb/>by <lb/> x  S  = x <lb/> (A.1) <lb/> p S  = <lb/> tan( <lb/> √ <lb/> αp) <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/>. <lb/> (A.2) <lb/>When using this transformation, it is also necessary to truncate the range of the operator p to <lb/>make the transformation invertible. <lb/>To fully understand the need for this restriction, one must look more closely at the nature <lb/>of Snyder space [4]. One-dimensional Snyder space is defined by operators acting on the <lb/>circle defined by <lb/> η <lb/> 2 <lb/> = η <lb/> 2 <lb/>1 + η <lb/> 2 <lb/>4  . <lb/> (A.3) <lb/>By making a change of variables to polar coordinates, with polar angle φ, the position and <lb/>momentum operators, x S  and p S  , as defined by Snyder are given by (recalling that α = a <lb/> 2  /¯ h <lb/> 2 ) <lb/> x s  = ia <lb/>d <lb/>dφ <lb/>(A.4) <lb/> p S  = <lb/> ¯ <lb/> h <lb/>a <lb/> tan(φ). <lb/>(A.5) <lb/>By equating <lb/> p = <lb/> φ <lb/> √ <lb/> α <lb/> (A.6) <lb/> x = i¯ h <lb/> d <lb/>dp <lb/>(A.7) <lb/>we recover the transformation in question. <lb/></body>

			<body> Snyder quantizes spacetime by imposing the eigenfunctions of the position operator to <lb/>be single-valued, i.e. to repeat its values as φ increases by 2π . Using this condition, one can <lb/>see that x S  has eigenvalues ma where m is any integer. As a matter of fact, for the projective <lb/>coordinates of this de Sitter space, it is the ratio η  4  /η  1 that really matters, corresponding to a <lb/>periodicity of π for observable phenomena. Likewise, we require that eigenfunctions of the <lb/>Hamiltonians that we consider be single-valued, or periodic functions of φ. <lb/> Using the relation between φ and p given above and the periodic requirement on φ, we <lb/>require the same periodic requirement on p. Because of this periodicity, all results can be <lb/>found by studying a single period and no information is lost restricting the variable to one <lb/>period, thus the truncation. <lb/>In connection with the infinite square well from section 4, we note that since the modified <lb/>Hamiltonian contains only even powers of the momentum, it has the same eigenstates as the <lb/>corresponding system in standard quantum mechanics. Therefore, the position representation <lb/>eigenstates are given by <lb/> x|ψ = <lb/> 2 <lb/> L <lb/> sin <lb/> nπ x <lb/>L <lb/> (A.8) <lb/>for 0  x  L and 0 elsewhere. And the momentum representation eigenstates are given by <lb/>the Fourier transform <lb/> p|ψ = <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2π ¯ <lb/> h <lb/>  L <lb/> 0 <lb/> dx e <lb/> ipx/¯ h <lb/> x|ψ. <lb/> (A.9) <lb/>In Snyder space, the quantization of space follows from requiring p to be periodic. <lb/>However, p|ψ as given in equation (A.9) is not explicitly periodic. There are no remaining <lb/>parameters to be fixed in order to impose periodicity on p|ψ. The resulting expression <lb/>cannot be considered a result characteristic of Snyder space until the periodicity condition is <lb/>met. This is achieved by imposing the condition directly by defining <lb/> p|ψ = <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2π ¯ <lb/> h <lb/>  L <lb/> 0 <lb/> dx e <lb/> ipx/¯ h <lb/> x|ψ <lb/> (A.10) <lb/>for −π/2 <lb/> √ <lb/> αp  π/2 with other values defined recursively by ψ(p + π <lb/> √ <lb/> α) = ψ(p). <lb/> This is equivalent to simply restricting the value of p to the corresponding interval. <lb/>The particular interval is symmetric around p = 0 and ensures that the Snyder space result <lb/>reduces to the standard quantum-mechanical result in the low-energy limit with a non-zero <lb/>energy for the ground state. <lb/>If it were possible to satisfy the periodic boundary condition by appropriately choosing <lb/>constants introduced by solving the differential equations, then standard quantum mechanics <lb/>would not explain how to choose these constants. It is reasonable to expect that, in mapping <lb/>problems from Snyder space to standard quantum mechanics, the solutions in standard quantum <lb/>mechanics contain excess information that should be discarded. This excess information is a <lb/>consequence of standard quantum mechanics being calculated on a continuous space, while <lb/>Snyder space uses discrete positions. <lb/></body>
