Our goal is to present a pedagogical introduction to a <lb/>range of topics and we have focused on referring to review literature that are especially useful for <lb/>further reading. We refer the reader to those materials for more complete references to original <lb/>literature and apologize for any omissions in our citations or choice of topics. <lb/> 1 The Hierarchy Problem <lb/> At loop level, the Higgs mass receives corrections from self interactions, gauge loops, and fermion <lb/>loops (especially the top quark). Diagrammatically, <lb/> = <lb/> + <lb/>+ <lb/></body>

			<page> 2 <lb/></page>

			<body> These loops are quadratically divergent and go like <lb/> d <lb/> 4  k (k <lb/> 2  − m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> −1  ∼ Λ <lb/> 2  for some cutoff scale <lb/>Λ. Explicitly, <lb/> δm <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  = <lb/>Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> 32π  2 <lb/> 6λ + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> 9g <lb/> 2  + 3g <lb/> 2 <lb/> − y <lb/> 2 <lb/> t <lb/> (1.1) <lb/>If Λ  10 tev (for example, Λ ∼ M  Pl  ), then the quantum correction to the Higgs mass is much <lb/>larger than the mass itself, δm <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  . This is the Hierarchy problem: the Higgs mass is <lb/>quadratically sensitive to any mass scale of new physics. This problem is specific to elementary <lb/>scalars. <lb/>Unlike scalars, the quantum corrections to fermion and gauge boson masses are proportional to <lb/>the particle masses themselves. In this way, small fermion and gauge boson masses are technically <lb/>natural: the loop corrections are suppressed by the smallness of the tree-level parameter. For <lb/>fermions this is because of the appearance of a new chiral symmetry in the massless limit. For <lb/>gauge bosons this is because gauge symmetry is restored in the massless limit. By dimensional <lb/>analysis, the corrections to these mass parameters cannot be quadratically sensitive to the cutoff, <lb/>Λ, <lb/>∆m  e  ∼ m  e  ln <lb/> Λ <lb/> m  e <lb/> (1.2) <lb/>∆M <lb/> 2 <lb/> W  ∼ M <lb/> 2 <lb/> W  ln <lb/> Λ <lb/> m  e <lb/> . <lb/> (1.3) <lb/>The Hierarchy problem is independent of the renormalization scheme. It is sometimes argued <lb/>that in dimensional regularization there are no quadratic divergences since the 1// poles correspond <lb/>to logarithmic divergences. This is fallacious. The Hierarchy problem isn&apos;t about the cancellation of <lb/>divergences, it is about the separation of the electroweak and uv scales. Any new physics coupled <lb/>to the Higgs will reintroduce the quadratic dependence on the scale at which the new physics <lb/>appears. For example, suppose new physics enters at the scale m  S  by a four-point interaction <lb/>between the Higgs and an additional complex scalar, ∆L ⊃ λ  S  |H| <lb/> 2  |S| <lb/> 2  . The contribution to the <lb/>Higgs mass from a loop of the S particle is <lb/> δm <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  = <lb/> λ  S <lb/> 16π  2 <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/>UV  − 2m <lb/> 2 <lb/> S  ln <lb/> Λ  UV <lb/> m  S <lb/> + (finite) <lb/> . <lb/> (1.4) <lb/>Suppose one chose to ignore the term quadratic in the loop regulator, Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/>UV  —note that there&apos;s no <lb/>justification to do this—the logarithmically divergent piece (corresponding to the 1//) and the <lb/>finite pieces are proportional to the squared mass scale of the new physics, m <lb/> 2 <lb/> S  . The regulator <lb/>Λ  UV  is not a physical scale, but m <lb/> 2 <lb/> S  is the scale of new physics. The Higgs mass is quadratically <lb/>sensitive to this scale, no matter how one chooses to regulate the loop. <lb/>This quadratic sensitivity is true even if these new states are not directly coupled to the Higgs <lb/>but only interact with other Standard Model fields. For example, suppose there were a pair of <lb/>heavy fermions Ψ which are charged under the Standard Model gauge group but don&apos;t directly <lb/>interact with the Higgs. One still expects two loop contributions to the Higgs mass from diagrams <lb/>such as those in Fig. 1. These contributions are of the form <lb/> δm <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  ∼ <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> 16π  2 <lb/> aΛ <lb/> 2 <lb/>UV  + 48m <lb/> 2 <lb/> F  ln <lb/>Λ  UV <lb/> m  F <lb/> + (finite) <lb/> . <lb/> (1.5) <lb/></body>

			<body> Ψ <lb/> Ψ <lb/>Figure 1: Heuristic two-loop contributions to the Higgs mass from heavy fermions, Ψ. Even though <lb/>the Ψ do not directly couple to the Higgs, they reintroduce a quadratic sensitivity to the new scale. <lb/>This is indeed of the same form as (1.4). Note that in this case, the sensitivity to the new scale is <lb/>softened by a loop factor. <lb/>The Higgs mass operator |H| <lb/> 2  is a relevant and thus grows in the infrared. From the Wilsonian <lb/>perspective, the Hierarchy problem is the statement that is is difficult (finely tuned) to choose a <lb/>renormalization group trajectory that flows to the correct Higgs mass. In summary, the Hierarchy <lb/>problem is the issue that the Higgs mass m  H  is sensitive to any high scale in the theory, even if <lb/>it only indirectly couples to the Standard Model. Thus na¨ vely one would expect that m  H  should <lb/>be on the order of the scale of new physics. In the Wilsonian picture, the Higgs mass is a relevant <lb/>operator and so its importance grows towards the ir. Indeed, m  H  is the only relevant operator in <lb/>the Standard Model. <lb/>The implication of the Hierarchy problem is that there should to be new physics at the tev <lb/> scale that eliminates the large loop contributions from above the tev scale <lb/> 1  . In these lectures we <lb/>explore some of options for the physics beyond the sm that enforce naturalness. Before going into <lb/>further detail, here is a brief overview of some of the possibilities for this to happen: <lb/> • Supersymmetry: relate the elementary scalar Higgs to fermions in such a way that the <lb/>chiral symmetry protecting the fermion mass is extended to also protect the scalar mass. <lb/> • Gauge-Higgs unification: relate the the elementary scalar Higgs to an elementary gauge <lb/>field so that gauge symmetry also protects the Higgs mass. <lb/> • Technicolor, Higgsless: there is no Higgs boson, just a dynamically generated condensate. <lb/> • Composite Higgs, warped extra dimensions: There is a Higgs, but it is not elementary. <lb/>At the tev scale the Higgs &quot; dissolves &quot; : it becomes sensitive to large form factors that <lb/>suppresses corrections. <lb/> • Pseudo-Goldstone Higgs: The Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously bro-<lb/>ken symmetry. This gives some protection against quadratic divergences, usually removing <lb/>the one-loop contribution. In practice one must still combine with additional mechanisms, <lb/>such as in little Higgs models. <lb/> • Large extra dimensions: The fundamental Planck scale is actually ∼ tev and only appears <lb/>much larger because gravity is diluted through its propagation in more directions. <lb/></body>

			<front> 2 Supersymmetry Recall that under an infinitesimal transformation by an &apos;ordinary&apos; internal symmetry, a quantum <lb/>field φ transforms as <lb/> ϕ  i  → (1  ij  + ii <lb/> a  T <lb/> a <lb/>ij  )ϕ  j  , <lb/> (2.1) <lb/></front>

			<body>where <lb/> a  is an infinitesimal parameter, T <lb/> a  is the [bosonic] generator of the symmetry, and i, j label <lb/>the representation of φ with respect to this symmetry. These internal symmetries do not change <lb/>the spin of φ: bosons remain bosons and fermions remain fermions. Supersymmetry (susy) <lb/>is a generalization of this &apos;ordinary&apos; symmetry where generator is now fermionic. Thus a susy <lb/> transformation changes fermions into bosons and vice versa. <lb/> Further reading: Wess and Bagger [2] is the canonical reference for the tools of supersymmetry. The text <lb/>by Terning has a broad overview of susy and its modern applications in particle physics. Additional reviews <lb/>include [3–5]. Key historical papers are collected in [6] and a more personal account is presented in [7]. More <lb/>formal topics in susy that are beyond the scope of these lectures, but are key tools for model builders, can be <lb/>found in [8–10]. <lb/> 2.1 The SUSY algebra <lb/> The &apos;60s were very successful for classifying hadrons based on Gell-Mann&apos;s SU(3) internal symme-<lb/>try. Physicists then tried to enlarge this group to SU(6) so that it would include <lb/>SU(3)  Gell-Mann  × SU(2)  spin  , <lb/> (2.2) <lb/>but they were unable to construct a viable relativistic model. Later this was understood to be a <lb/>result of the Coleman-Mandula &apos;no go&apos; theorem which states that one cannot construct a consistent <lb/>quantum field theory based on a nontrivial combination of internal symmetries with space-time <lb/>symmetry [11]. The one exception came from Haag, Lopuszanski, and Sohnius: the only non-<lb/>trivial combination of an internal and spacetime symmetry is to use a graded Lie algebra whose <lb/>generators are fermionic [12]. Recall that fermionic objects obey anti-commutation relations rather <lb/>than commutation relations. The main anti-commutation relation for susy is: <lb/> Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  , Q  ˙ <lb/> α  B <lb/> = 2P  µ  σ <lb/> µ <lb/>α ˙ <lb/> β <lb/> δ <lb/> A <lb/>B  , <lb/> (2.3) <lb/>where the Q and Q are susy generators (supercharges) and P  µ  is the momentum operator. Here <lb/>the α and ˙ <lb/> α are Lorentz indices while A, B index the number of supercharges. For completeness, <lb/>the rest of the algebra is <lb/>[M <lb/> µν  , M <lb/> ρσ  ] = i(M <lb/> µν  η <lb/> νρ  + M <lb/> νρ  η <lb/> µσ  − M <lb/> µρ  η <lb/> νσ  − M <lb/> νσ  η <lb/> µρ  ) <lb/>(2.4) <lb/>[P <lb/> µ  , P <lb/> ν  ] = 0 <lb/>(2.5) <lb/>[M <lb/> µν  , P <lb/> σ  ] = i(P <lb/> µ  η <lb/> νσ  − P <lb/> ν  η <lb/> µσ  ) <lb/>(2.6) <lb/>[Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  , M <lb/> µν  ] = (σ <lb/> µν  ) <lb/> β <lb/>α  Q <lb/> A <lb/>β <lb/> (2.7) <lb/>[Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  , P <lb/> µ  ] = 0 <lb/>(2.8) <lb/> {Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  , Q <lb/> B <lb/>β  } =  αβ  Z <lb/> AB  . <lb/> (2.9) <lb/></body>

			<body> The Z <lb/> AB  may appear for N &gt; 1 and are known as central charges. By the Coleman-Mandula <lb/>theorem, we know that internal symmetry generators commute with the Poincaré generators. For <lb/>example, the Standard Model gauge group commutes with the momentum, rotation, and boost <lb/>operators. This carries over to the susy algebra. For an internal symmetry generator T  a  , <lb/>[T  a  , Q  α  ] = 0. <lb/>(2.10) <lb/>This is true with one exception. The susy generators come equipped with their own internal <lb/>symmetry, called R-symmetry. For N = 1 there exists an automorphism of the supersymmetry <lb/>algebra, <lb/> Q  α  → e <lb/> it  Q  α <lb/> Q  ˙ <lb/> α  → e <lb/> −it  Q  ˙ <lb/> α  , <lb/> (2.11) <lb/>for some transformation parameter t. This is a U(1) internal symmetry. Applying this symmetry <lb/>preserves the SUSY algebra. If R is the generator of this U(1), then its action on the susy <lb/> operators is given by <lb/> Q  α  → e <lb/> −iRt  Q  α  e <lb/> iRt  . <lb/> (2.12) <lb/>By comparing the transformation of Q under (2.12), we find the corresponding algebra, <lb/>[Q  α  , R] = Q  α <lb/> [Q  ˙ <lb/> α  , R] = −Q  ˙ <lb/> α  . <lb/> (2.13) <lb/>Note that this means that different components of a susy multiplet have different R charge. For <lb/> N &gt; 1 the R-symmetry group enlarges to U(N ). <lb/> 2.2 Properties of supersymmetric theories <lb/> Supersymmetric theories obey some key properties: <lb/>1. The number of fermionic degrees of freedom equals the number of bosonic degrees of freedom. <lb/>To see this, first introduce an operator (−) <lb/> N  F  such that, <lb/>(−) <lb/> N  F  |q = <lb/> + |q <lb/> boson <lb/> − |q <lb/> fermion <lb/>(2.14) <lb/>where N  F  is the fermion number operator. Note that <lb/>(−) <lb/> N  F  Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  |q = −Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  (−) <lb/> N  F  |q <lb/> (2.15) <lb/>so that (−) <lb/> N  F  and the supercharges anticommute, <lb/> (−) <lb/> N  F  , Q <lb/> A <lb/>α <lb/> = 0. Next consider the <lb/>operator in (2.3) weighted by (−) <lb/> N  F  . When one sums over the states in a representation— <lb/>which we write as a trace over the operator—one finds: <lb/>Tr <lb/> (−) <lb/> N  F <lb/> Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  , Q <lb/> B <lb/> ˙ <lb/> β <lb/> = Tr <lb/> −Q <lb/> A <lb/>α  (−) <lb/> N  F  Q <lb/> B <lb/> ˙ <lb/> β  + (−) <lb/> N  F  Q <lb/> B <lb/> ˙ <lb/> β  Q <lb/> A <lb/>α <lb/> = 0, <lb/>(2.16) <lb/>where in the last step we&apos;ve used the cyclicity of the trace to convert the first term into <lb/>the second term up to a minus sign. By (2.3) the left-hand side of this equation is simply <lb/>Tr <lb/> (−) <lb/> N  F  2σ <lb/> µ <lb/>α ˙ <lb/> β <lb/> P  µ <lb/> . Note that since Poincaré symmetry is assumed to be unbroken, P  µ  is <lb/>identical for each state in a representation. Thus we are left with the conclusion that <lb/>Tr(−) <lb/> N  F  = 0, <lb/>(2.17) <lb/>which implies that there is an equal number of fermions and bosons. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2. All states in a supersymmetry multiplet (&apos;supermultiplet&apos; or superfield) have the same mass. <lb/>This follows from the equivalence of P  µ  acting on these states. <lb/>3. Energy for any state Ψ is positive semi-definite Ψ|H|Ψ ≥ 0 and the energy for any vacuum <lb/>with unbroken susy vanishes exactly, 0|H|0 = 0. <lb/> 2.3 Classification of supersymmetry representations <lb/> For the basic case of N = 1 susy there is a single supercharge Q and its conjugate Q. The massless <lb/>representations of this class of theories are separated into two cases: <lb/> • (anti-)chiral superfield: contains a complex scalar and a 2-component (Weyl) spinor. <lb/> • vector superfield: contains a 2-component (Weyl) spinor and a gauge field. <lb/>These are the only N = 1 representations that do not involve fields with spin greater than 1. <lb/> Multiplets when there is more supersymmetry. If there are more susy charges, e.g. N = 2, then the <lb/>smallest representation is the hypermultiplet which contains a 4-component (Dirac) fermion and two complex <lb/>scalars. For supersymmetric extensions of the sm it is sufficient to focus only on the N = 1 case since this is <lb/>the only case which admits the observed chiral fermions of the Standard Model. <lb/> One can compare the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in these representa-<lb/>tions. In the chiral superfield, the complex scalar carries 2 degrees of freedom while the complex <lb/>Weyl spinor carries 4 degrees of freedom. Recall, however, that fermions only have two helicity <lb/>states so that in fact only 2 of these fermionic degrees of freedom propagate on-shell. Since one <lb/>of the key points of using fields to describe physical particles is that we can describe off-shell <lb/>propagation, we would like to also have supersymmetry hold off-shell. This requires adding two <lb/>&apos;dummy&apos; scalar degrees of freedom, which we package in a non-propagating &apos;auxiliary&apos; complex <lb/>field F : <lb/>Field <lb/>off-shell degrees of freedom on-shell degrees of freedom <lb/>scalar, φ <lb/> 2 <lb/>2 <lb/>fermion, ψ <lb/> 4 <lb/>2 <lb/>auxiliary, F <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 <lb/>For the vector superfield the Weyl spinor has 4 (2) off-(on-)shell degrees of freedom while the <lb/>massless gauge boson has 3 (2) off(on-)shell degrees of freedom after identifying gauge equivalent <lb/>states. As in the chiral superfield, the number of on-shell degrees of freedom match automatically <lb/>while the number of off-shell degrees of freedom require an additional non-propagating auxiliary <lb/>field. In this case we introduce a real scalar, D: <lb/> Field <lb/>off-shell degrees of freedom on-shell degrees of freedom <lb/>fermion, ψ <lb/> 4 <lb/>2 <lb/>gauge boson, A  µ <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/>auxiliary, D <lb/> 1 <lb/>0 <lb/></body>

			<body> 2.4 Superspace <lb/> The most convenient way to describe N = 1 supersymmetric field theories is to use the superspace <lb/> formalism. Here we understand the supersymmetry transformation generated by Q and Q to be <lb/>a spacetime transformation in an additional fermionic dimension. To do this, we introduce Weyl <lb/>spinor superspace coordinates θ  α  and ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> ˙ <lb/> α  . Superfields are functions of x, θ, and ¯ <lb/> θ and encode all of <lb/>the off-shell degrees of freedom of a supermultiplet. <lb/> Weyl spinors and van der Waerden notation. We assume familiarity with two-component Weyl spinors. <lb/>These are the natural language for fermions in four-dimensions. We use the van der Waerden notation with <lb/>dotted and undotted indices to distinguish the indices of left-and right-chiral spinors. Readers unfamiliar with <lb/>this notation may consult [2, 13]. The encyclopedic &apos;two component bible&apos; is a useful reference for full details <lb/>and as a template for doing calculations [14]. <lb/> The susy algebra tells us that the effect of a susy transformation with infinitesimal parameters <lb/> and ¯ <lb/> on a superspace coordinate (x, θ, ¯ <lb/> θ) is <lb/>(x <lb/> µ  , θ, ¯ <lb/> θ) → (x <lb/> µ  + iθσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> − iiσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> θ, θ + , ¯ <lb/> θ + ¯ <lb/> ). <lb/> (2.18) <lb/>It is useful to define the superspace covariant derivatives, <lb/> D  α  = + <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂θ  α  + iσ <lb/> µ <lb/>α ˙ <lb/> α <lb/> ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> ˙ <lb/> α  ∂  µ <lb/> D  ˙ <lb/> α  = − <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂ ¯ <lb/> θ  ˙ <lb/> α <lb/> − iθ <lb/> α  σ <lb/> µ <lb/>α ˙ <lb/> α  ∂  µ  . <lb/> (2.19) <lb/>These are &apos;covariant derivatives&apos; in that they anticommute with the susy generators <lb/> 2  . They satisfy <lb/> {D  α  , D  ˙ <lb/> β  } = −2i(σ <lb/> µ  )  α ˙ <lb/> β  ∂  µ <lb/> and <lb/> {D  α  , D  β  } = {D  ˙ <lb/> α  , D  ˙ <lb/> β  } = 0 <lb/>(2.20) <lb/>By expanding in the fermionic coordinates, a generic superfield F (x, θ, ¯ <lb/> θ) can be written in <lb/>terms of component fields of different spin that propagate on ordinary spacetime, <lb/> F (x, θ, ¯ <lb/> θ) = f (x) + θψ(x) + ¯ <lb/> θ ¯ <lb/> χ(x) + θ <lb/> 2  M (x) + ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  N (x) + θσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> θv  µ  (x) + θ <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ ¯ <lb/> λ(x) + ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  θξ + θ <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  D(x). <lb/> This expansion is exact because higher powers of θ or ¯ <lb/> θ vanish identically because an anticommuting <lb/>number θ  1  satisfies (θ  1  ) <lb/> 2  = 0. As a sanity check, we are allowed quadratic terms in θ since it is a <lb/>Weyl spinor and θ <lb/> 2  = θ <lb/> α  θ  α  = <lb/> αβ  θ  β  θ  α  = 2θ  1  θ  2  . <lb/>With modest effort, one can work out the transformation of each component of this general <lb/>superfield by applying the transformation (2.18), expanding all fields in θ and ¯ <lb/> θ, and matching <lb/>the coefficients of each term. Some of the terms require massaging by Fierz identities to get to <lb/>the correct form. Fortunately, the general superfield above is a reducible representation: some of <lb/>these fields do not transform into one another. We can restrict to irreducible representations by <lb/>imposing one of the following conditions: <lb/>chiral superfield <lb/> D  α  Φ = 0 <lb/>(2.21) <lb/>anti-chiral superfield <lb/> D  ˙ <lb/> α  Φ = 0 <lb/>(2.22) <lb/>vector (real) superfield <lb/> V = V <lb/>  † <lb/> (2.23) <lb/>linear superfield <lb/> D <lb/> 2  L = D <lb/> 2  L = 0 <lb/>(2.24) <lb/></body>

			<body> The chiral and anti-chiral superfields carry Weyl fermions of left-and right-handed helicity respec-<lb/>tively. It is convenient to write all anti-chiral superfields into chiral superfields, for example by <lb/>swapping the right-handed electron chiral superfield with a left-handed positron superfield. The <lb/>field content is identical, one is just swapping which is the &apos;particle&apos; and which is the &apos;anti-particle.&apos; <lb/> The linear superfield. The defining condition for this superfield includes a constraint that the vector com-<lb/>ponent is divergence free, ∂  µ  V <lb/> µ  = 0. It is thus a natural supersymmetrization of a conserved current. We will <lb/>not consider linear superfields further in these lectures. <lb/> 2.5 Supersymmetric Lagrangians for chiral superfields <lb/> One can check that because D  ˙ <lb/> α  (x <lb/> µ  + iθσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> θ) = 0, any function of y <lb/> µ  = x <lb/> µ  + iθσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> θ is automatically <lb/>a chiral superfield (χsf). Indeed, the most compact way of writing the components of a χsf is <lb/>Φ(y, θ) = ϕ(y) + <lb/> √ <lb/> 2θψ(y) + θ <lb/> 2  F (y). <lb/>(2.25) <lb/>Again, we point out that this expansion is exact since higher powers of the Weyl spinor θ vanish <lb/>by the antisymmetry of its components. Under a susy transformation with parameter , the <lb/>components of the χsf each transform as <lb/> δ   ϕ(x) = <lb/> √ <lb/> 2ψ(x) <lb/>(2.26) <lb/> δψ(x) = i <lb/> √ <lb/> 2σ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> ∂  µ  ϕ(x) + <lb/> √ <lb/> 2F (x) <lb/>(2.27) <lb/> δ   F (x) = i <lb/> √ <lb/> 2¯ ¯ σ <lb/> µ  ∂  µ  ψ(x). <lb/> (2.28) <lb/>Observe that the auxiliary field transforms into a total spacetime derivative. This is especially nice <lb/>since a total derivative vanishes in the action and so the highest component of a χsf is a candidate <lb/>for a susy-invariant term in the Lagrangian. Thus we arrive at our first way of constructing <lb/>supersymmetric Lagrangian terms: write the F -term of a chiral superfield. <lb/>To generate interesting interactions we don&apos;t want to write the F -terms of our fundamental <lb/>fields—indeed, these are generally not even gauge invariant. Fortunately, one can check that <lb/>a product of chiral superfields is itself a chiral superfield. Indeed, a general way of writing a <lb/>supersymmetry Lagrangian term built out of chiral superfields is <lb/> L = <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ W (Φ) + h.c., <lb/>(2.29) <lb/>where W is a holomorphic function of chiral superfields called the superpotential. Note that the <lb/>integral over d <lb/> 2  θ is an ordinary fermionic integral that just picks out the highest component of W . <lb/>Performing the fermionic integral gives Lagrangian terms <lb/> L = − <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  W (ϕ) <lb/> ∂Φ  i  ∂Φ  j <lb/> ψ  i  ψ  j  − <lb/> i <lb/> ∂W (ϕ) <lb/> ∂Φ  i <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (2.30) <lb/>Observe that the superpotential is evaluated on the scalar components of the superfields, Φ = ϕ. <lb/> One can check that restricting to renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian limits the mass dimension <lb/>of the superpotential to [W ] ≤ 3. <lb/></body>

			<body> Cancellation of quadratic divergences. One can check from explicit calculations that the susy formalism <lb/>ensures the existence of superpartner particles with just the right couplings to cancel quadratic divergences. A <lb/>more elegant way to see this, however, is to note that the symmetries of superspace itself prevent this. While <lb/>it is beyond the scope of these lectures, the superpotential is not renormalized perturbatively—see, e.g. [8, 16] <lb/>for details. The holomorphy of W plays a key role in these arguments. The symmetries of the theory enforce <lb/>the technical naturalness of parameters in W , including scalar masses. <lb/> Superpotential terms, however, do not include the usual kinetic terms for propagating fields. <lb/>In fact, one can show that these terms appear in the θ <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  term of the combination <lb/>Φ <lb/>  †  Φ <lb/> θ  2  ¯ <lb/> θ  2  = F F <lb/>  *  + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> ϕ <lb/>  *  ∂ <lb/> 2  ϕ + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  ϕ <lb/>  *  ϕ − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∂  µ  ϕ <lb/>  *  ∂ <lb/> µ  ϕ + <lb/> i <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∂  µ  ¯ <lb/> ψ¯ σ <lb/> µ  ψ − <lb/> i <lb/> 2 <lb/>¯ <lb/> ψ¯ σ∂  µ  ψ. <lb/> (2.31) <lb/>Two immediate observations are in order: <lb/>1. The complex scalar ϕ and Weyl fermion ψ each have their canonical kinetic term. The non-<lb/>propagating field, F , does not have any derivative terms: its equation of motion is algebraic <lb/>and can be solved explicitly. This is precisely what is meant that F is auxiliary. <lb/>2. Φ <lb/>  †  Φ is not a chiral superfield. In fact, it&apos;s a real superfield and the θ <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  component is the <lb/>auxiliary D field. Indeed, in the same way that the highest component of a χsf transforms <lb/>into a total derivative, the highest component of a real superfield also transforms into a total <lb/>derivative and is a candidate term for the Lagrangian. <lb/>We thus arrive at the second way to write supersymmetric Lagrangian terms: take the D-term <lb/> of a real superfield. We may write this term as an integral over superspace, <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ Φ <lb/>  †  Φ, where <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ = d <lb/> 2  θ d <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ. <lb/> More generally, we may write a generic real function K(Φ, Φ <lb/>  †  ) of chiral superfields, Φ and <lb/>Φ <lb/>  †  , whose D term is supersymmetric contribution to the Lagrangian. This is called the K¨ähler <lb/>potential. The simplest Kähler potential built out of chiral superfields is precisely (2.31) and <lb/>includes the necessary kinetic terms for the chiral superfield. One can check that restricting to <lb/>renormalizable terms in the Lagrangian limits the mass dimension of the Kähler potential to <lb/>[K] ≤ 2. Combined with the condition that K is real and the observation that chiral superfields <lb/>are typically not gauge invariant, this usually restricts the Kähler potential to take the canonical <lb/>form, K = Φ <lb/>  † <lb/> i  Φ  i  . <lb/>The most general N = 1 supersymmetric Lagrangian for chiral superfields is thus <lb/> L = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ K(Φ, Φ <lb/>  †  ) + <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ W (Φ) + h.c. <lb/> . <lb/> (2.32) <lb/>This expression is general, but renormalizability restricts the mass dimensions to be [K] ≤ 2 and <lb/>[W ] ≤ 3. For theories with more supersymmetry, e.g. N = 2, one must impose additional relations <lb/>between K and W . Assuming a renormalizable supersymmetric theory of chiral superfields Φ  i  , we <lb/>may plug in K = Φ <lb/>  † <lb/> i  Φ  i  and integrate out the auxiliary fields from (2.32). The result is <lb/> L = ∂  µ  ϕ <lb/>  * <lb/> i  ∂ <lb/> µ  ϕ  i  + i ¯ <lb/> ψ  i  ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> µ  ∂  µ  ψ  i  − <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  W <lb/>∂ϕ  i  ∂ϕ  j <lb/> ψ  i  ψ  j  − <lb/> i <lb/> ∂W <lb/>∂ϕ  i <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (2.33) <lb/>Here the superpotential is assumed to be evaluated at its lowest component so that W [Φ  i  (y, θ)] → <lb/> W [ϕ  i  (x)]. Observe that dimension-2 terms in the superpotential link the mass terms of the Weyl <lb/>fermion and the complex scalar. Further, dimension-3 terms in the superpotential connect Yukawa <lb/>interactions to quartic scalar couplings. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2.6 Supersymmetric Lagrangians for vector superfields <lb/> Until now, however, we have only described supersymmetric theories of complex scalars and <lb/>fermions packaged as chiral superfields. In order to include the interactions of gauge fields we <lb/>must write down susy Lagrangians that include vector superfields. <lb/>Suppose a set of chiral superfields Φ carry a U(1) charge such that Φ(x) → exp(−iΛ)Φ(x). For <lb/>an ordinary global symmetry this is an overall phase on each component of the chiral superfield. <lb/>For a gauge symmetry, the transformation parameter is spacetime dependent, Λ = Λ(x). Note, <lb/>however, that this is now problematic because our definition of a chiral superfield, D  α  Φ = 0, <lb/>contains a spacetime derivative. It would appear that the na¨ ve gauge transformation is not <lb/>consistent with the irreducible susy representations we&apos;ve written because it does not preserve the <lb/>chiral superfield condition. <lb/>This inconsistency is a relic of keeping Λ(x) a function of spacetime rather than a function of the <lb/>full superspace. We noted above that a function of y <lb/> µ  = x <lb/> µ  +iθσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> θ is a chiral superfield and, further, <lb/>that a product of chiral superfields is also a chiral superfield. Thus a consistent way to include <lb/>gauge transformations is to promote Λ(x) to a chiral superfield Λ(y) so that exp(−iΛ(y))Φ(y) is <lb/>indeed chiral. In this way we see that supersymmetry has &apos;complexified&apos; the gauge group. <lb/>Under this complexified gauge transformation, the canonical Kähler potential term that con-<lb/>tains the kinetic terms transforms to <lb/>Φ <lb/>  †  Φ → Φ <lb/>  †  e <lb/> −i(Λ−Λ  †  )  Φ. <lb/>(2.34) <lb/>For gauge theories one must modify the Kähler potential to accommodate this factor. This is <lb/>unsurprising since gauging an ordinary quantum field theory requires one to modify the kinetic <lb/>terms by promoting derivatives to covariant derivatives which include the gauge field. To correctly <lb/>gauge a symmetry, we introduce a vector (real) superfield (vsf) V which transforms according to <lb/> V → V + i(Λ − Λ <lb/>  †  ) <lb/>(2.35) <lb/>and promote the Kähler potential to <lb/> K(Φ, Φ <lb/>  †  ) = Φ <lb/>  †  e <lb/> V  Φ. <lb/>(2.36) <lb/>A generic vsf has many components, but many can be eliminated by partially gauge fixing to <lb/>the Wess-Zumino gauge where <lb/> V = − θσ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> θV  µ  (x) + iθ <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ ¯ <lb/> λ(x) − i ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  θλ(x) + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  ¯ <lb/> θ <lb/> 2  D(x). <lb/> (2.37) <lb/>here V  µ  (x) is the gauge field of the local symmetry, λ(x) and ¯ <lb/> λ(x) = λ <lb/>  †  (x) are gauginos, and <lb/> D(x) is the auxiliary field needed to match off-shell fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. The <lb/>two gauginos are the pair of two-component spinors that make up a Majorana four-component <lb/>spinor. This gauge choice fixes the complex part of the &apos;complexified&apos; gauge symmetry, leaving <lb/>the ordinary spacetime (rather than superspace) gauge redundancy that we are familiar with in <lb/>quantum field theory. <lb/>We have not yet written a kinetic term for the vector superfield. A useful first step is to <lb/>construct the chiral superfield, <lb/> W  α  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> D <lb/> ˙ <lb/> α  D  ˙ <lb/> α  D  α  V <lb/> (2.38) <lb/>= − iλ  α  (y) + θ  β <lb/> δ <lb/> β <lb/>α  D(y) − <lb/> i <lb/> 2 <lb/>(σ <lb/> µ  ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> ν  ) <lb/> β <lb/>α  F  µν  (y) <lb/> + θ <lb/> 2  σ <lb/> µ <lb/>α ˙ <lb/> α  ∂  µ  ¯ <lb/> λ <lb/> ˙ <lb/> α  (y). <lb/>(2.39) <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body> One can see that W  α  is a chiral superfield because D  ˙ <lb/> β  W  α  = 0 from the antisymmetry of the <lb/>components of ¯ <lb/> D, (2.20). Observe that unlike Φ, the lowest component is a spin-1/2 field. Further, <lb/> W contains the usual gauge field strength. Indeed, one can write the supersymmetric Yang Mills <lb/>kinetic terms for the vector superfield as <lb/> L  SYM  = <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> W  α  W <lb/> α  | <lb/> 2 <lb/> θ  + h.c. = <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θW <lb/> 2  + h.c.. <lb/>(2.40) <lb/>One can check that this gives the usual kinetic terms for the gauge field and gauginos as well <lb/>as an auxiliary term. For completeness, the general form of the field strength superfield for a <lb/>non-Abelian supersymmetric gauge theory is <lb/> T <lb/> a  W <lb/> a <lb/>α  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> D <lb/> ˙ <lb/> a  D  ˙ <lb/> a  e <lb/> −T  a  V  a  D  α  e <lb/> T  a  V  a  . <lb/> (2.41) <lb/>Under a non-Abelian gauge transformation the chiral and vector superfields transform as <lb/>Φ → e <lb/> −gT  a  Λ  a  Φ <lb/>(2.42) <lb/> e <lb/> T  a  V  a  → e <lb/> T  a  Λ  a †  e <lb/> T  a  V  a  e <lb/> T  a  Λ  a  . <lb/> (2.43) <lb/>The final form of the renormalizable, gauge-invariant, N = 1 supersymmetric Lagrangian is <lb/> L = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θΦ <lb/>  † <lb/> i  e <lb/> gV  Φ  i  + <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> W <lb/> a <lb/>α  W <lb/> αa  + h.c. <lb/> + <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ (W (Φ) + h.c.) . <lb/> (2.44) <lb/> Non-renormalization and the gauge kinetic term. Although W <lb/> 2  looks like it could be a superpotential <lb/>term, it is important to treat it separately since it is the kinetic term for the gauge fields. Further the arguments <lb/>that the superpotential is not renormalized in perturbation theory do not hold for the W <lb/> 2  term. Indeed, the <lb/>prefactor of W <lb/> 2  can be identified with the [holomorphic] gauge coupling, which is only corrected perturbatively <lb/>at one loop order. One way to see this is to note that for non-Abelian theories, the gauge kinetic term <lb/> W <lb/> 2  d <lb/> 2  θ + h.c. also includes a topological term, F <lb/> F , which we know is related to anomalies. Another way to <lb/>see this is the note that the simplest demonstration of non-renormalization of the superpotential makes use of <lb/>holomorphy and the global symmetries of W : the vector (real) superfield from which W  α  is built, however, is <lb/>not holomorphic and its fields cannot carry have the U(1) global symmetries used in the proof. <lb/> 2.7 Example: SUSY QED <lb/> As a simple example, consider the supersymmetric version of quantum electrodynamics, sqed. In <lb/>ordinary qed we start with a Dirac spinor representing the electron and positron. Since we&apos;ve <lb/>seen above that a chiral superfield only contains a Weyl spinor, we require two chiral superfields, <lb/>Φ  ±  , which we may interpret to be the electron and positron superfields. Our only two inputs are <lb/>the electromagnetic coupling e and the electron mass m. The latter suggests a superpotential <lb/> W (Φ  +  , Φ  −  ) = mΦ  +  Φ  −  . <lb/> (2.45) <lb/></body>

The last line gives vertices that come from the supersymmetrization of the kinetic <lb/>terms: four-point scalar interactions from the D terms and a three-point Yukawa-like vertex with <lb/>the &apos;chiral&apos; scalars and photino. The relation between the gauge group and the four-point scalar <lb/>interaction plays a central role in how the Higgs fits into susy, as we show below. <lb/> 2.8 The MSSM <lb/> We now focus on the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, the mssm. To <lb/>go from the sm to the mssm, it is sufficient to promote each sm chiral fermion into a chiral <lb/>superfield and each sm gauge field into a vector superfield. Thus for each sm fermion there is a <lb/>new propagating scalar sfermion (squarks or sleptons) and for each sm gauge field there is also a <lb/>propagating gaugino, a fermion in the adjoint representation. As we showed above, off-shell susy <lb/> also implies non-propagating auxiliary fields. <lb/>The matter (χsf) content of the mssm is shown in Table 1. It is the same as the sm except <lb/>that we require two Higgs doublet chiral superfields. This is necessary for the cancellation of <lb/>the SU(2) <lb/> 2 <lb/>L  ×U(1)  Y  and SU(2)  L  Witten anomalies coming from the Higgs fermions, or Higgsinos. <lb/>An additional hint that this is necessary comes from the observation that the superpotential is a <lb/>holomorphic function of the chiral superfields while the Standard Model up-type Yukawa coupling <lb/>requires the conjugate of the Higgs, <lb/> H = iσ <lb/> 2  H <lb/>  *  . <lb/></body>

Otherwise one would be faced with dangerous rates for rare processes such as proton <lb/>decay, p <lb/> +  → e <lb/> +  π <lb/> 0  or ¯ <lb/> νπ <lb/> +  (or alternately with π replaced with K) as shown in Fig. 2. Observe <lb/>that this is a tree level process and all of the couplings are completely unsuppressed. <lb/></body>

			<body> A simple way to forbid W <lb/> (bad)  is to impose matter parity, which is a Z  2  symmetry with <lb/>assignments: <lb/>Superfield <lb/>Matter parity <lb/>quark, lepton χsf <lb/>P  M  = −1 <lb/> Higgs χsf <lb/>P  M  = +1 <lb/>gauge vsf <lb/> P  M  = +1. <lb/>Under these assignments, all terms in W <lb/> (good)  have P  M  = +1 while all terms in <lb/> (bad)  have P  M  = −1. <lb/> One can check that one may write matter parity in terms of baryon and lepton number as <lb/> P  M  = (−) <lb/> 3(B−L)  . <lb/> (2.51) <lb/>A common variation of this is to impose the above constraint using R-parity, <lb/>P  R  = (−) <lb/> 3(B−L)+2s  , <lb/> (2.52) <lb/>where s is the spin of the field. Conservation of matter parity implies conservation of R-parity. This <lb/>is because the (−) <lb/> 2s  factor always cancels in any interaction term since Lorentz invariance requires <lb/>that any such term has an even number of fermions. Observe that all sm fields have R-parity <lb/> +1 while all superpartner fields have R-parity −1. (This is similar to T -parity for Little Higgs <lb/>models.) The diagrams assocaited with electroweak precision observables carry only sm external <lb/>states. Since R-parity requires pair-production of superpartners, this means that electroweak <lb/>precision corrections cannot occur at tree-level and must come from loop diagrams. <lb/>It is important to understand that R-parity (or matter parity) is an additional symmetry that <lb/>we impose on top of supersymmetry. R-parity has some important consequences: <lb/>1. The lightest R-parity odd particle is stable. This is known as the lightest supersymmetric <lb/>particle or lsp. If the lsp is an electrically neutral color singlet—as we shall assume—it is <lb/>a candidate for wimp-like dm. <lb/> 2. Each superpartner (sparticle) other than the lsp will decay. At the end of any such sequence <lb/>of decays one is left with an odd number (usually one) of lsps. <lb/> 3. In collider experiments, the initial state has P  R  = +1 so that only an even number of <lb/>sparticles can be produced at a time (e.g. via pair production). At the end of the decay these <lb/>end up as lsps which manifest themselves as missing energy signals at colliders. <lb/>For most of this document we postulate that the mssm has exact R-parity conservation—though <lb/>this is something of an ad-hoc assumption. <lb/> 2.9 Supersymmetry breaking <lb/> Any scalar partners to the sm leptons or quarks with exactly degenerate masses as their sm partner <lb/>would have been discovered long ago. Thus, the next piece required to construct a realistic mssm <lb/> is a way to break supersymmetry and split the mass degeneracy between the sm particles and <lb/>their superpartners. Since we want to keep the desirable ultraviolet behavior of supersymmetry, <lb/>we assume that susy is a fundamental symmetry of nature which is spontaneously broken. <lb/></body>

We refer to the case F  i  <lb/> = 0 as F -type susy breaking and the case <lb/> D <lb/> = 0 as D-type susy breaking. <lb/>When an ordinary global symmetry is spontaneously broken due to a field picking up a vev <lb/> there exists a massless boson in the spectrum of the theory known as the Goldstone boson. In <lb/>the same way, when susy is broken spontaneously due to a auxiliary field picking up a vev, there <lb/>exists a massless fermion in the theory known as the Goldstino <lb/> 3  . The spin of this field is inherited <lb/>by the spin of the susy generators. Heuristically, the massless Goldstone modes correspond to <lb/>acting on the vev with the broken generators and promoting the transformation parameters to <lb/>fields. Since the susy transformation parameter is fermionic, the Goldstone field must also be <lb/>fermionic. <lb/>For example, if F = 0, then the transformation of the fermion ψ under the broken (susy) <lb/>generator is <lb/> δ   ψ = 2F . <lb/> (2.57) <lb/> susy acts as a shift in the fermion, analogously to the shift symmetry of a Goldstone boson under <lb/>a spontaneously broken global internal symmetry. If there is more than one superfield with a <lb/>non-zero F term, then <lb/> δ   ψ  i  = 2F  i  <lb/> (2.58) <lb/> ψ  Goldstone  = <lb/> i <lb/> F  i <lb/> i  F <lb/> 2 <lb/> i <lb/> ψ  i  . <lb/> (2.59) <lb/>Note that we have used the convention that, when there is no ambiguity, F refers to the susy <lb/> breaking background value, dropping the brackets · · · to avoid clutter. One can further generalize <lb/>this to include a linear combination of gauginos when there is also D-term susy breaking. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 3  This is somewhat unfortunate nomenclature. One would expect the massless mode coming from spontaneously <lb/>broken susy to be called a Goldstone fermion whereas the &apos;Goldstino&apos; should refer to the supersymmetric partner <lb/>of a Goldstone boson coming from the spontaneous breaking of an ordinary symmetry. <lb/></note>

			<body> When ordinary spontaneously broken internal symmetries are promoted to gauge symmetries, <lb/>their Goldstone modes are &apos;eaten&apos; and become the longitudinal polarization of the gauge fields. <lb/>Similarly, gauging supersymmetry corresponds to writing a theory of supergravity. The gravitino <lb/>then becomes massive by eating the Goldstino from spontaneous susy breaking. <lb/> 2.10 Sum rule for broken SUSY <lb/> Even when it is spontaneously broken, susy is a strong constraint on the parameters of a theory. <lb/>One of the most important constraints is the susy sum rule, which relates the traces of the mass <lb/>matrices of particles of different spins. <lb/>First consider the mass terms for chiral fermions (ψ) and gauginos (λ): <lb/> i <lb/> √ <lb/> 2g (T <lb/> a  ) <lb/> i <lb/>j <lb/> ϕ  i  ¯ <lb/> λ <lb/> a  ¯ <lb/> ψ <lb/> j  − ϕ <lb/>  *  λψ <lb/> − <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  W <lb/>∂ϕ  i  ∂ϕ  j <lb/> ψ  i  ψ  j  + h.c. <lb/>(2.60) <lb/>We may write this succinctly as a mass matrix, <lb/> ψ  i  λ  a <lb/> F  ij <lb/> √ <lb/> 2D  bi <lb/> √ <lb/> 2D  aj <lb/> 0 <lb/> ψ  j <lb/> λ  b <lb/> , <lb/> (2.61) <lb/>where we use the shorthand notation <lb/> F  ij  = <lb/> ∂F  i <lb/> ∂ϕ  j <lb/> = <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  W <lb/>∂ϕ  i  ∂ϕ  j <lb/> D  ai  = <lb/> ∂D  a <lb/> ∂ϕ  i <lb/> = gϕ <lb/>  * <lb/> i  T <lb/> a  . <lb/> (2.62) <lb/>Call this fermion mass matrix m <lb/> (j=1/2)  . Next, the scalar mass matrix (m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> (j=0) <lb/> ij <lb/> is obtained by the <lb/>Hessian of the scalar potential, <lb/>  ∂  2  V <lb/>∂ϕ  i  ∂ϕ  * <lb/> j <lb/> ∂  2  V <lb/>∂ϕ  i  ∂ϕ  j <lb/> ∂  2  V <lb/>∂ϕ  * <lb/> i  ∂ϕ  * <lb/> j <lb/> ∂  2  V <lb/>∂ϕ  * <lb/> i  ∂ϕ  j <lb/> = <lb/> ¯ <lb/> F <lb/> ij  F  kj  + D <lb/> i <lb/>a  D  aj  + D <lb/> i <lb/>aj  D  a <lb/> ¯ <lb/> F <lb/> ijk  F  k  + D <lb/> j <lb/>a  D <lb/> j <lb/>a <lb/> F  ijk  ¯ <lb/> F <lb/> k  + D  ai  D  aj <lb/> F  ik  ¯ <lb/> F <lb/> jk  + D  ai  D <lb/> j <lb/>a  + D <lb/> j <lb/>ai  D  a <lb/> . <lb/> (2.63) <lb/>Finally, the gauge boson matrix comes from the kinetic terms <lb/> i <lb/> g <lb/> 2  |A <lb/> a <lb/>µ  T <lb/> aα <lb/>β  φ  iα  | <lb/> 2  = |A <lb/> a <lb/>µ  D <lb/> i <lb/>a  | <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (2.64) <lb/>and may thus be written <lb/>(m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> (j=1) <lb/> ab <lb/> = D <lb/> i <lb/>a  D  bi  + D  ai  D <lb/> i <lb/>b  . <lb/> (2.65) <lb/>The traces of the squared mass matrices are, respectively, <lb/>Tr m <lb/> (j=1/2) <lb/> m <lb/> (j=1/2) <lb/>   †  =F  ij  ¯ <lb/> F <lb/> ij  + 4|D  ai  | <lb/> 2 <lb/> (2.66) <lb/>Tr <lb/> m <lb/> (j=0) <lb/>  2  =2F <lb/> ij  ¯ <lb/> F  ij  + 2D <lb/> i <lb/>a  D  ai  + 2D  a  D <lb/> i <lb/>ai <lb/> (2.67) <lb/>Tr <lb/> m <lb/> (j=1) <lb/>  2  =2D  ai  D <lb/> i <lb/>a  . <lb/> (2.68) <lb/></body>

			<body> For convenience, we may define the supertrace, a sum of the squared mass matrices weighted by <lb/>the number of states, <lb/>STr <lb/> m <lb/> (j) <lb/> 2 ≡ <lb/> j <lb/> Tr (2j + 1)(−) <lb/> 2j  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> (2.69) <lb/>= − 2F ¯ <lb/> F − u|D  ai  | <lb/> 2  + 2F ¯ <lb/> F + 2D <lb/> i <lb/>a  D  ai  + 2D  a  D <lb/> i <lb/>ai  + 3 · 2D  ai  D <lb/> i <lb/>a <lb/> (2.70) <lb/>=2D  a  (D  a  ) <lb/> i <lb/>i <lb/> (2.71) <lb/>=2D <lb/>  a <lb/> i <lb/> q <lb/> ( a) <lb/>i <lb/> (2.72) <lb/>Note that D  a  <lb/> = 0 only for U(1) factors, so (D  a  ) <lb/> i <lb/>i  = <lb/> q  i  , the sum of all U(1) charges. We have <lb/>written  a to index only the U(1) factors of the gauge group. Note, however, that usually <lb/> i <lb/> q <lb/> ( a) <lb/>i <lb/> = 0 <lb/>(2.73) <lb/>due to anomaly cancellation. This leads to the very stringent constraint that <lb/>STr m <lb/> 2  = 0. <lb/>(2.74) <lb/>Note that this is a tree-level result that assumes renormalizable interactions <lb/> 4  . <lb/> 2.11 Soft breaking and the MSSM <lb/> The sum rule (2.74) is a road block to susy model building. To see why, consider the scalar mass <lb/>matrix (2.63) applied to squarks. In order to preserve SU(3)  c  , the squarks should not obtain a <lb/> vev. This implies that the D-terms vanish, D <lb/> i <lb/>a  = D  color  = 0, for squarks. Thus further means <lb/>that quarks only get their masses from the superpotential. <lb/>Similarly preserving U(1)  EM  implies that the D-terms corresponding to the electrically charged <lb/>SU(2)  L  directions should also vanish: D  ±  = D  1,2  = 0. This means that the only D-terms which <lb/>are allowed to be non-trivial are D  3  and D  Y  , corresponding to the third generator of SU (2)  L  and <lb/>hypercharge. The scalar mass matrix for the up-type quarks is then <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/>2/3  = <lb/> m  2/3  m <lb/>  † <lb/> 2/3  + <lb/>  1 <lb/>2 <lb/> gD  3  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>6 <lb/> g <lb/>  D  Y <lb/>  1 <lb/> ∆ <lb/>∆ <lb/>  † <lb/> m  2/3  m <lb/>  † <lb/> 2/3  − <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/> g <lb/>  D  Y 1 <lb/> (2.75) <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/>1/3  = <lb/> m  1/3  m <lb/>  † <lb/> 1/3  + <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> gD  3  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>6 <lb/> g <lb/>  D  Y <lb/>  1 <lb/> ∆ <lb/> ∆ <lb/>  † <lb/> m  1/3  m <lb/>  † <lb/> 1/3  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>3 <lb/> g <lb/>  D  Y 1 <lb/> , <lb/> (2.76) <lb/>where the ∆ and ∆ <lb/>  are the appropriate expressions from (2.63) and m  2/3,1/3  correspond to the <lb/>quadratic terms in the superpotential that contribute to the quark masses. <lb/>Charge conservation requires the sum of D terms to vanish, so that at least one D term is less <lb/>than or equal to zero. For example, suppose that <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> gD  3  + <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/> g <lb/>  D  Y  ≤ 0. <lb/>(2.77) <lb/></body>

			<body> Let β be the direction in field space corresponding to the up quark. Then β is an eigenvector of <lb/>the quark mass matrix m  2/3  with eigenvalue m  u  . Then (2.77) implies that <lb/> β <lb/>  †  0 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/>2/3 <lb/> β <lb/> 0 <lb/> ≤ m <lb/> 2 <lb/> u  . <lb/> (2.78) <lb/>This implies that there exists a squark in the spectrum that has a tree-level mass less than the up <lb/>quark. Such an object would have been discovered long ago and is ruled out. <lb/>More generally, the observation that there is at least one negative D-term combined with the <lb/>form of the squark matrices (2.75) and (2.76) implies that there must exist a squark with mass less <lb/>than or equal to either m  u  or m  d  . Thus even if susy is broken, it appears that any supersymmetric <lb/>version of the Standard Model is doomed to be ruled out at tree level. <lb/>In order to get around this restriction, one typically breaks susy in a separate supersymmetry <lb/> breaking sector ($  $ $ <lb/> susy) that is not charged under the Standard Model gauge group. This  $ $ $ <lb/> susy <lb/> sector still obeys a sum rule of the form (2.74) but the spectrum is no longer constrained by <lb/>observed sm particles. In order for the  $ $ $ <lb/> susy sector to lend masses to the sm superpartners, one <lb/>assumes the existence of a messenger sector which interacts with both the sm and the  $ $ $ <lb/> susy <lb/> sectors. The messenger sector transmits the susy-breaking auxiliary field vev to the sm sector <lb/>and allows the sm superpartners to become massive without violating the sum rule (2.74). Note <lb/>that this also allows a large degree of agnosticism about the details of the  $ $ $ <lb/> susy sector—as far as <lb/>the phenomenology of the mssm is concerned, we only need to know about the  $ $ $ <lb/> susy scale and the <lb/>properties of the messenger sector. <lb/>There are two standard types of assumptions for the messenger sector depending on how one <lb/>assumes it couples to the sm: <lb/> • Gravity mediation: here one assumes that the sm and  $ $ $ <lb/> susy breaking sectors only com-<lb/>municate gravitationally. The details of these interactions fall under the theory of local <lb/>supersymmetry, or supergravity (sugra), but are typically not necessary for collider phe-<lb/>nomenology. <lb/> • Gauge mediation: The messenger sector contains fields which are charged under the sm <lb/> gauge group. <lb/>An alternative way around the  $ $ $ <lb/> susy sum rule is to construct a &apos;single sector&apos; model based on <lb/>strong coupling [17,18]. These turn out to be dual to 5D models of susy breaking using tools that <lb/>we introduce in Section 3. <lb/>Often we are only interested in the properties of the Standard Model particles and their super-<lb/>partners. We can &apos;integrate out&apos; the details of the messenger sector and parameterize susy breaking <lb/>into non-renormalizable interactions. As an example, suppose that a superfield, X, breaks super-<lb/>symmetry by picking up an F -term vev: X = · · · + F θ <lb/> 2  . X may also have a scalar vev, but <lb/>this does not break susy. We then parameterize the types of non-renormalizable couplings that <lb/>are generated when we integrate out the messenger sector. We have four types of terms: <lb/>1. Non-holomorphic scalar masses are generated by higher order Kähler potential terms <lb/>such as <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ <lb/>X <lb/>  †  X <lb/>M  2  Φ <lb/>  †  Φ = <lb/> F <lb/>M <lb/>  2 <lb/> ϕ <lb/>  *  ϕ + (susy preserving terms). <lb/>(2.79) <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ <lb/>X + X <lb/>  † <lb/> M <lb/> Φ <lb/>  †  Φ = <lb/> F <lb/>  * <lb/> M <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ Φ <lb/>  †  Φ + h.c. + (susy preserving terms). <lb/>(2.80) <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body> We have written (2.80) to appear suggestively like a non-holomorphic superpotential term. <lb/>This, however, is a susy-breaking term and so does not violate the holomorphy of the <lb/>superpotential imposed by susy. <lb/> The mass scale M is required by dimensional analysis and is naturally the scale of the <lb/>mediator sector that has been integrated out. For gravity mediation M ∼ M  Pl  while for <lb/>gauge mediation M ∼ M  mess  , the mass of the messenger fields. Doing the Grassmann <lb/>integral and picking the terms that depend on the susy breaking order parameter F gives a <lb/>mass m <lb/> 2  = (F/M ) <lb/> 2  to the scalar ϕ. Note that F has dimension 2 so that this term has the <lb/>correct mass dimension. <lb/>2. Holomorphic scalar masses are generated by a similar higher order Kähler potential term, <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ <lb/>X <lb/>  †  X <lb/>M  2 <lb/> Φ <lb/> 2  + <lb/> Φ <lb/>  † <lb/>  2  <lb/> = <lb/> F <lb/>M <lb/>  2 <lb/> ϕ <lb/> 2  + ϕ <lb/>  * 2 <lb/> + (susy preserving terms). <lb/>(2.81) <lb/>These are often called b-terms. One may want to instead write these masses at lower order in <lb/> F by writing a superpotential term W ⊃ XΦ <lb/> 2  . This, however, is a renormalizable interaction <lb/>that does not separate the  $ $ $ <lb/> susy sector from the visible sector—as one can see the mediator <lb/>mass does not appear explicitly in such a term. Thus W ⊃ XΦ <lb/> 2  is subject to the susy sum <lb/>rule and is not the type of soft term we want for the mssm. <lb/> 3. Holomorphic cubic scalar interactions are generated from the superpotential, <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ <lb/>X <lb/>M <lb/> Φ <lb/> 3  + h.c. = <lb/> F <lb/>M <lb/> ϕ <lb/> 3  + ϕ <lb/>  * 3 <lb/> + (susy preserving terms). <lb/>(2.82) <lb/>These are called A-terms and are the same order as the scalar mass. <lb/>4. Gaugino masses are generated from corrections to the gauge kinetic term, <lb/> d <lb/> 2  θ <lb/>X <lb/>M <lb/> W  α  W <lb/> α  + h.c. = <lb/> F <lb/>M <lb/>λλ + h.c. + (susy preserving terms). <lb/>(2.83) <lb/>This is a gaugino mass on the same order as the scalar mass and the A-term. <lb/> In principle one could also generate tadpole terms for visible sector fields, but we shall ignore this <lb/>case and assume that all field are expanded about their minimum. These four types of terms are <lb/>known as soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The key point is that these do not reintroduce <lb/>any quadratic uv sensitivity in the masses of any scalars. This is clear since above the susy <lb/> breaking mediation scale M , the theory is supersymmetric and these divergences cancel. <lb/>It is common to simply parameterize the soft breaking terms of the mssm in the Lagrangian: <lb/> L  soft  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> M  3  <lb/> g g + M  2  <lb/> W <lb/> W + M  1  <lb/> B <lb/> B <lb/> + h.c. <lb/>(2.84) <lb/> − <lb/> a  u  <lb/> QH  u  ¯ <lb/> u + a  d  <lb/> QH  d <lb/>  ¯ <lb/> d + a  e  <lb/> LH  d  ¯ <lb/> e <lb/> + h.c. <lb/>(2.85) <lb/> − <lb/> Q <lb/>  †  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Q <lb/> Q − <lb/> L <lb/>  †  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> L <lb/> L − <lb/> u <lb/>  †  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> u <lb/>  ¯ <lb/> u − <lb/> d <lb/>  †  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> d <lb/>  ¯ <lb/> d − <lb/> e <lb/>  †  m <lb/> 2 <lb/> e <lb/>  ¯ <lb/> e − m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  H <lb/>  * <lb/> u  H  u  − m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> H <lb/>  * <lb/> d  H  d <lb/> (2.86) <lb/> − (bH  u  H  d  + h.c.)) . <lb/> (2.87) <lb/>This is simply a reparameterization of the types of soft terms described in (2.79 – 2.83), from <lb/>which one can read off the scaling of each coefficient with respect to F/M . <lb/></body>

			<body> Note that the trilinear soft terms, a  u,d,e  , and the soft masses m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Q,L,u,d,e  are 3 × 3 matrices in <lb/>flavor space. The trilinear terms are in a one-to-one correspondence with the Yukawa matrices <lb/>except that they represent a coupling between three scalars. In general, the soft masses cause the <lb/>squarks and sleptons to have different mass eigenstates than the sm fermions. <lb/>Phenomenologically, we assume that <lb/> M  1,2,3  , a  u,d,e  ∼ m  susy <lb/> (2.88) <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Q,u,d,L,e,Hu,H  d <lb/> , b ∼ m <lb/> 2 <lb/> susy  , <lb/> (2.89) <lb/>where m  susy  is between a few hundreds of gev to a tev. This is the range in which generic <lb/> mssm-like models provide a solution to the Hierarchy problem. <lb/> R-symmetry, gauginos, supersymmetry breaking. Recall that when an R-symmetry exists, the different <lb/>components of a superfield carry different R charges. Because the O(θ) component of W <lb/> α  , F  µν  , is real, it <lb/>cannot carry an R charge. This means that the lowest component, the gaugino λ, must have non-zero R-<lb/> charge. Further, the gaugino mass term (2.83) breaks this symmetry. One will find that R-symmetry plays an <lb/>important role in many non-perturbative results in susy. Two important results related to susy breaking and <lb/>gaugino masses are [19, 20]. <lb/> 2.12 Electroweak symmetry breaking in the MSSM <lb/> The most important feature of the Standard Model is electroweak symmetry breaking. Recall that <lb/>this is due to a tachyonic Higgs mass at the origin being balanced by a positive quartic coupling <lb/>leading to a non-zero vacuum expectation value. In the mssm we have two Higgs doublets, <lb/> H  u  = <lb/> H <lb/> + <lb/> u <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u <lb/> H  d  = <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d <lb/> H <lb/> − <lb/> d <lb/> . <lb/> (2.90) <lb/>We have already seen that supersymmetry relates the scalar quartic coupling to the other couplings <lb/>of the theory. This then constrains the expected Higgs boson mass. <lb/>To preserve SU(3)  c  and U(1)  EM  we assume that no squarks or sleptons pick up vevs. Then <lb/>the quartic terms in the Higgs potential come from D-terms, (2.56): <lb/> V  D  = <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/> H <lb/>  † <lb/> u  σ <lb/> a  H  u  + H <lb/>  † <lb/> d  σ <lb/> a  H  d <lb/> H <lb/>  † <lb/> u  σ <lb/> a  H  u  + H <lb/>  † <lb/> d  σ <lb/> a  H  d <lb/> + <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/> |H  u  | <lb/> 2  − |H  d  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> g <lb/> 2  |H <lb/>  † <lb/> u  H  d  | <lb/> 2  + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/>(g <lb/> 2  + g <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> |H  u  | <lb/> 2  − |H  d  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2  , <lb/> (2.91) <lb/>where we have simplified the SU(2)  L  terms using the relation σ <lb/> a <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> a <lb/>k  = 2δ  ii  δ  jk  − δ  ij  δ  k  . We see <lb/>immediately that the Higgs quartic λ coupling goes like the squared electroweak couplings, g <lb/> 2  and <lb/> g <lb/> 2  . This connection between the Higgs sector and the gauge parameters does not exist in the <lb/>Standard Model <lb/>In addition to the D-term contribution, there is also the supersymmetric F -term contribution <lb/>coming from the µ-term in the superpotential.

			<body> terms. These include soft masses for each Higgs doublet and a &apos;holomorphic&apos; b-term which is called <lb/> B  µ  (or sometimes Bµ), <lb/>V  soft  = m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  |H  u  | <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> |H  d  | <lb/> 2  + (B  µ  H  u  · H  d  + h.c.) . <lb/> (2.93) <lb/>Note that the contraction of H  u  and H  d  in the D-term (2.91) is different from that in the B  µ  term <lb/>(2.95). Specifically, H  u  · H  d  is contracted using the  ab  tensor and gives H <lb/> + <lb/> u  H <lb/> − <lb/> d  − H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  . Further, <lb/>the D-term couplings are real since they are part of a real superfield. The F -term couplings are <lb/>made real because they are the modulus of a complex parameter. The couplings of the soft terms, <lb/>on the other hand, carry arbitrary sign and phase. <lb/>Combining all of these factors, the full Higgs potential is <lb/> V  H  = V  D  + V  F  + V  soft <lb/> (2.94) <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> g <lb/> 2  |H <lb/>  † <lb/> u  H  d  | <lb/> 2  + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/>(g <lb/> 2  + g <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> |H  u  | <lb/> 2  − |H  d  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> + <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu <lb/> |H  u  | <lb/> 2  + <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu <lb/> |H  d  | <lb/> 2  + (B  µ  H  u  · H  d  + h.c.) . <lb/> (2.95) <lb/>To simplify this, we can assume that the charged components of the doublets pick up no vev <lb/> and write everything in terms of only the neutral components (we address the validity of this <lb/>assumption below): <lb/> V  H  = <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/>(g <lb/> 2  + g <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  | <lb/> 2  − |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  | <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2  + <lb/> i=u,d <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  i <lb/> |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> i  | <lb/> 2  − 2B  µ  Re(H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  ). <lb/>(2.96) <lb/>Observe that this potential has a direction in field space, |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  | <lb/> 2  = |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  | <lb/> 2  where the D-term quartic <lb/>vanishes. This is called a D-flat direction and requires caution. In order to break electroweak <lb/>symmetry, we must destabilize the origin of field space with a tachyonic mass term to force a linear <lb/>combination of the neutral Higgses to pick up a vev. In the sm destabilization is balanced by <lb/>the quartic coupling which forces the vev to take a finite value. We see now in the mssm that <lb/>one has to take special care to make sure that the destabilized direction does not align with the <lb/> D-flat direction or else the potential isn&apos;t bounded from below. In other words, we must impose a <lb/>negative mass squared in one direction in the Higgs moduli space while making sure that there is <lb/>a positive definite mass squared along the D-flat direction. This can be written as two conditions: <lb/>1. We require exactly one negative eigenvalue in the neutral Higgs mass matrix, <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu <lb/> −B  µ <lb/> −B  µ <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> = <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> − B <lb/> 2 <lb/> µ  &lt; 0. <lb/>(2.97) <lb/>2. The mass squared term is positive when |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  | = |H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  |. For simplicity, suppose B  µ  , H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  , and <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  are all real (see below). Then this imposes <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu <lb/> + <lb/> |µ| <lb/> 2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> + 2B  µ  &gt; 0. <lb/>(2.98) <lb/>The conditions (2.97) and (2.98) are the requirements for electroweak symmetry breaking in the <lb/> mssm. <lb/> Note that a natural choice for the soft masses, m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  = m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> , does not obey the restrictions <lb/>(2.97) and (2.98). One way to nevertheless enforce this relation is to impose it as a boundary <lb/></body>

This is actually quite reasonable, since the β-function for these soft masses include terms <lb/>that go like the squared Yukawa coupling. The two soft masses flow differently due to the large <lb/>difference in the top and bottom Yukawas. In fact, the up-type Higgs mass parameter shrinks in <lb/>the ir and it is natural to assume <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  &lt; m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> . <lb/> (2.99) <lb/>A convenient choice is m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  &lt; 0 and m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> &gt; 0. In this way the mssm naturally admits radiative <lb/> electroweak symmetry breaking where the tachyonic direction at the origin is generated by <lb/>quantum effects. <lb/>Sine there are many parameters floating around, it use useful to summarize that the following <lb/>all prefer electroweak symmetry breaking and no runaway directions: <lb/> • Relatively large B  µ <lb/> • Relatively small µ <lb/> • Negative m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  . <lb/>Be aware that these are only rough guidelines and are neither necessary nor sufficient. <lb/>It is standard to parameterize the vevs of the two Higgses relative to the sm Higgs vev by <lb/>introducing an angle, β, <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  = <lb/> v  u <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/>= <lb/> v <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/>sin β <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  = <lb/> v  d <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/>= <lb/> v <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/>cos β. <lb/> (2.100) <lb/>Minimizing the potential, ∂V /∂H <lb/> 0 <lb/> u  = ∂V /∂H <lb/> 0 <lb/> d  = 0, one obtains <lb/>sin 2β = <lb/>2B  µ <lb/> 2|µ|  2  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> (2.101) <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z <lb/> 2 <lb/>= −|µ| <lb/> 2  + <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  d <lb/> − m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  tan <lb/> 2  β <lb/> tan <lb/> 2  β − 1 <lb/> . <lb/> (2.102) <lb/>The second relation is especially strange: it connects the supersymmetric µ term to the soft-<lb/>breaking masses, even though these come from totally different sectors of the theory. In other <lb/>words, unlike the quartic and gauge couplings which are tied together by supersymmetry, these <lb/>parameters have no reason to have any particular relation with each other. Further, M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z  is ex-<lb/>perimentally measured and much smaller than the typical expectation for either µ or m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  u,d <lb/> , so it <lb/>appears that there&apos;s some cancellation going on. <lb/>The Higgs sector of the mssm contains the usual cp-even Higgs h, a heavier cp-even Higgs, <lb/>the Goldstones of electroweak symmetry breaking, an additional pair of charged Higgses H <lb/> ±  , and <lb/>a cp-odd Higgs A.

			<body> For m <lb/>  t  = 1.2 tev and Λ  UV  = 10 <lb/> 16  this balancing act between m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu  and M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z  /2 requires a fine tuning <lb/>of <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z  /2 <lb/> ∆m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Hu <lb/> ∼ 0.1%. <lb/>Physically what&apos;s happening is that the stop plays a key role in naturalness by canceling the <lb/>sensitivity to the uv scale. By pushing the stop to be heavier to increase the Higgs quartic, one <lb/>reintroduces quadratic sensitivity up to the scale of the stop mass. This is known as the little <lb/> hierarchy problem of the mssm. <lb/> 2.14 SUSY breaking versus flavor <lb/> The soft breaking Lagrangian introduces many new masses, phases, and mixing angles on top of <lb/>those found in the Standard Model for a total of 124 parameters [23]. Most of this huge parameter <lb/>space, however, is already excluded from flavor and cp violating processes. Recall that in the <lb/> sm, there are no tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents (fcnc) and loop-level contributions <lb/>are suppressed by the gim mechanism. Lepton number violation is similarly strongly suppressed. <lb/>In the limit where the Yukawa couplings vanish, y → 0, the Standard Model has a U(3) <lb/> 5  flavor <lb/>symmetry where each of the five types of matter particles are equivalent. This flavor symmetry <lb/>is presumably broken at some scale Λ  F  in such a way that the only imprint of this uv physics at <lb/>scales well below Λ  F  are the Yukawa matrices. This flavor scale can be very large so that effects <lb/>of this flavor breaking go like 1/Λ  F  and are plausibly very small. <lb/>In the mssm, one must further check that the flavor breaking dynamics has already &apos;frozen <lb/>out&apos; at the susy breaking scale so that the only non-trivial flavor structure in the susy breaking <lb/>parameters are the Yukawa matrices themselves. This means we would like the mediator scale M <lb/> to be below the flavor scale, M  Λ  F  . In gravity mediation, however, Λ  med  = M  Pl  , and we can no <lb/>longer guarantee that the susy breaking mediators are insulated from flavor violating dynamics. <lb/>This leads to strong constraints on the flavor structure of the mssm soft parameters. <lb/>For example, consider one of the most carefully studied fcnc processes, kaon anti-kaon (K-¯ <lb/> K) <lb/> mixing. The quark content of the mesons are K = d¯ s and ¯ <lb/> K = ¯ <lb/> ds. In the sm this process is <lb/>mediated by diagrams such as <lb/> d <lb/>s <lb/>s <lb/>d <lb/>W <lb/>W <lb/>u  i <lb/> u  j <lb/> Each vertex picks up a factor of the ckm matrix. The gim observation is the fact that the unitarity <lb/>of the ckm matrix imposes an additional suppression. In the mssm, on the other hand, the squark <lb/>soft masses introduce an additional source of flavor violation so that the quark and squark mass <lb/>matrices are misaligned. This manifests itself as flavor-changing mass insertions, ∆m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ds  , on squark <lb/>propagators when written in terms of the Standard Model mass eigenstate combinations: <lb/></body>

This is the SUSY flavor problem: a generic flavor structure for the <lb/> mssm soft parameters is phenomenologically ruled out. We are led to conclude that the off-diagonal <lb/>flavor terms must be strongly suppressed to avoid experimental bounds. <lb/>One way to do this is to suppose an organizing principle in the susy breaking parameters, <lb/> soft-breaking universality, <lb/> 1. Soft breaking masses are all universal for all particles at some high scale. This means that <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> Q  ∝ 1  in flavor space, and similarly for each mssm matter multiplet. <lb/>2. If a-terms are not flavor-universal, then the Higgs vev induces similar problematic mixings, <lb/> L  a  = a <lb/> u <lb/>ij  Q  i  ¯ <lb/> U  j  H  u  + a <lb/> d <lb/>ij  Q  i  ¯ <lb/> D  j  H  d  + a <lb/> e <lb/>ij  L  i  ¯ <lb/> E  j  H  d  . <lb/> (2.110) <lb/>To avoid this, assume that a <lb/> I <lb/>ij  is proportional to the Yukawa matrix, <lb/> a <lb/> I <lb/>ij  = A <lb/> I  y <lb/> I <lb/>ij  . <lb/> (2.111) <lb/>This way, the rotation that diagonalizes the sm fermions also diagonalizes their scalar part-<lb/>ners. <lb/> 3. To avoid cp violation, assume that all non-trivial phases beyond those in the Standard Model <lb/> ckm matrix vanish. <lb/>These are phenomenological principles. Ultimately, one would like to explain why these properties <lb/>should be true (or at least approximately so). <lb/></body>

			<body> 2.15 Gauge mediated SUSY breaking <lb/> One straightforward realization of soft-breaking universality is to have the messenger sector be <lb/>flavor universal. A natural way to do this is gauge mediation since the sm gauge fields are blind <lb/>to flavor [24–27]. See [28] for a review. <lb/> $ $ $ <lb/> susy <lb/> messenger <lb/> mssm <lb/> F  X  <lb/> = 0 <lb/>Φ  i  , ¯ <lb/>Φ  i <lb/> sm gauge <lb/> The main idea is that the susy breaking sector has some superfield (or collection of superfields) <lb/> X which pick up F -term vevs, F  X  <lb/> = 0. This generates mass splittings in the messenger sector <lb/>superfields, Φ  i  and ¯ <lb/>Φ  i  . These messengers obey the tree-level susy sum rules discussed above but <lb/>are not problematic since all of the components can be made heavy. One then assumes that the <lb/>messengers are charged under the sm gauge group so that the mssm superfields will feel the effects <lb/>of susy breaking through loops that include the messenger fields. Note that anomaly cancellation <lb/>of the sm gauge group typically requires the messenger superfields to appear in vector-like pairs, <lb/>Φ and ¯ <lb/>Φ with opposite sm quantum numbers. <lb/>The messenger fields generate non-renormalizable operators that connect the mssm and the <lb/> susy breaking sector without introducing any flavor dependence for the soft masses. Further, <lb/>because the messenger scale is adjustable, one can always stay in regime where it is parametrically <lb/>smaller than the flavor scale M  Λ  F  . Recall the estimates in Section 2.11 for the size of the <lb/> mssm soft terms. For gauge mediation, M is the mass of the messenger sector fields Φ  i  and ¯ <lb/>Φ  i <lb/> and F is the susy breaking vev, F  X  . Below M we integrate out the messengers to generate the <lb/> mssm soft parameters. <lb/>The simplest realization of this is minimal gauge mediation. Here one assumes only one <lb/> susy breaking field X and N  m  mediators, Φ  i  and ¯ <lb/>Φ  i  , in the fundamental representation of an <lb/>SU(5) gut. The superpotential coupling between these sectors is <lb/> W = ¯ <lb/>ΦXΦ. <lb/>(2.112) <lb/>The contribution to the potential is <lb/> ∂W <lb/>∂Φ <lb/> 2 <lb/> = ||X| <lb/> 2  |ϕ| <lb/> 2  + ||X| <lb/> 2  | ¯ <lb/> ϕ| <lb/> 2  + ϕ ¯ <lb/> ϕF  X  <lb/> (2.113) <lb/>The messenger masses are <lb/> m  ψ  = X <lb/> (2.114) <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ϕ  = X <lb/> 2  ± F  X  , <lb/> (2.115) <lb/>using the notation where the angle brackets · · · are dropped when it is clear that we are referring <lb/>to the vev of a field. Observe that the messenger scale is set by the lowest component vev of <lb/>the susy breaking parameter, M = X. In what follows we make the typical assumption that <lb/> F/M <lb/> 2  1. Note that these masses satisfy the susy sum rule. <lb/>Now let&apos;s consider the spectrum arising from this simple set up. The gauginos of the sm gauge <lb/>group pick up a mass contribution from diagrams of the form <lb/></body>

			<body> F  X  <lb/>X <lb/> ψ¯  Φ <lb/> ψ  Φ <lb/> ¯ <lb/> ϕ <lb/>ϕ <lb/>λ <lb/>λ <lb/> The X insertion on the ψ  Φ  line is required to flip the gaugino helicity (recall that arrows on <lb/>fermion indicate helicity). The F insertion on the ϕ line is required to connect to susy breaking <lb/>so that this is indeed a mass contribution that is not accessible to the gauge boson. The F vev <lb/> is also required to flip from a ϕ to a ¯ <lb/> ϕ so that the scalar of the chiral superfield picks up a sense <lb/>of chirality as well. Using powerful methods based on holomporphy [29, 30], the gaugino mass for <lb/>the i <lb/> th  gauge factor is <lb/> M  λ  i  = <lb/> F M <lb/>M  2 <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> i <lb/> 16π  2  N  m  = <lb/> α  i <lb/> 4π <lb/> N  m <lb/> F <lb/>M <lb/>. <lb/> (2.116) <lb/>This expression—which one could have guessed from a back-of-the-envelope estimate—turns out <lb/>to be exact to leading order in F/M <lb/> 2  . This is a reflection of the powerful renormalization theorems <lb/>in supersymmetry, see e.g. [31]. One of the concrete predictions of minimal gauge mediation is the <lb/>relation <lb/> M  λ  1  : M  λ  2  : M  λ  3  = α  1  : α  2  : α  3  . <lb/> (2.117) <lb/>The heaviest superpartners are those which couple to the largest rank gauge group. <lb/>The scalar partners of the sm matter particles do not directly couple to the messengers. Thus <lb/>the masses for the squarks and sleptons must be generated at two loop level. There are many <lb/>diagrams that include loops of both the messenger scalar and fermion: <lb/> ϕ <lb/>ψ <lb/>ϕ <lb/>ϕ <lb/>ϕ <lb/>ψ <lb/>ϕ <lb/>ϕ <lb/> The loops either include a gauge boson or otherwise use the scalar quartic D-term interaction <lb/>between messengers and sfermions. The result is that the soft scalar masses go like <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/>soft  ∼ <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> 16π  2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> N  m <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/> M  2  C  i  , <lb/> (2.118) <lb/>where C  i  is the relevant quadratic casimir. Observe that m <lb/> 2 <lb/>soft  ∼ m <lb/> 2 <lb/> λ  so that the sfermions which <lb/>couple to the higher rank gauge factors pick up more mass. Including the various gauge charges <lb/></body>

Requiring that the superpartner masses are around the electroweak <lb/>scale sets <lb/> F <lb/>M <lb/> ∼ 100 TeV. <lb/>(2.120) <lb/>Note that since the messengers interact with the sm superfields only through gauge interactions, <lb/>the holomorphic soft terms (A and B terms) are typically very small in gauge mediation. <lb/>One important phenomenological consequence of gauge mediation is that the lightest super-<lb/>symmetric partner (lsp) is not one of the mssm fields but rather the gravitino whose mass is [28], <lb/> m  3/2  ∼ <lb/> F <lb/> √ <lb/> 3M  Pl <lb/> ∼ <lb/> √ <lb/> F <lb/> 100 TeV <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2.4 eV. <lb/>(2.121) <lb/>Thus the gravitino is much lighter than the electroweak scale, but is also similarly weakly coupled. <lb/>The relevant couplings at low energies are not gravitational, but rather through the Goldstino <lb/>component of the gravitino. This coupling is proportional to the susy breaking vev F . Because <lb/>of R-parity, any supersymmetric partner produced in the mssm will eventually decay into the next-<lb/>to-lightest superpartner (nlsp). This nlsp must eventually decay into the gravitino lsp since it <lb/>is the only decay mode available. When <lb/> √ <lb/> F  10 <lb/> 6  GeV, the nlsp is so long lived that on collider <lb/>scales it behaves effectively like the lsp. On the other hand, if <lb/> √ <lb/> F  10 <lb/> 6  GeV, the nlsp decays <lb/>within the detector. This gives a fairly unique signal with displaced photons and missing energy <lb/>if the nlsp is the bino, <lb/> B. <lb/> 2.16 The µ–B  µ  problem of gauge mediation <lb/> Let&apos;s return to an issue we addressed earlier when discussing electroweak symmetry breaking. We <lb/>wrote two relations (2.101 – 2.102) satisfied at the minimum of the Higgs potential. We noted <lb/>the µ-problem associated with (2.102): µ and m <lb/> 2 <lb/> H  u,d <lb/> seem to come from different sectors of the <lb/>theory but must conspire to be roughly the same scale. In principle, since µ is a supersymmetric <lb/>dimensionful parameter (the only one in the mssm), it could take a value on the order of the Planck <lb/>mass. We now present a solution to the µ-problem, but we shall see that this solution will cause <lb/>problems in gauge mediation due to the second relation, (2.101). <lb/>One way to address this µ-problem is to forbid it in the supersymmetric limit and then assume <lb/>that it is generated through the susy breaking sector. For example, a global Peccei-Quinn (pq) <lb/>symmetry, <lb/> H  u  →e <lb/> iα  H  u <lb/> (2.122) <lb/> H  d  →e <lb/> iα  H  d  , <lb/> (2.123) <lb/>prohibits the µ term in the superpotential. Gravity, however, is believed to explicitly break global <lb/>symmetries. Indeed, gravity mediation of susy breaking will produce a µ term. Consider, for <lb/></body>

			<body> example, the higher order Kähler potential term that couples the susy breaking superfield X to <lb/>the Higgses [34], <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ <lb/>X <lb/>  †  H  u  · H  d <lb/> M  Pl <lb/> + h.c. <lb/>(2.124) <lb/>When X ∼ θ <lb/> 2  F , one generates an effective µ term of order µ ∼ F/M  Pl  . This neatly addresses <lb/>the µ-problem and ties the µ term to the susy breaking masses. The B  µ  term that is generated <lb/>comes from <lb/> d <lb/> 4  θ <lb/>X <lb/>  †  XH  u  · H  d <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/>Pl <lb/> (2.125) <lb/>and thus is of the same order as µ <lb/> 2  . This is consistent with the observation in (2.101) that B  µ  , µ, <lb/> and the soft breaking terms seem to want to be the same order. We remark that this is no longer <lb/>true in gauge mediation since F  10 <lb/> 11  GeV, the µ and B  µ  terms generated from gravitational <lb/>breaking are far too small. This must be addressed separately in such theories. <lb/> 2.17 Variations beyond the MSSM <lb/> The mssm is under pressure from the lhc. For a review of the status after Run I of the lhc, <lb/> see [35]. There are two main issues: <lb/>1. The Higgs mass m  h  = 125 GeV is hard to achieve in the mssm since it requires a large <lb/>radiative correction to the tree level upper bound of m  h  = M  Z  . <lb/>2. There are no signs of superpartners. With the simplest assumption that m <lb/> q  ∼ m <lb/> g  , the lhc <lb/> pushes the scale of colored superpartners to be over 1.2 tev. This appears to no longer be <lb/>natural. <lb/>In this section we present some model-building directions that the lhc data may be suggesting. <lb/> 2.17.1 Additional D-term contributions <lb/> One simple direction to increase the tree-level Higgs mass is to add extra D-terms to increase the <lb/>Higgs quartic coupling [36–40]. This requires charging the Higgs under an additional U(1)  X  gauge <lb/>group which one must break above the weak scale. This technique is able to indeed push the <lb/>tree-level Higgs mass up to the observed value, but one is constrained by changes to Higgs decay <lb/>branching ratios, particularly h → b ¯ b [41, 42]. <lb/> 2.17.2 The NMSSM <lb/> At the cost of adding an additional singlet superfield S to the mssm sector, one may solve the µ <lb/> problem and also raise the Higgs mass by enhancing its quartic coupling [43–47]. The Higgs sector <lb/>superpotential for this &quot; next-to-minimal &quot; supersymmetric sm (nmssm, see [48, 49] for reviews) is <lb/> W  NMSSM  = y  u  H  u  Q ¯ <lb/> U + y  d  H  d  Q ¯ <lb/> D + y  e  H  d  ¯ <lb/> E + λSH  u  H  d  + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> κS <lb/> 3  . <lb/> (2.126) <lb/>The κ term breaks the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, (2.122 – 2.123), to a Z  3  . Since S is a gauge singlet, <lb/>the D-term potential is unchanged from (2.91). Note, however, that there is no longer a µ term <lb/></body>

Thus the F -term potential <lb/>differs from that of the mssm, (2.92), and is instead <lb/> V  F,nmssm  = λ <lb/> 2  |S| <lb/> 2 <lb/> |H  u  | <lb/> 2  + |H  d  | <lb/> 2 <lb/> + λ <lb/> 2  |H  u  H  d  | <lb/> 2  . <lb/> (2.127) <lb/>We observe that the combination λS plays the role of an effective µ term and solves the µ-<lb/> problem. Finally, there are additional soft terms allowed which augment V  soft  in (2.93), <lb/>∆V  soft,nmssm  = m <lb/> 2 <lb/> S  |S| <lb/> 2  + λA  λ  (SH  u  H  d  + h.c.) + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> κA  κ  (S <lb/> 3  + h.c.). <lb/>(2.128) <lb/>The resulting expression for the Higgs mass is approximately <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> h  ≈ M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z  cos <lb/> 2  2β + λ <lb/> 2  v <lb/> 2  sin <lb/> 2  2β − <lb/> λ <lb/> 2  v <lb/> 2 <lb/> κ  2  (λ − κ sin 2β) <lb/> 2  + <lb/>3m <lb/> 4 <lb/> t <lb/> 4π  2  v  2 <lb/> ln <lb/> m <lb/>  t <lb/> m  t <lb/> + <lb/> A <lb/> 2 <lb/> t <lb/> m <lb/>  t <lb/> 1 − <lb/> A <lb/> 2 <lb/> t <lb/> 12m <lb/>  t <lb/> . <lb/> (2.129) <lb/>This can be larger than the value in the mssm depending on the value of λ. There are limits on <lb/>the size of λ coming from perturbativity, but lifting the Higgs mass to 125 gev is fine. The singlet <lb/> S contributes an additional complex scalar to the Higgs sector and an additional neutralino. <lb/> 2.17.3 Natural SUSY <lb/> The simplest choices for the mssm parameters—those that treat all the flavors universally, as <lb/>preferred by the flavor problem—are tightly constrained by the non-observation of new physics <lb/>at the lhc. Because the lhc is a proton-proton collider, it is easy for it to produce colored <lb/>superpartners such as squarks and gluinos. These, in turn, are expected to show up as events with <lb/>many jets and missing energy as the heavy colored states decay into the lsp. The fact that no <lb/>significant excesses have been found pushes one to consider other parts of the large mssm parameter <lb/>space. <lb/>Instead of biasing our parameter preferences by simplicity, one may take a different approach <lb/>and ask what is the minimal sparticle content required for naturalness? In other words, which <lb/>superpartners are absolutely required to cancel quadratic divergences? Once these are identified, <lb/>one may decouple the remaining sparticles and check the experimental constraints on the resulting <lb/>spectrum. The ingredients of a &apos;minimally&apos; natural mssm spectrum are [50, 51] (see [52–55] for a <lb/>re-examination from the early lhc run) <lb/> 1. Light stops. The largest sm contribution to the Higgs quadratic uv sensitivity is the top <lb/>loop. Naturalness thus requires that its superpartner, the stop, is also accessible to cancel <lb/>these loops. Since the stop lives in both the U  R  and Q  L  superfields, this typically also <lb/>suggests that the left-handed sbottom is also light. <lb/>2. Light Higgsinos. In order to preserve natural electroweak symmetry breaking, µ should <lb/>be on the order of the electroweak scale. This is the same parameter that determines the <lb/>Higgsino mass, so the Higgsinos should also be light. <lb/>3. Not-too-heavy gluinos. The stop is a scalar particle which is, itself, quadratically uv <lb/> sensitive at face value. The main contribution to the stop mass comes from gluon loops so <lb/>that naturalness requires &apos;not-too-heavy&apos; (∼ 1.5 tev) gluinos to cancel these loops. In other <lb/>words, the gluino feeds into the Higgs mass at two-loop order since it keeps the light-stop <lb/>light enough to cancel the Higgs&apos; one-loop uv sensitivity. <lb/></body>

All other superpartners are assumed to <lb/>have masses well above the tev scale and decouple. <lb/>4. Light-ish electroweak-inos (optional). Finally, if one insists on grand unification, the scale <lb/>of the gluinos imposes a mass spectrum on the electroweak gauginos with M  ew-ino  &lt; M  gluino  . <lb/>As a rough estimate, Majorana gluinos should have mass  2m  t  while Dirac gluinos should <lb/>have mass  4m  t  . <lb/>5. All other particles decoupled. All of the other squarks and sleptons are assumed to be <lb/>well above the tev scale and effectively inaccessible at Run-I of the lhc. <lb/> These are shown in Fig. 3. <lb/>The simplest models have a light stop  t  L  which decays either to a top and neutralino/gravitino, <lb/> t + <lb/> N , or a bottom and a chargino, b + <lb/> C. Bounds on these decays depend on the <lb/> N ( <lb/> C) mass. The <lb/>&apos;stealthy&apos; region near m <lb/> N  = 0 and the &apos;compressed&apos; region near m <lb/> N  ≈ m  t  are especially difficult <lb/>to probe kinematically. <lb/> 2.17.4 R-parity violation <lb/> One of the main ways to search for &apos;vanilla&apos; susy signatures is to trigger on the large amount <lb/>of missing energy (met or  <lb/> E  T  ) expected from the neutral lsp. Underlying this assumption is <lb/> R-parity, which forces the lsp to to be stable. <lb/>Recall that R-parity was something that we embraced because it killed the supersymmetric <lb/>terms in the superpotential (2.50) that would violate lepton and baryon number and would be <lb/>severely constrained by experiments, most notably proton decay. If, however, there were another <lb/>way to suppress these dangerous operators, then perhaps we could avoid the experimental bounds <lb/>while giving the lsp a way to decay into non-supersymmetric particles. This would allow us to <lb/>consider models with R-parity violation (rpv) with no missing energy signal [56–60], see [61] for <lb/>a review. Such models would be immune to the usual met-based susy search strategies. <lb/>The simplest way to do this is to turn on only the λ  4  ¯ <lb/> U ¯ <lb/> D ¯ <lb/> D term. This violates baryon number <lb/>but preserves lepton number so that protons remain stable. Motivated by naturalness, we may <lb/>now allow the stop to be the lsp since this is no longer a dark matter candidate. The rpv coupling <lb/>would allow a decay  t → ¯ b¯ s, which would be hidden in the large qcd di-jet background. <lb/>One still has to worry about the effects of this rpv coupling on the partners of the light <lb/>squarks. Phenomenologically, the strictest bounds come from neutron–anti-neutron oscillation and <lb/>dinucleon decay. Indeed, most of the flavor bounds on the mssm come from the first two generations <lb/>of sparticles. One interesting model-building tool is to invoke minimal flavor violation, which <lb/>posits that the flavor structure of the entire mssm is carried by the Yukawa matrices [62]. This then <lb/>implies that the coefficient of the ¯ <lb/> U <lb/> i  ¯ <lb/> D <lb/> j  ¯ <lb/> D <lb/> k  rpv coupling is proportional to a product of Yukawa <lb/></body>

			<body> elements depending on the generations i,j, and k. This gives a natural explanation for why the <lb/> rpv couplings of the first two generation squarks are much smaller than the stop. <lb/> 3 Extra Dimensions <lb/> The original proposal for extra dimensions by Kaluza [63], Klein [64], and later Einstein [65] were <lb/>attempts to unify electromagnetism with gravitation. Several decades later the development of <lb/>string theory—originally as a dual theory to explain the Regge trajectories of hadronic physics— <lb/>led physicists to revisit the idea of compact extra dimensions [66–68]. In early models, the non-<lb/>observation of an additional spatial direction was explained by requiring the compactification <lb/>radius to be too small for macroscopic objects. <lb/> Further reading: Two of the authors&apos; favorite reviews on this subject are [69] and [70]. This lecture is meant <lb/>to be largely complementary. Additional references include [71–76], which focus on different aspects. <lb/> 3.1 Kaluza-Klein decomposition <lb/> The simplest example to begin with is a real scalar field in 5D where the fifth dimension is com-<lb/>pactified to a circle of radius R. The details of the compactification do not change the qualitative <lb/>behavior of the theory at low energies. The Lagrangian is <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 5  x <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∂  M  φ(x, y)∂ <lb/> M  φ(x, y) = <lb/> d <lb/> 5  x <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∂  µ  φ(x, y)∂ <lb/> µ  φ(x, y) − (∂  y  φ(x, y)) <lb/> 2  <lb/> , <lb/> (3.1) <lb/>where M = 0, · · · , 5 and x  5  = y. Since y is compact, we may identify energy eigenstates by doing <lb/>a Fourier decomposition in the extra dimension, <lb/> φ(x, y) = <lb/>1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2πR <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=−∞ <lb/> φ <lb/> (n)  (x) e <lb/> i <lb/> n <lb/> R <lb/> y  . <lb/> (3.2) <lb/>Since φ is real, <lb/> φ <lb/> (n) <lb/>   †  = φ <lb/> (−n)  . Plugging this expansion into the action allows us to use the <lb/>orthogonality of the Fourier terms to perform the dy integral. This leaves us with an expression <lb/>for the action that is an integral over only the non-compact dimensions, but written in terms of <lb/>the kk modes φ <lb/> (n)  (x), <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> mn <lb/> dy <lb/> 1 <lb/>2πR <lb/> e <lb/> i <lb/> (m+n) <lb/> R <lb/> y <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∂  µ  φ <lb/> (m)  (x)∂ <lb/> µ  φ <lb/> (n)  (x) + <lb/> mn <lb/>R  2  φ <lb/> (m)  (x)φ <lb/> (n)  (x) <lb/> (3.3) <lb/>= <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> n <lb/> ∂  µ  φ <lb/> (−n)  ∂ <lb/> µ  φ <lb/> (n)  − <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  2  φ <lb/> (−n)  φ <lb/> (n) <lb/> (3.4) <lb/>= <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> n&gt;0 <lb/> ∂  µ  φ <lb/> (n) <lb/>   †  ∂ <lb/> µ  φ <lb/> (n)  − <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  2 <lb/> φ <lb/> (n) <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (3.5) <lb/>From the 4D point of view, a single 5D scalar becomes a &apos;Kaluza-Klein (kk) tower&apos; of 4D particles, <lb/>each with mass n/R.

We know that gauge fields are associated with <lb/>vector particles, but in 5D the vector now carries five components, A  M  . We perform the same kk <lb/> decomposition for each component M , <lb/> A  M  (x, y) = <lb/>1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2πR <lb/> n <lb/> A <lb/> (n) <lb/> M  (x) e <lb/> i <lb/> n <lb/>R <lb/> y  . <lb/> (3.7) <lb/>Note that this decomposes into a kk tower of 4D vectors, A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  , and a kk tower of 4D scalars, <lb/> A <lb/> (n) <lb/>5  . Similarly, the field strengths are antisymmetric with respect to indices M and N so that the <lb/>action is decomposed according to <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x dy <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F  M N  F <lb/> M N <lb/> (3.8) <lb/>= <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x dy − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F  µν  F <lb/> µν  + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(∂  µ  A  5  − ∂  5  A  µ  ) (∂ <lb/> µ  A  5  − ∂  5  A <lb/> µ  ) <lb/>(3.9) <lb/>= <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> n <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F <lb/> (−n) <lb/> µν  F <lb/> (n)µν  + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∂  µ  A <lb/> (−n) <lb/>5 <lb/> − ∂  5  A <lb/> (−n) <lb/> µ <lb/> ∂ <lb/> µ  A <lb/> (n) <lb/>5  − ∂  5  A <lb/> (n)µ <lb/> . <lb/> (3.10) <lb/>This looks complicated because there is an odd mixing between the 4D vector, A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  , and the 4D <lb/>scalar A <lb/> (n) <lb/>5  . Fortunately, this mixing term can be removed by fixing to 5D axial gauge, <lb/> A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  → A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  − <lb/> i <lb/>n/R <lb/>∂  µ  A <lb/> (n) <lb/>5 <lb/> A <lb/> (n) <lb/>5  → 0, <lb/>(3.11) <lb/>for n  = 0. Note that for n = 0 there&apos;s no scalar–vector mixing anyway. The resulting action takes <lb/>a much nicer form, <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F <lb/> (0) <lb/> µν <lb/>  2  + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∂  µ  A <lb/> (0) <lb/>5 <lb/> + <lb/> n≥1 <lb/> 2 <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F <lb/> (−n) <lb/> µν  F <lb/> (n)µν  + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/> R  2  A <lb/> (−n) <lb/> µ <lb/> A <lb/> (n)µ <lb/> . <lb/> (3.12) <lb/>The spectrum includes a tower of massive vector particles as well as a massless (zero mode) gauge <lb/>boson and scalar. <lb/>Recall the usual expression for the number of degrees of freedom in a massless 4D gauge boson: <lb/>(4 components in A  µ  ) − (longitudinal mode) − (gauge redundancy). <lb/>(3.13) <lb/>When the gauge boson becomes massive, it picks up a longitudinal mode from eating a scalar by <lb/>the Goldstone mechanism. This is precisely what has happened to our kk gauge bosons, A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  : <lb/>they pick up a mass by eating the scalar kk modes, A <lb/> (n) <lb/>5  . <lb/></body>

			<body> In a theory with (4 + n) dimensions, the (4 + n)-component vector A  M  decomposes into a <lb/>massless gauge boson, n massless scalars, a tower of massive kk vectors A  µ  , and a tower of (n − 1) <lb/>massive kk scalars. <lb/>One may similarly generalize to spin-2 particles such as the graviton. In (4 + n) dimensions <lb/>these are represented by an antisymmetric (4 + n) × (4 + n) tensor, <lb/> g  M N  = <lb/>  <lb/>   g  µν  A  µ <lb/> ϕ <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (3.14) <lb/>The massless 4D zero modes include the usual 4D graviton, a vector, and a scalar. At the massive <lb/>level, there is a kk tower of gravitons with (n − 1) gauge fields and [ <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2 <lb/> n(n + 1) − n] scalars. Here <lb/>we observe the graviton and vector eating the required degrees of freedom to become massive. <lb/> 3.3 Matching of couplings <lb/> It is important to notice that the mass dimension of couplings and fields depend on the number <lb/>of spacetime dimensions. The action is dimensionless, [S] = 0, since it is exponentiated in the <lb/>partition function. Then, in (4 + n) dimensions, the kinetic term for a boson gives <lb/> d <lb/> (4+n)  x (∂φ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> = −(4 + n) + 2 + 2[φ] = 0 <lb/> ⇒ <lb/> [φ] = 1 + <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (3.15) <lb/>Note that this is consistent with the dimensions in the kk expansion (3.2). The 5D scalar contains <lb/>the 4D scalars with a prefactor ∼ R <lb/> −1/2  that has mass dimension 1/2. Similarly, for fermions, <lb/>[ψ] = <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/> + <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/> . With this information, dimensions of the Lagrangian couplings can be read off <lb/>straightforwardly. For example, the 5D gauge field lives in the covariant derivative, <lb/> D  µ  = ∂  µ  − ig  5  A  µ  = ∂  µ  − i <lb/>g  5 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2πR <lb/> A <lb/> (0) <lb/> µ  + · · · . <lb/> (3.16) <lb/>We see that [g  5  ] = −1/2 since [∂] = 1 and [A  M  ] = 3/2. Further, we find an explicit relation <lb/>between the 5D parameter g  5  and the observed 4D gauge coupling, <lb/> g  4  = <lb/> g  5 <lb/> √ <lb/> 2πR <lb/> . <lb/> (3.17) <lb/>More generally, in (4 + n) dimensions the 4D coupling is related to the higher dimensional coupling <lb/>by the volume of the extra dimensional space, <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/>4  = <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/>(4+n) <lb/> Vol  n <lb/> . <lb/> (3.18) <lb/>One can read off the matching of the gravitational coupling by looking at the prefactor of the Ricci <lb/>term in the action, <lb/> S  (4+n)  = −M <lb/> 2+n <lb/>(4+n) <lb/> d <lb/> 4+n  x <lb/> √ g R  (4+n)  = −M <lb/> 2+n <lb/>(4+n)  V  n <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> √ g  (4)  R  (4)  + · · · , <lb/> (3.19) <lb/>where we&apos;ve written g for the determinant of the metric. From this we identify 4D Planck mass <lb/> M  Pl  from the fundamental higher dimensional Planck mass, M  (4+n)  , <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/>Pl  = M <lb/> 2+n <lb/>(4+n)  V  n  . <lb/> (3.20) <lb/></body>

			<body> The higher dimensional Planck mass is a good choice for a fundamental mass scale for the <lb/>theory, <lb/> M  *  = M  (4+n)  . <lb/> (3.21) <lb/>In a (4 + n) dimensional theory where the characteristic mass scale is M  *  and a compactification <lb/>radius R. Then dimensional analysis tells us that the higher dimensional gauge couplings, which <lb/>are dimensionful, characteristically scale like <lb/> g  (4+n)  ∼ M <lb/> −n/2 <lb/> * <lb/> . <lb/> (3.22) <lb/>Relating this to the 4D couplings with (3.18) and relating M  *  to the 4D Planck mass with (3.20) <lb/>gives <lb/> R ∼ <lb/> 1 <lb/> M  Pl <lb/> g <lb/> (n+2)/N <lb/>4 <lb/> . <lb/> (3.23) <lb/>Plugging in the observed sm gauge couplings on the right hand side gives a compactification radius <lb/>which is far too small to be relevant at colliders—the first kk modes will be near the Planck scale. <lb/> 3.4 Branes and Large Extra Dimensions <lb/> In the mid &apos;90s, developments in string theory led to a new ingredient that renewed interest in <lb/>extra dimensions that might be accessible at collider scales. The key idea is that branes, solitonic <lb/>objects which form lower dimensional subspaces, can trap fields. In other words, not all fields <lb/>have to propagate in all dimensions. This was introduced by Rubakov and Shaposhnikov [77], <lb/>who showed that instead of a very small radius of compactification, it may be that our observed <lb/>universe is constrained to live in a (3+1)-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional spacetime. <lb/> Terminology. Models that make use of branes to localize fields are known as braneworld models and are <lb/>distinguished from models where all fields propagate in the extra dimensions, known as universal extra <lb/>dimensions. In braneworld models, fields which are allowed to propagate in the full space are said to live in <lb/>the bulk. <lb/> Allowing the fields to be brane-localized buys us quite a lot. It allows us to separate particle <lb/>physics from gravity. One can, for example, force the sm fields to be truly four-dimensional <lb/>objects that are stuck to a (3+1)-dimensional brane. This avoids the bound on the size of the <lb/>extra dimension in (3.23), since that relied on the sm propagating in the bulk. <lb/>With this in mind, one could allow the volume of the extra dimensions to actually be quite <lb/>large. This idea was explored by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali in the add or large <lb/>extra dimension scenario [78]. If this were feasible, then (3.20) gives a new way to address the <lb/>Hierarchy problem. The large volume factor allows the fundamental scale of nature to be much <lb/>smaller than the observed Planck mass, M  *   M  Pl  . If, for example, M  *  ∼ 1 tev, then there is <lb/>no Hierarchy problem. Gravity appears to be weaker at short distances because its flux is diluted <lb/>by the extra dimensions. As one accesses scales smaller than R, however, one notices that gravity <lb/>actually propagates in (4 + n) dimensions. A cartoon of the braneworld scenario is shown in Fig. 4. <lb/>How large can this extra dimension be? Doing a rough matching and using Vol  n  = r <lb/> n  in (3.20) <lb/>gives <lb/> R = <lb/>1 <lb/> M  * <lb/> M  Pl <lb/> M  * <lb/>  2/n <lb/> . <lb/> (3.24) <lb/></body>

Gravity propagates in the entire space &apos;diluting&apos; its field lines relative to <lb/>forces localized on the brane. (right) sm processes localized on the brane, now with an additional <lb/>dimension drawn, emitting a graviton into the bulk. <lb/>Pushing the fundamental scale to M  *  ∼ tev requires <lb/> R = 10 <lb/> 32/n  tev <lb/> −1  = 2 · 10 <lb/> −17  10 <lb/> 32/n  cm, <lb/>(3.25) <lb/>using GeV <lb/> −1  = 2 · 10 <lb/> −14  cm. We make the important caveat that this is specifically for the ADD <lb/> model. Considering different numbers of extra dimensions, <lb/> • n = 1. For a single extra dimension we have R = 10 <lb/> 15  cm, which is roughly the size of the <lb/>solar system and is quickly ruled out. <lb/> • n = 2. Two extra dimensions brings us down to R ≈ 0.1 cm, which is barely ruled out by <lb/>gravitational Cavendish experiments. <lb/> • n = 3. Three extra dimensions pushes us down to R &lt; 10 <lb/> −6  cm. <lb/>How much do we know about gravity at short distances? Surprisingly little, actually. Cavendish <lb/>experiments (e.g. Eöt-Wash <lb/> 5  ) test the r <lb/> −2  law down to 10 <lb/> −4  m. These set a direct bound on the <lb/> n = 2 case that R &lt; 37 µm and M  *  &gt; 1.4 TeV. For larger n one is allowed to have M  *  = TeV. <lb/>One might have objected that one cannot say that M  *  is the fundamental scale while allowing <lb/> R, itself a dimensionful quantity, float to take on any value. Indeed, in a completely natural theory, <lb/>one expects R ∼ 1/M  *  so that R ∼ tev <lb/> −1  . This is quite different from what we wrote in (3.24). <lb/>Indeed, what we have done here is swapped the hierarchy in mass scales to a Hierarchy between <lb/> R and M <lb/> −1 <lb/> *  . In other words, we have reformulated the Hierarchy problem to a problem of radius <lb/> stabilization. This is indeed very difficult to solve in add. <lb/> Nevertheless, we may explore the phenomenological consequences of an add type model at <lb/>colliders and through astrophysical observations. <lb/> • The first thing to consider is the production of kk gravitons. <lb/></body>

			<body> f <lb/> f <lb/>G <lb/>γ, g <lb/> The kk graviton couples too weakly to interact with the detector so it appears as missing <lb/>energy. By itself, however, missing energy is difficult to disentangle from, say, neutrino <lb/>production. Thus it&apos;s useful to have a handle for the hardness of the event (more energetic <lb/>than Z → ν ¯ <lb/> ν) so one can look for processes that emit a hard photon or gluon. Thus a <lb/>reasonable search is a jet or photon with missing energy. It is worth noting that this is the <lb/>same search used for searching for dark matter, which is also typically a massive particle <lb/>which appears as missing energy. <lb/> • Alternately, one may search for s-channel virtual graviton exchange in processes like e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → <lb/> f ¯ <lb/> f . One expects a resonance at the kk graviton mass. <lb/> • Supernovae can cool due to the emission of gravitons. This is similar to the supernovae <lb/>cooling bounds on axions. The strongest bounds on n = 2 theories push M  *   100 TeV. <lb/> • An additional byproduct of lowering the fundamental gravitational scale is that one may form <lb/>microscopic black holes at energies kinematically accessible to the lhc and cosmic rays. For <lb/> E  CM  &gt; M  *  black holes are formed with a radius <lb/> R  S  ∼ <lb/> 1 <lb/> M  * <lb/> M  BH <lb/> M  * <lb/>  1 <lb/> n+1 <lb/> . <lb/> (3.26) <lb/>the cross section is roughly the geometric value, σ  BH  ∼ πR <lb/> 2 <lb/> S  and can be as large as 400 pb. <lb/>These microscopic black holes decay via Hawking radiation, <lb/> T  H  ∼ <lb/> 1 <lb/> R  S <lb/> (3.27) <lb/>with this energy distributed equally to all degrees of freedom, for example 10% going to <lb/>leptons, 2% going to photons, and 75% going to many jets. <lb/> 3.5 Warped extra dimensions <lb/> We&apos;ve seen that the framework of large extra dimensions leads to interesting phenomenology, but <lb/>the add realization leaves the size of the radius unexplained and is therefore not a complete solution <lb/>to the Hierarchy problem. The Randall-Sundrum (rs) proposal for a warped extra dimension offers <lb/>a more interesting possibility [79]. The set up differs from add in that the space between the two <lb/>branes has a non-factorizable metric that depends on the extra space coordinate, z, <lb/>ds <lb/> 2  = <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  2 <lb/> η  µν  dx <lb/> µ  dx <lb/> ν  − dz <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (3.28) <lb/>This is the metric of anti-de Sitter space (ads) with curvature k = 1/R. There are two branes <lb/>located at z = R (the uv brane) and z = R <lb/>  &gt; R (the ir brane) that truncate the extra dimension; <lb/></body>

			<page>38 <lb/></page>

			<body> in this sense the rs background is often described as a &apos;slice of ads.&apos; We see that 1/R is naturally <lb/>a fundamental uv scale of the theory. The metric (3.28) warps down the natural physical scale as <lb/>a function of the position along the extra dimension. In particular, when R <lb/>   R one finds that <lb/>near z = R <lb/>  , the scales are warped down to much smaller values. Note the different notation from <lb/>the add case: the size of the extra dimension is R <lb/>  − R ≈ R <lb/>  , while R should be identified with <lb/>the radius of curvature. <lb/>To see how this works, suppose that the Higgs is localized to live on the ir brane at z = R <lb/>  . <lb/>The action on this brane depends on the 4D induced metric <lb/>  µν  (note that <lb/> √ <lb/> ˆ <lb/> g = <lb/> √ <lb/> g/ <lb/> √ <lb/> g  55  ), <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> ˆ <lb/> g <lb/> ∂  µ  H∂  ν  H ˆ <lb/> g <lb/> µν  − <lb/> |H| <lb/> 2  − <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> (3.29) <lb/>We assume that the Higgs vev is on the order of the uv scale, v = 1/R, since this is the funda-<lb/>mental 5D scale. Plugging in the metic gives <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> R <lb/>R  <lb/>  4 <lb/> ∂  µ  H∂ <lb/> µ  H <lb/> R <lb/> R <lb/>  2 <lb/> − <lb/> |H| <lb/> 2  − <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> z=R  <lb/> , <lb/> (3.30) <lb/>where indices are implicitly raised with respect to the Minkowski metric. Canonically normalizing <lb/>the kinetic term via <lb/>ˆ <lb/> H = <lb/> R <lb/>R   H, <lb/> (3.31) <lb/>allows us to write the action in the form, <lb/> S = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> ∂  µ  ˆ <lb/> H <lb/>  2 <lb/> − λ <lb/> | ˆ <lb/> H| <lb/> 2  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> v <lb/>R <lb/>R  <lb/>  2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> , <lb/> (3.32) <lb/>where we see that the canonically normalized Higgs picks up a vev that is warped down to the <lb/> tev scale. One can further imagine that the cutoff for loops contributing to the Higgs mass are <lb/>similarly warped down to, say, the tev scale. In this way, the warped extra dimension gives a <lb/>new handle for generating hierarchies. Readers should be skeptical that we&apos;re not just hiding the <lb/>Hierarchy problem in some fine tuning of the ir scale R <lb/>  relative to the fundamental scale R. <lb/> Indeed, the real solution to the Hierarchy problem requires a mechanism for radius stabilization, <lb/>which we present below. Note that typically R ≈ M <lb/> −1 <lb/> Pl  and R <lb/>  ≈ TeV <lb/> −1  so that R <lb/>  is roughly the <lb/>size of the extra dimension. A cartoon of this scenario is shown in Fig. 5. <lb/>In the remainder of this lecture we&apos;ll focus on the rs background. In the appendices we present <lb/>some additional technical results that may be useful for building rs models. Further details of <lb/>the rs gravitational background are discussed in Appendices A.1 and A.2. Details of bulk matter <lb/>fields are discussed in Appendices A.3 and A.4 <lb/> 3.6 The Planck scale and hierarchy in RS <lb/> We have seen how the ads curvature can warp mass scales to be much smaller than the fundamental <lb/>5D scale 1/R. It is instructive to also check the observed Planck scale.

This is precisely what we have set out to construct: assuming <lb/>there is a dynamical reason for R <lb/>   R, we are able to warp down masses to the tev scale by <lb/>forcing particles to localize on the ir brane while simultaneously maintaining that 4D observers <lb/>will measure a Planck mass that is much heavier. <lb/>An alternate way of saying this is that the Hierarchy problem is solved because the sm Higgs <lb/>is peaked towards the ir brane while gravity is peaked towards the uv brane. What we mean by <lb/>the latter part of this statement is that the graviton zero mode has a bulk profile that is peaked <lb/>towards the uv brane. Recall that in flat space, zero modes have flat profiles since they carry no <lb/>momentum in the extra dimension. In rs, the warping of the space also warps the shape of the <lb/>graviton zero mode towards the uv brane; the weakness of gravity is explained by the smallness of <lb/>the graviton zero mode profile where the Standard Model particles live. This should be compared <lb/>to the case of a flat interval where the zero mode wave function decouples as the size of the extra <lb/>dimension increases. In this case the coupling with the ir brane indeed becomes weaker, but the <lb/>graviton kk modes become accessible and can spoil the appearance of 4D gravity. In rs the zero <lb/>mode doesn&apos;t decouple and one doesn&apos;t need to appeal to a dilution of the gravitational flux into <lb/>the extra dimensions as in the add model. See [69] for more explicit calculations in this picture. <lb/></body>

			<body> 3.7 Bulk scalar profiles in RS <lb/> In the original rs model, only gravity propagates in the bulk and has kk modes. However, it is <lb/>instructive to derive the kk properties of a bulk scalar. <lb/> • This serves as a simple template for how to kk reduce more complicated fields, such as the <lb/>graviton, in a warped background. <lb/> • We&apos;re anticipating the &apos;modern&apos; incarnations of the rs where gauge and matter fields are <lb/>pulled into the bulk. <lb/> • As mentioned above, the solution to the Hierarchy problem depends on stabilizing the posi-<lb/>tion of the ir brane, z = R <lb/>  , relative to the uv brane, z = R. The standard technique for <lb/>doing this requires a bulk scalar. <lb/>Start with a bulk complex scalar Φ(x, z) with a bulk mass parameter m. The bulk action is <lb/> S = <lb/>  R  <lb/> R <lb/> dz <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x <lb/> √ <lb/> g <lb/> (∂  M  Φ) <lb/>  *  ∂ <lb/> M  Φ − m <lb/> 2  Φ <lb/>  *  Φ <lb/> . <lb/> (3.36) <lb/>In principle one may have additional brane-localized interactions proportional to δ(z − R <lb/>  ) or <lb/> δ(z − R). We use M, N to index 5D coordinates while µ, ν only run over 4D coordinates. Varying <lb/>with respect to Φ <lb/>  *  yields an equation of motion <lb/> ∂  M <lb/>  √ gg <lb/> M N  ∂  N  Φ <lb/> − <lb/>√ gm <lb/> 2  Φ = 0. <lb/>(3.37) <lb/>In writing this we have dropped an overall surface term that we picked up when integrating by <lb/>parts. Specializing to the rs metric, this amounts to picking boundary conditions such that <lb/>Φ <lb/>  *  (z)∂  z  Φ(z)|  R,R   = 0, <lb/>(3.38) <lb/>with the appropriate modifications if there are brane-localized terms. We see that we have a choice <lb/>of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We now plug in the Kaluza-Klein decomposition <lb/>in terms of yet-unknown basis functions f <lb/> (n)  (z) which encode the profile of the n <lb/> th  mode in the <lb/>extra dimension: <lb/>Φ(x, z) <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n <lb/> φ <lb/> (n)  (x)f <lb/> (n)  (z). <lb/>(3.39) <lb/>By assumption the φ <lb/> (n)  are eigenstates of η <lb/> µν  ∂  µ  ∂  ν  with eigenvalue −m <lb/> 2 <lb/>(n)  , the kk mass. We are <lb/>thus left with a differential equation for f <lb/> (n)  (z), <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  3 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/>(n)  − <lb/> 3 <lb/> z <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  3 <lb/> ∂  z  + <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  3 <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2 <lb/> z  − <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  5 <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> f <lb/> (n)  (z) = 0. <lb/>(3.40) <lb/>This is a Strum-Liouville equation with real eigenvalues and real, orthonormal eigenfunctions, <lb/>  R  <lb/> R <lb/> dz <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  3 <lb/> f <lb/> (n)  (z)f <lb/> (m)  (z) = δ <lb/> mn  . <lb/> (3.41) <lb/></body>

			<page>41 <lb/></page>

			<body> Just as we saw in Section 3.1 for a flat extra dimension, this orthonormality relation diagonalizes <lb/>the kk kinetic terms. One may now solve (3.40) by observing that through suitable redefinitions <lb/>this is simply a Bessel equation. The result is a general solution for n &gt; 0 of the form <lb/> f <lb/> (n)  (z) = c  1  z <lb/> 2  J  α  (m  (n)  z) + c  1  z <lb/> 2  Y  α  (m  (n)  z), <lb/> (3.42) <lb/>where J, Y are the familiar Bessel functions and α = <lb/> √ <lb/> 4 + m  2  R  2  . The integration constants c  1,2 <lb/> and the spectrum of kk masses m <lb/> 2 <lb/>(n)  can be found using boundary conditions on each brane and the <lb/>orthonormality relation (3.41). The states have a discrete spectrum with spacing of approximately <lb/> R <lb/> −1  ∼ tev with profiles peaked towards the ir brane. <lb/>For n = 0 the zero mode profile is <lb/> f <lb/> (0)  (z) = c  1  z <lb/> 2− <lb/> √ <lb/> 4+m  2  R  2  + c  2  z <lb/> 2+ <lb/> √ <lb/> 4+m  2  R  2  . <lb/> (3.43) <lb/>We use this result in the Goldberger-Wise mechanism discussed below, but let us remark that <lb/>the zero mode is neither consistent with Neumann nor Dirichlet boundary conditions and requires <lb/>brane localized terms to generate boundary conditions that permit a zero mode. <lb/>The same general procedure can be used to find the profiles of higher spin bulk fields. In <lb/>Appendices A.3 and A.4 we work through the additional subtleties coming from fermions and <lb/>gauge bosons. A Standard Model field is associated with the zero mode of a 5D field, where <lb/>the sm mass is a correction from electroweak symmetry breaking on the zero mass from the kk <lb/> decomposition. Note that the meaning of the 5D profile is that a 4D particle, even though it is <lb/>localized and pointlike in the four Minkowski dimensions, is an extended plane wave in the fifth <lb/>dimension. The boundary conditions imposed by the branes mean that this system is essentially <lb/>identical to a waveguide in electrodynamics <lb/> 6  . <lb/> 3.8 Radius stabilization <lb/> We&apos;ve now shifted the Hierarchy problem to a question of why the ir scale R <lb/>  is so much larger <lb/>than the uv scale R. In fact, one should think about R <lb/>  as the expectation value of a dynamical <lb/>degree of freedom, R <lb/>  = r(x, z), called the radion. This is identified with the 4D scalar arising <lb/>from the dimensional decomposition of the 5D metric. This isn&apos;t surprising since the metric is, of <lb/>course, the quantity which measures distances. Thus far in our description of the rs framework, <lb/>the radion is a modulus—it has no potential and could take any value. This is problematic since <lb/>excitations of this field would be massless and lead to long-range modifications to gravity. It is <lb/>thus important to find a mechanism that dynamically fixes R <lb/>  ∼ tev <lb/> −1  to (1) provide a complete <lb/>solution to the Hierarchy problem and (2) avoid constraints from modifications to gravity. <lb/> Don&apos;t be fooled by coordinate choices. The original rs literature used variables such that the metric <lb/>explicitly contained an exponential warping ds <lb/> 2  = e <lb/> −2ky  dx <lb/> 2  − dy <lb/> 2  so that an O(10) value of kπR <lb/>  leads to large <lb/>hierarchies. Do not confuse this variable choice with a solution to the Hierarchy problem—it just shifts the <lb/>fine tuning into a parameter to which the theory is exponentially sensitive. The reason why the exponential <lb/>hierarchy is actually physical in rs (with a dynamically stabilized radius) is that fields propagating in the space <lb/>are redshifted as they &apos;fall&apos; towards the ir brane in the gravitational well of the ads background. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 6  This should have been no surprise given the appearance of Bessel functions. <lb/></note>

			<page> 42 <lb/></page>

			<body> A standard solution in the rs model is the Goldberger-Wise mechanism <lb/> 7  [81,82], where radion <lb/>kinetic and potential energy terms conspire against one another to select vacuum with finite R <lb/>  . To <lb/>do this, we introduce a massive bulk scalar field Φ(x, z) of the type in Section 3.7. We introduce <lb/>brane-localized potentials for this field which force it to obtain a different vev at each brane, <lb/> ϕ  uv  = ϕ  ir  , <lb/>∆L = −λδ(z − R) <lb/> Φ <lb/> 2  − ϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> uv <lb/>  2  − λδ(z − R <lb/>  ) <lb/> Φ <lb/> 2  − ϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ir <lb/>  2 <lb/> λ → ∞. <lb/> (3.44) <lb/>This causes the scalar to pick up a z-dependent vev that interpolates between ϕ  uv  and ϕ  ir  , <lb/> Φ(x, z) = ϕ(z) <lb/>ϕ(R) = ϕ  uv <lb/> ϕ(R <lb/>  ) = ϕ  ir  . <lb/> (3.45) <lb/>The general form of ϕ(z) is precisely the zero mode profile in (3.43) since the vev carries zero <lb/>momentum in the Minkowski directions. One may now consider the terms in the action of Φ(x, z) <lb/> (evaluated on the vev ϕ(z)) as contributions to the potential for the radion via R <lb/>  = r(x, z). <lb/> The kinetic term for Φ(x, z) contributes a potential to r(x, z) that goes like ϕ <lb/>  (z) <lb/> 2  . <lb/>1. This gradient energy is minimized when ϕ(z) has a large distance to interpolate between <lb/> ϕ  uv,ir  since larger R <lb/>  allows a smaller slope. <lb/>2. On the other hand, the bulk mass for Φ(x, z) gives an energy per unit length in the z-direction <lb/> when ϕ(z)  = 0. Thus the energy from this term is minimized when R <lb/>  is small. <lb/>By balancing these two effects, one is able to dynamically fix a value for R <lb/>  . A pedagogical <lb/>derivation of this presented in [71]. The main idea is that for small values of the bulk Φ(x, z) mass, <lb/> m <lb/> 2  R <lb/> −2  , one may write the Φ(x, z) vev as <lb/> ϕ = c  1  z <lb/> −ε  + c  2  z <lb/> 4+ε  , <lb/> (3.46) <lb/>where ε = α − 2 = <lb/> √ <lb/> 4 + m  2  R  2  − 2 ≈ m <lb/> 2  R <lb/> 2  /4 is small. The coefficients c  1,2  are determined by the <lb/>boundary conditions (3.45). The potential takes the form <lb/> V [R <lb/>  ] = ε <lb/>ϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> uv <lb/> R <lb/> + <lb/> R <lb/> 3 <lb/> R  4 <lb/> (4 + 2ε) <lb/> ϕ  ir  − ϕ  uv <lb/> R <lb/>R  <lb/>  ε   2 <lb/> − εϕ  ir  R <lb/> −4 <lb/> + O <lb/> R <lb/> 4 <lb/> R  8 <lb/> , <lb/> (3.47) <lb/>where judicious checkers of dimensions will recall that the dimension of the 5D scalar is [ϕ(x, z)] = <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/> . The minimum of this potential is <lb/> R <lb/>  = R <lb/> ϕ  uv <lb/> ϕ  ir <lb/>  1/ε <lb/> . <lb/> (3.48) <lb/>We can generate the Planck-weak hierarchy with 1// ∼ 20 and ϕ  uv  /ϕ  ir  ∼ 10. A key point here is <lb/>that we may write the radius in terms of a characteristic energy scale, R <lb/>  ∼ 1/µ, and the potential <lb/>for µ carries terms that go like µ <lb/> 4  times a polynomial in µ <lb/>  . This is reminiscent of dimensional <lb/>transmutation and, indeed, we explain below that the rs scenario can be understood as a dual <lb/>description of strongly coupled 4D dynamics. <lb/></body>

			<body> The above description of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism neglects the effect of the background <lb/>Φ field on the rs geometry. For example, one may wonder if the rs metric is even compatible <lb/>with the Φ vev. In order to account for this gravitational backreaction, one must solve the Φ <lb/>equation of motion combined with the Einstein equation as a function of the metric (discussed in <lb/>Appendix A.1) in the presence of the Φ vev. This set of coupled second order differential equations <lb/>is generically very difficult to solve. Fortunately, there exists a &apos;superpotential <lb/> 8  &apos; trick that one may <lb/>apply to solve the system exactly. This method is described and demonstrated pedagogically for <lb/>the Goldberger-Wise field in [69, 72]. One finds that it is indeed possible to maintain the rs <lb/> background in the presence of the bulk field necessary to stabilize the radius. <lb/> 3.9 Holographic interpretation <lb/> Gauge/gravity duality is a way to understand the physics of a warped extra dimension as the dual to a <lb/>strongly coupled 4D theory. Our goal here is to develop the intuition to use and understand the ads/cft <lb/> dictionary as an interpretational tool. The most rigorous explicit derivations of this duality are often presented <lb/>in the language of string theory. This idea is presented pedagogically in the language of 4D quantum field theory <lb/>(rather than string theory) in [74,75,84–88]. Those interested in presentations that connect to supergravity and <lb/>string theory may explore [89–94], listed roughly in order of increasing formal theory sophistication starting <lb/>from very little assumed background. We also point out [95] which is an excellent presentation of dualities <lb/>between 4D supersymmetric gauge theories that are analogous to the gauge/gravity correspondence. <lb/> We now introduce a way to re-interpret the observables of rs scenario in terms of the dynamics of <lb/>a purely four-dimensional theory in its non-perturbative regime. The idea is that the symmetries <lb/>of the bulk ads space enforce the symmetries of a conformal theory in 4D—this latter theory <lb/>approximates a strongly coupled theory near a fixed point. Combined with the observation that a <lb/>shift in z causes an overall rescaling of the ads metric (3.28), we can identify slices of constant z as <lb/>scale transformations of the 4D [approximately] conformal theory. In this way, the 5D ads theory <lb/>&apos;geometrizes&apos; the renormalization group flow of the 4D theory. One then interprets the physics on <lb/>the uv brane as a 4D conformal theory that sets the boundary conditions for the 5D fields. Slices <lb/>of constant z describe the rg evolution of this theory at lower energies, µ ∼ 1/z. Because the <lb/>higher-dimensional theory encodes information about the behavior of a lower-dimensional theory <lb/>on its boundary, this identification is known as the holographic interpretation of warped extra <lb/>dimensions. This interpretation is sketched in Fig. 6. <lb/> 3.9.1 Plausibility check from an experimentalist&apos;s perspective <lb/> As a very rough check of why this would be plausible, consider the types of spectra one expects <lb/>from an extra dimensional theory versus a strongly coupled 4D theory. In other words, consider <lb/>the first thing that an experimentalists might want to check about either theory. The theory with <lb/>an extra dimension predicts a tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations for each particle. The strongly <lb/>coupled gauge theory predicts a similar tower of bound states such as the various meson resonances <lb/>in qcd. From the experimentalist&apos;s point of view, these two theories are qualitatively very similar. <lb/></body>

The isometries of the extra dimensional space <lb/>enforce the conformal symmetry of the 4D theory. Moving in the z direction corresponds to a <lb/>renormalization group transformation (rescaling) of the 4D theory. <lb/> 3.9.2 Sketch of a more formal description <lb/> We can better motivate the holographic interpretation by appealing to more formal arguments. <lb/>One of the most powerful developments in theoretical physics over the past two decades is the <lb/> ads/cft correspondence—more generally, the holographic principle or the gauge/gravity <lb/>correspondence [84, 96–98]. The conjecture states that type iib string theory on ads  5  × S <lb/> 5  is <lb/>equivalent to 4D N = 4 superconformal SU(N ) theory on Minkowski space in the large N limit: <lb/> ads  5  × S <lb/> 5 <lb/> ⇐⇒ <lb/>N = 4 super Yang-Mills. <lb/>(3.49) <lb/>The essence of this duality is the observation that a stack of N so-called D3-branes in string theory <lb/>can be interpreted at low energies in two ways: <lb/>1. A solitonic configuration of closed strings which manifests itself as an extended black hole-like <lb/>object for which ads  5  × S <lb/> 5  is a solution. <lb/>2. Dirichlet boundary conditions for open strings which admit a non-Abelian U (N ) gauge sym-<lb/>metry associated with the N coincident D3-branes. <lb/> These correspond to the left-and right-hand side of (3.49) and form the basis of the ads/cft <lb/> correspondence. <lb/>The key for us is that the ads  5  × S <lb/> 5  extra dimension &apos;geometrizes&apos; the renormalization group <lb/>flow of the strongly coupled theory by relating the position in the extra dimension z with the rg <lb/> scale µ. An operator O  i  in the 4D theory has a source j  i  (x, µ) that satisfies an rg equation <lb/> µ <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂µ <lb/>j  i  (x, µ) = β  i  (j  j  (x, µ), µ). <lb/> (3.50) <lb/></body>

			<page>45 <lb/></page>

			<body> The gauge/gravity correspondence identifies this source as the value of a bulk field j  i  (x, µ) ⇔ <lb/> Φ  i  (x, z) at the uv boundary of the ads  5  extra dimension. The profile of Φ  i  in the extra dimension <lb/>is associated with the rg flow of j  i  (x, µ). Each Minkowski slice of ads  5  represents a picture of the <lb/>4D theory probed at a different energy scale µ ∼ 1/z. <lb/>More concretely, the duality gives a prescription by which the correlation functions of one <lb/>theory are identified with correlation functions of the other. The parameters of these two theories <lb/>are related by <lb/> R <lb/> 4 <lb/>  4  = 4πg <lb/> 2  N, <lb/> (3.51) <lb/>where R is the ads curvature,  is the string length, and g is the Yang Mills coupling. Here we <lb/>see why ads/cft is such a powerful tool. In the limit of small string coupling α <lb/>  ∼ <lb/> 2  where <lb/>string theory can be described by classical supergravity, the dual gauge theory is strongly coupled <lb/>and very &apos;quantum&apos;. The correlation functions of that theory are non-perturbative and difficult to <lb/>calculate, whereas the dual description is weakly coupled. The duality gives a handle to calculate <lb/>observables in theories outside the regime where our usual tools are applicable. <lb/> 3.9.3 What it means to geometrize the RG flow <lb/> For our purposes, it is only important that we understand the warped extra dimension as the <lb/>renormalization group flow of a strongly coupled 4D gauge theory. To see how this rg flow is <lb/>&apos;geometrized,&apos; we consider the internal symmetries of the two theories. <lb/> • The isometry of the S <lb/> 5  space is SO(6) ∼ = SU(4). This is precisely the R-symmetry group of <lb/>the N = 4 gauge theory. <lb/> • The isometry of the AdS  5  space is SO(4, 2), which exactly matches the spacetime symmetries <lb/>of a 4D conformal theory. <lb/>Since rs only has a slice of the ads space without the S <lb/> 5  , we expect it to be dual to a confor-<lb/>mal theory without supersymmetry. Steps towards formalizing the holographic interpretation of <lb/>Randall-Sundrum are reviewed in [95]. <lb/>Armed with this background, we can develop a working understanding of how to interpret <lb/> rs models as a picture of a strong, four-dimensional dynamics. Observe that in the conformal <lb/>coordinates that we&apos;ve chosen, the metric has a manifest scale symmetry <lb/> z → αz <lb/>x → αx. <lb/> (3.52) <lb/>Consider 4D cross sections perpendicular to the z direction. Moving this cross section to another <lb/>position z → αz is equivalent to a rescaling of the 4D length scales. Increasing z thus corresponds <lb/>to a decrease in 4D energy scales. In this way, the ads space gives us a holographic handle on the <lb/>renormalization group behavior of the strongly coupled theory. <lb/> 3.9.4 What it means to take a slice of Anti-de Sitter <lb/> The rs scenario differs from ads  5  due to the presence of the uv and ir branes which truncate <lb/>the extra dimension. Since flows along the extra dimension correspond to scale transformations, <lb/>the branes represent scales at which conformal symmetry is broken. The uv brane corresponds <lb/>to an explicit uv cutoff for the 4D conformal theory. The ir brane sets the scale of the kk <lb/></body>

			<page> 46 <lb/></page>

			<body> modes. We heuristically identified these with bound states of the strongly coupled theory, and so <lb/>we can identify the ir brane as a scale where conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the <lb/>theory confines, and one finds a spectrum of bound states. Recall that the bound state profiles <lb/>are localized toward the ir brane; this is an indication that these bound states only exist as one <lb/>approaches the confinement scale. The picture of the rs &apos;slice of ads&apos; is thus of a theory which is <lb/>nearly conformal in the uv that runs slowly under rg flow down to the ir scale where it produces <lb/>bound state resonances. <lb/>The sm, and in particular the Higgs, exist on the ir brane and are thus identified with composite <lb/>states of the strongly coupled theory. In the extra dimensional picture, we argued that the Higgs <lb/>mass is natural because the uv cutoff was warped down to the tev scale. In the dual theory, the <lb/>solution to the Hierarchy problem is compositeness (much like in technicolor): the scalar mass is <lb/>natural because above the confinement scale the scalar disappears and one accesses its strongly <lb/>coupled constituents. By comparison, a state stuck on the uv brane is identified with an elementary <lb/>(non-composite) field that couples to the cft. <lb/> 3.9.5 The meaning of 5D calculations <lb/> At the level presented, it may seem like the ads/cft correspondence is a magic wand for describing <lb/>strong coupling perturbatively—and indeed, if you have started to believe this, it behooves you <lb/>to always know the limits of your favorite tools. A 5D calculation includes entire towers of 4D <lb/>strongly coupled bound states—in what sense are are we doing a perturbation expansion? First <lb/>of all, we underscore that the ads/cft correspondence assumes the &apos;t Hooft large N limit, where <lb/> N is the rank of the gauge group [99]. Further, whether in four or five dimensions, a scattering <lb/>calculation assumes a gap in the particle spectrum. This gap in the 5D mass is translated into a <lb/>gap in the scaling dimension ∆ of the 4D cft operators. Thus one of the implicit assumptions of <lb/>a holographic calculation is that the spectrum of the cft has a gap in scaling dimensions. More <lb/>practically, a scattering process in 5D include 4D fields with large kk masses. We can say definite <lb/>things about these large kk mass states, but only as long as these questions include a sum over <lb/>the entire tower. <lb/> 3.10 The RS Radion is a Dilaton <lb/> We have already met the radion as the dynamical field whose vev sets the distance between <lb/>the uv and ir brane. Excitations of the radion about this vev correspond to fluctuations in the <lb/>position of the ir brane. From its origin as a part of the 5D dynamical metric, it couples to the <lb/>trace of the energy-momentum tensor, <lb/> r <lb/> Λ  ir <lb/> T <lb/> µ <lb/> µ  . <lb/> (3.53) <lb/>Observe that this is very similar to the coupling of the sm Higgs except that it is scaled by a factor <lb/>of <lb/> v <lb/> Λir <lb/> and there are additional couplings due to the trace anomaly—for example, a coupling to <lb/>gluons of the form [82, 100] <lb/> r <lb/> Λ  ir <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> r <lb/> Λ  ir <lb/> F  1/2  (m  t  ) <lb/> α  s <lb/> 8π <lb/>(G <lb/> a <lb/>µν  ) <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (3.54) <lb/>where F  1/2  (m  t  ) = −8m <lb/> 2 <lb/> t  /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> h  + · · · is a triangle diagram function, see e.g. (2.17) of [101]. <lb/></body>

			<page>47 <lb/></page>

			<body> Why should the radion coupling be so similar to the Higgs? Before one stabilizes the radion <lb/> vev (e.g. as in Section 3.8), the radion is a modulus and has a flat potential. In the holographic 4D <lb/>dual, the radion corresponds to the Goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of conformal <lb/>symmetry by the confining dynamics at the ir scale. In other words, in the 4D theory, the radion <lb/>is a dilaton. This is the reason why it is so similar to the sm Higgs: the Higgs is also a dilaton <lb/>in a simple limit of the Standard Model. <lb/>In the sm the only dimensionful parameter is that of the Higgs mass, <lb/> V (H) = λ <lb/> H <lb/>  †  H − <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> . <lb/> (3.55) <lb/>In the limit when λ → 0, the Standard Model thus enjoys an approximate scale invariance. If we <lb/>maintain v  = 0 while taking λ → 0, that is, we leave the Higgs vev on, then: <lb/> • Electroweak breaking SU(2)×U(1) →U(1) gives the usual three Goldstone bosons eaten by <lb/>the W <lb/> ±  and Z <lb/> • The breaking of scale invariance gives an additional Goldstone boson, which is precisely the <lb/>Higgs. <lb/>Indeed, the Higgs couples to the sources of scale invariance breaking: the masses of the fundamental <lb/> sm particles, <lb/> h <lb/>v <lb/> m  f  ¯ <lb/>ΨΨ + M <lb/> 2 <lb/> W  W  µ  W <lb/> µ  + · · · <lb/> . <lb/> (3.56) <lb/>This observation leads to an interesting possibility: could one construct a complete model <lb/>with no elementary scalar Higgs, but where a condensate breaks electroweak symmetry and scale <lb/>invariance? Then the dilaton of this theory may have the properties of the sm Higgs. If one can <lb/>reproduce the observed Higgs mass then it could be very difficult to tell the scenario apart from <lb/>the sm [102]. <lb/> 3.11 Realistic Randall-Sundrum Models <lb/> While the original rs model is sometimes used as a template by lhc experiments to put bounds <lb/>on kk gravitons, most theorists usually refer to rs to mean a more modern variant than the model <lb/>presented thus far. In the so-called &apos;realistic&apos; version of Randall-Sundrum, all of the Standard <lb/>Model fields are allowed to propagate in the bulk [103–105]. Doing this allows one to use other <lb/>features of the rs framework to address other model building issues. For example, pulling the <lb/>gauge fields into the bulk can help for grand unification, but this typically leads to unacceptably <lb/>large corrections to the Peskin-Takeuchi S-parameter. One way to control this is to also allow the <lb/>fermions to live in the bulk. We explain below that the bulk fermions open up a powerful new way <lb/>to use the rs background to generate the hierarchies in the Yukawa matrix. <lb/>Solving the Hierarchy problem requires the Higgs to either be stuck on the ir brane or otherwise <lb/>have a bulk profile that is highly peaked towards it. Allowing the fermions and gauge fields to <lb/>propagate in the bulk introduces a tower of kk modes for each state. These tend to be peaked <lb/>towards the ir brane and, as we learned above, are identified with bound states of the strongly <lb/>coupled holographic dual. The Standard Model matter and gauge content are identified with the <lb/>zero modes of the bulk fields. These carry zero kk mass and pick up small non-zero masses from <lb/>their interaction with the Higgs. When boundary conditions permit them, zero mode profiles can <lb/>have different types of behavior: <lb/></body>

That is to say that it is an admixture of elementary and composite states. <lb/>This is analogous to the mixing between the ρ meson and the photon in qcd. States whose profiles <lb/>are peaked towards the uv brane are mostly elementary, states peaked toward the ir brane are <lb/>mostly composite, and states with flat profiles are an equal admixture. <lb/>The effective 4D coupling between states depends on the overlap integral of their extra di-<lb/>mensional profiles. This gives a way to understand the hierarchies in the Yukawa matrices, since <lb/>these are couplings to the Higgs, which is mostly localized on the ir brane [104–110]. This is a <lb/>realization of the split fermion scenario <lb/> 11  [111–114]. The zero-mode fermions that couple to the <lb/>Higgs, on the other hand, can be peaked on either brane. We can see that even with O(1) 5D <lb/>couplings, if the zero-mode fermions are peaked away from the Higgs, the dz overlap integral of <lb/>their profiles will produce an exponentially small prefactor. We can thus identify heavier quarks as <lb/>those whose bulk mass parameters cause them to lean towards the Higgs, while the lighter quarks <lb/>are those whose bulk mass parameters cause them to lean away from the Higgs. Because the 5D <lb/>couplings can be arbitrary O(1) numbers, this is often called flavor anarchy. This scenario is <lb/>sketched in Fig. 7. <lb/>This framework tells us how to search for &apos;realistic&apos; rs models. Unlike the original rs model, <lb/>whose main experimental signature were kk gravitons decaying to sm states like leptons, the <lb/>profiles of our sm fields tell us what we expect realistic rs to produce. The most abundantly <lb/>produced new states are those with strong coupling, say the kk gluon. Like all of the rs kk <lb/> states, this is peaked towards the ir brane.

			<body> the right-handed tops. This is because we want the tops to have a large Yukawa coupling, and <lb/>the left-handed top cannot be too peaked on the ir brane or else the bottom quark—part of the <lb/>same electroweak doublet—would become heavy. These kk gluons are expected to have a mass <lb/> 3 tev, so we expect these tops to be very boosted. This suggests experimental techniques like jet <lb/>substructure (see [115–117] for reviews). <lb/>There are additional features that one may add to the rs scenario to make it even more realistic. <lb/>From the picture above, the electroweak gauge kk modes lean towards the ir brane where the <lb/>Higgs can cause large mixing with the sm W and Z. This causes large corrections to the Peskin-<lb/>Takeuchi T parameter which seems to push up the compactification scale, causing a reintroduction <lb/>of tuning. A second issue is that the third generation sm fermions also have a large overlap with <lb/>the Higgs and can induce a large Z ¯ bb coupling through the neutral Goldstone. This coupling <lb/>is well measured and would also require some tuning in the couplings. It turns out, however, <lb/>that imposing custodial symmetry in the bulk can address both of these problems [118, 119]. The <lb/>symmetry is typically gauged and broken on the ir brane so that it is holographically identified <lb/>with a global symmetry of the 4D theory—just as in the sm. This introduces several new states <lb/>in the theory, many of which are required to have boundary conditions that prevent zero modes. <lb/> 3.12 A sketch of RS flavor <lb/> Let us assume that the Higgs is effectively ir brane-localized. The effective 4D Yukawa coupling <lb/>between a left-handed quark doublet and a right-handed quark singlet is given by the O(1) anarchic <lb/>(non hierarchicial) 5D Yukawa coupling multiplied by the zero-mode fermion profiles evaluated on <lb/>the ir brane, , <lb/>y <lb/> u <lb/> i  j ∼ O(1)  ij  × <lb/> Q <lb/>i  <lb/> u  R <lb/> j  . <lb/> (3.57) <lb/>Here we have implicitly treated the Higgs boson profile as a δ-function on the ir brane and <lb/>integrated over the profiles. In the 4D mass eigenstate basis, y  t  ∼ 1, we can write <lb/> u  R <lb/> 3  ∼ <lb/> Q <lb/> 3  ∼ 1. <lb/>For a choice of these parameters, one may then use the bottom mass to determine the value of <lb/> d  R <lb/> 3  . This, in turn, may be used in conjunction with the ckm matrix, <lb/> V  CKM≤ij  ∼ O <lb/> Q <lb/>i <lb/> Q <lb/>j <lb/> , <lb/> (3.58) <lb/>to determine the s of lower generations and so forth. One automatically obtains a hierarchical <lb/>pattern of mixing. <lb/>Neutrino zero modes, on the other hand, must be highly peaked on the uv brane. In fact, <lb/>these are typically even more peaked on the uv brane than the Higgs is peaked on the ir brane. <lb/>In other words, one should no longer treat the Higgs as purely brane localized <lb/> 12  and rather as a <lb/>profile which is exponentially small on the uv brane. In this limit, one can treat the right-handed <lb/>neutrinos as each having a δ-function profile on the uv brane. Even with O(1) anarchic Yukawa <lb/>couplings, the smallness of the Higgs profile then suppresses the neutrino mass to automatically <lb/>be small. Further, since each neutrino Yukawa coupling has the same Higgs mass, one finds larger <lb/>mixing than in the quark sector, as phenomenologically observed. <lb/></body>

			<body> 3.13 Example: the coupling of the Z in RS <lb/> As a sample calculation, consider the coupling of the Z boson in rs. We first derive the effective <lb/>4D (sm) coupling of the Z in terms of the 5D parameters and then calculate the fcnc induced <lb/>by the zero mode Z. In the sm the Z is, of course, flavor universal and flavor-changing coupling. <lb/>Indeed, at zeroth order, rs also prevents such a fcnc since the gauge boson zero mode profile is <lb/>flat and therefore universal. We will see, however, that the correction to the Z profile induces a <lb/>small fcnc term. <lb/>Let us first state some results that are derived in the appendix. The localization of the nor-<lb/>malized zero mode fermion profile is controlled by the dimensionless parameter c, <lb/> Ψ <lb/> (0) <lb/> c  (x, z) = <lb/>1 <lb/> √ <lb/> R  <lb/>  z <lb/>R <lb/>  2  z <lb/>R  <lb/>  −c <lb/> f  c  P  L  Ψ <lb/> (0) <lb/> c  (x), <lb/>(3.59) <lb/>where c/R is the fermion bulk mass and P  L  is the left-chiral projection operator. Right chiral <lb/>states differ by P  L  → P  R  and c → −c. We have also used the rs flavor function characterizing the <lb/>fermion profile on the ir brane (larger f means larger overlap with the Higgs), <lb/> f  c  = <lb/> 1 − 2c <lb/>1 − (R/R   )  1−2c  . <lb/> (3.60) <lb/>Each sm fermion has a different bulk mass c which according to the size of its sm Yukawa coupling. <lb/>For simplicity of notation, we will simultaneously use c as the bulk mass parameter and as a flavor <lb/>index rather than c  i  . Further, the profile for the zero mode Z boson is <lb/> h <lb/> (0) <lb/> Z  (z) = <lb/>1 <lb/> R log R   /R <lb/> 1 − <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z <lb/> 4 <lb/> z <lb/> 2  − 2z <lb/> 2  log <lb/> z <lb/>R <lb/> , <lb/> (3.61) <lb/>Starting in the canonical 5D basis where the bulk masses (c parameters) are diagonal, the zero <lb/>mode fermion coupling to the zero mode Z is <lb/> g  4D  Z <lb/> (0) <lb/> µ  (x) ¯ <lb/>Ψ <lb/> (0) <lb/> c  (x)γ <lb/> µ  Ψ <lb/> (0) <lb/> c  (x) + · · · = <lb/> dz <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>  5 <lb/> g  5D  Z <lb/> (0) <lb/> M  (x, z) ¯ <lb/>Ψ <lb/> (0) <lb/> c  (x, z)Γ <lb/> M  Ψ <lb/> (0)  (x, z), <lb/> (3.62) <lb/>where Γ <lb/> M  = <lb/> z <lb/>R <lb/> γ <lb/> M  , the prefactor coming from the vielbein.

See  §19.6 of [123] for a slightly more pedagogical treatment that maintains <lb/>much of the rigor of [121, 122], or Donoghue, et al. for a discussion tied closely to qcd [124]. Very readable <lb/>discussions can be found in [125, 126]. For a rather comprehensive review that emphasizes the role of &apos;gauge&apos; <lb/>symmetries, see [127]. For the composite Higgs see [128] modern set of lectures and [129] for a phenomenological <lb/>review. Finally, see [130, 131] for reviews of the little Higgs scenario. <lb/> For our last topic we explore models where strong dynamics at a scale Λ ∼ 10 tev produces a light, <lb/>composite Higgs. The solution to the Hierarchy problem is that there is no elementary scalar— <lb/>beyond Λ one becomes sensitive to the underlying &apos;partons&apos; that make up the Higgs. Through <lb/>the holographic principle, we have already discussed many broad features of this paradigm in the <lb/>context of warped extra dimensions above. <lb/>One key question to address is the lightness of the Higgs mass. If Λ ∼ 10 tev, how is it that the <lb/>Higgs appears at 125 gev? By comparison, the strong coupling scale for quantum chromodynamics <lb/>is Λ  qcd  ∼ O(300 gev) while most qcd states, such as the ρ meson and proton are at least as heavy <lb/>as this. Those who are sharp with their meson spectroscopy will quickly observe that there is a <lb/>counter-example in qcd: the pions are all lighter than Λ  qcd  , albeit by only an O(1) factor. <lb/>The reason that the pions can be appreciably lighter than the other qcd states is the well-known <lb/>story of chiral perturbation theory a subset of the more general nonlinear Σ model (NLΣM) <lb/>construction. The pions are the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken SU(2)  L  ×SU(2)  R <lb/> flavor symmetry coming from chiral rotations of the up and down quarks. Small explicit breaking <lb/>of this symmetry generates a mass for the pions so that they are pseudo-Goldstone modes. In the <lb/></body>

			<body> composite models that we consider in this lecture we assume a similar structure where the Higgs <lb/>is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of some symmetry for which Λ ≈ 4πf with breaking scale f ≈ 1 <lb/> tev. We show that the generic composite Higgs set up still requires some tuning between the <lb/>electroweak scale v and the symmetry breaking scale f . One way to generate this &apos;little hierarchy&apos; <lb/>is through the mechanism of collective symmetry breaking, which we introduce in the context of <lb/>the little Higgs models. <lb/> 4.1 Pions as Goldstone bosons <lb/> Before exploring composite Higgs models in earnest, it is useful to review strong electroweak <lb/>symmetry breaking in qcd since this gives a concrete example of the effective theory of Goldstone <lb/>bosons. It is also useful because electroweak symmetry breaking in qcd formed the motivation <lb/>for technicolor models that have since fallen out of favor—it is useful to see why this is, and how <lb/>composite Higgs models are different from a revival of technicolor. <lb/>First, consider the Lagrangian for pure qcd: a theory of vector-like quarks and gluons, where <lb/>&apos;vector-like&apos; mean the left-and right-handed quarks come in conjugate representations, <lb/> L  qcd  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> G <lb/> a <lb/> µν  G <lb/> aµν  ¯ <lb/> q(i / <lb/>D − m)q. <lb/> (4.1) <lb/>This is a theory which becomes strongly coupled and confines at low energies, leading to a spectrum <lb/>of composite states. This makes it a good template for our own explorations into compositeness. <lb/>We can already guess that at low energies the effective theory is described by Goldstone bosons, <lb/>the pions. In anticipation, we examine the global symmetries of the theory. <lb/>We focus only on the three lightest quarks with masses m  i  Λ  qcd  . In the chiral limit, m → 0, <lb/>the physical quarks are Weyl spinors and have an enhanced U(3)  L  ×U(3)  R  global flavor symmetry <lb/>acting separately on the left-and right-handed quarks, <lb/> q <lb/> i <lb/>L  → (U  L  ) <lb/> i <lb/>j  q <lb/> j <lb/>L <lb/> (4.2) <lb/> q <lb/> i <lb/>R  → (U  R  ) <lb/> i <lb/>j  q <lb/> j <lb/>R  . <lb/> (4.3) <lb/>One may write the currents for this global symmetry. For compactness we move back to Dirac <lb/>spinors and write in terms of the vector (U  L  = U  R  ) and axial (U  L  = U <lb/>  † <lb/> R  ) transformations: <lb/>(j <lb/> a <lb/>V  ) <lb/> µ  = ¯ <lb/> qγ <lb/> µ  T <lb/> a  q <lb/> (j <lb/> a <lb/>A  ) <lb/> µ  = ¯ <lb/> qγ <lb/> µ  γ  5  T <lb/> a  q <lb/> (4.4) <lb/>(j  V  ) <lb/> µ  = ¯ <lb/> qγ <lb/> µ  q <lb/> (j  A  ) <lb/> µ  = ¯ <lb/> qγ <lb/> µ  γ  5  q, <lb/> (4.5) <lb/>where the T <lb/> a  are the generators of SU(3). We can identify j  V  with baryon number, which is <lb/>conserved in qcd, and we note that j  A  is anomalous so that it is not a good symmetry and we <lb/>don&apos;t expect to see it at low energies <lb/> 13  . The vectorial SU(3), with current j <lb/> a <lb/>V  , is precisely the <lb/>symmetry of Gell-Mann&apos;s eightfold way and can be used to classify the light hadrons. What do <lb/>we make of the axial SU(3), j <lb/> a <lb/>A  ? <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 13  What happens to this symmetry at low energies is rather subtle and was known as the &apos;U(1) problem.&apos; There <lb/>is a lot more to the story than simply saying that the axial U(1) is anomalous and so does not appear at low <lb/>energies. Indeed, one can construct a current out of j  A  and a Chern-Simons (topological) current that is anomaly-<lb/>free and spontaneously broken. This current indeed as a Goldstone pole. However, Kogut and Susskind showed <lb/>that this current is not gauge invariant. There are actually two Goldstone bosons that cancel in any gauge invariant <lb/>operator [132]. <lb/></note>

			<body> Phenomenologically we can observe that the axial SU(3) is not a symmetry of the low energy <lb/>spectrum, otherwise we would expect a parity doubling of all the &apos;eightfold way&apos; multiplets. There <lb/>is one way out: this symmetry must be spontaneously broken. What could possibly enact this <lb/>breaking in a theory with no Higgs boson? It turns out that qcd itself can do the job! We assume <lb/>that the axial SU(3)  A  is broken spontaneously by a quark–anti-quark condensate, <lb/> ¯ qq = ¯ q <lb/> i <lb/> L  q  Ri  + h.c. <lb/> = 0 <lb/>(4.6) <lb/>in such a way that the vector SU(3)  V  is preserved. This is the unique combination that preserves <lb/>Lorentz invariance and breaks SU(3)  A  . By dimensional analysis, this &apos;chiral condensate&apos; takes the <lb/>form ¯ q <lb/> i  q  j  ∼ δ  ij  Λ <lb/> 3 <lb/> qcd  . Given that qcd is strongly interacting in the ir, the existence of this non-<lb/>trivial vacuum condensate should not surprising and is indeed supported by lattice calculations. <lb/>However, the exact mechanism by which this condensate forms is non-perturbative and not fully <lb/>understood. This also gives a robust prediction: we should have eight pseudoscalar Goldstone <lb/>bosons as light excitations. These are precisely the pions, kaons, and η. Because SU(3)  A  is only a <lb/>symmetry in the chiral m → 0 limit, these are not exactly Goldstone bosons as the symmetry is <lb/>explicitly broken by the quark spectrum. However, because this explicit breaking is small relative <lb/>to Λ  qcd  , these excitations are still very light m  π  Λ  qcd  and are often referred to as pseudo-<lb/> Goldstone bosons (sometimes pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone bosons, pngb, in the literature). <lb/>Note that the electroweak group sits inside the qcd flavor symmetry <lb/> 14  , <lb/>SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  × U(1)  B  ⊃ SU(2)  L  × U(1)  Y  . <lb/> (4.7) <lb/>We can see this since an SU(3)  L  fundamental contains (u  L  , d  L  , s  L  ), where the first two components <lb/>form the usual SU(2)  L  first generation quark doublet. In this way, SU(2)  L  is simply the upper left <lb/>2 × 2 component of the SU(3)  L  generators. Similarly, hypercharge is a combination of the diagonal <lb/>generators, <lb/> Y = T  R3  + <lb/> B <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/> (4.8) <lb/>We say that the electroweak group is weakly gauged with respect to low energy qcd. By this we <lb/>mean that the gauge couplings are perturbative in all energy scales of interest. This weak gauge is <lb/>a small explicit breaking of the qcd flavor symmetries and accounts for the mass splitting between <lb/>the π <lb/> 0  and π <lb/> ±  . <lb/> 4.2 A farewell to technicolor <lb/> Because of (4.7), the spontaneous breaking of SU(3)  A  by the chiral condensate ¯ qq also breaks <lb/>electroweak symmetry. This is an important observation: even if there were no Higgs boson, <lb/>electroweak symmetry would still be broken and W and Z bosons would still be massive, albeit <lb/>with a much smaller mass. This mass comes from &apos;eating&apos; part of the appropriately charged <lb/>pseudo-Goldstone bosons. We will see this in slightly more detail below. Readers unfamiliar with <lb/>this story are encouraged to follow the treatment in [133]. <lb/>The observation that strong dynamics can—and indeed, does in qcd—break electroweak sym-<lb/>metry led to the development of technicolor theories where the sm is extended by a confining <lb/></body>

			<body> sector [134–138]. Note that by the holographic interpretation of extra dimensions, this type of elec-<lb/>troweak symmetry breaking is analogous to the rs scenario where a brane-localized Higgs picks <lb/>up a vev. The large hierarchy between the Planck and electroweak scales is the understood to <lb/>be a result of dimensional transmutation. The simplest constructions of these models, however, <lb/>suffer from several issues. These include the requirement for an additional mechanism to generate <lb/>fermion masses [139, 140] and generically large deviations in flavor and electroweak precision ob-<lb/>servables [140–142]. However, the nail in the coffin for most of these models is observation of the <lb/>Higgs boson at 125 gev, much lighter than the compositeness scale. Such a state—even if it is not <lb/>the Standard Model Higgs—is very difficult to explain in the context of these models. <lb/>As such, even though the models we consider here encode strong dynamics, they are distinct <lb/>from the pre-Higgs technicolor strong dynamics of the past. All of these models require a Higgs. <lb/>We will borrow from the above story, however, the importance of the effective theory of pseudo-<lb/>Goldstone bosons. By identifying the Higgs as one of these pion-like states, we can explain its <lb/>lightness. <lb/> 4.3 Chiral Perturbation Theory <lb/> In this section we review the main framework for describing Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry <lb/>breaking, known as chiral perturbation theory. Many of the results highlight general principles <lb/>that appear in any theory of Goldstone bosons, known as nonlinear sigma models. A completely <lb/>general treatment of spontaneously broken global symmetries is captured in the the so-called <lb/>Callan-Coleman-Wess-Zumino (ccwz) construction, which we present in Appendix B.1. <lb/>The importance of having a Lagrangian theory of Goldstone bosons is clear from the success of <lb/> sm predictions before the Higgs discovery. Na¨ vely, one might wonder how we knew so much about <lb/>the Standard Model before the Higgs discovery—isn&apos;t the Higgs a very central piece to the theory? <lb/>As we saw above, the key feature is actually electroweak symmetry breaking: whether or not there <lb/>is a Higgs, one always has the Goldstone bosons which are eaten by the W <lb/> ±  and Z to become <lb/>massive. It is this nonlinear sigma model that pre-Higgs experiments had studied so carefully. The <lb/>discovery of the Higgs is a statement that the nonlinear sigma model is uv completed into a linear <lb/>sigma model. <lb/> 4.3.1 Framework <lb/> We begin with the concrete example of low-energy qcd that we described above. Given that the <lb/>chiral condensate ¯ qq breaks SU(3)  A  , we proceed to write down the effective theory describing <lb/>the interaction of the resulting Goldstone bosons. Let us write U  0  to refer to the direction in field <lb/>space associated with the chiral condensate, U  0  ∼ ¯ qq. This transforms as a bifundamental with <lb/>respect to SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  , <lb/> U (x) → U  L  U (x)U <lb/>  † <lb/> R  , <lb/> (4.9) <lb/>where U  L  and U  R  are the transformation matrices under the SU(3)  L  and SU(3)  R  respectively. The <lb/>observation that SU(3)  A  is broken corresponds to U  0  = 1. Note that this indeed preserves the <lb/>SU(3)  V  transformations U  L  = U  R  . <lb/>We now consider the fluctuations U (x) about U  0  —these are what we identify with the Goldstone <lb/>bosons. Recall the picture of spontaneous symmetry breaking through the &apos;Mexican hat&apos; potential <lb/>in Fig. 8. The action of an unbroken symmetry does not affect the vev (represented by the ball), <lb/></body>

			<body> Figure 8: Cartoon of the Goldstone excitation for a &apos;Mexican hat&apos; potential. Image from [143]. <lb/>while broken symmetries shift the vev along the vacuum manifold. This gives an intuitive picture <lb/>of how to identify the Goldstone modes: <lb/>1. Identify a convenient vev, U  0 <lb/> 2. Act on that vev with the broken group elements <lb/>3. Promote the transformation parameter to a field, identify these with the Goldstones. <lb/>For the chiral Lagrangian, our broken symmetries are those for which U  L  = U <lb/>  † <lb/> R  . Writing U  L  = <lb/>exp(ii <lb/> a  T <lb/> a  ), we act on U  0  = 1, <lb/> e <lb/> ii  a  T  a <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> 1 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>  <lb/> e <lb/> ii  a  T  a  = e <lb/> 2ii  a  T  a  . <lb/> (4.10) <lb/>We now promote the transformation parameter <lb/> a  to Goldstone fields, <lb/> a  ∼ π <lb/> a  (x). Since <lb/> a  is <lb/>dimensionless, in order for π <lb/> a  to have canonical scaling dimension we should rescale by the decay <lb/> constant <lb/> 15  f . We may understand the physical meaning of f if we recall Fig. 8, since we want  to <lb/>be an angle that parameterizes the position along the vacuum circle: the Goldstone is a periodic <lb/>variable with period 2πf , so that f is identified with the value of the symmetry breaking vev. <lb/> The angle  should is then π(x)/f ; where one should be careful not to confuse π(x) ∈ (0, 2π) with <lb/> π = 3.14. We thus promote <lb/> a  → π(x)/f so that we may define the field U (x), <lb/> U (x) = e <lb/> i <lb/> π a (x) <lb/> f <lb/> T  a <lb/> U  0  e <lb/> i <lb/> π a (x) <lb/> r <lb/> T  a  = e <lb/> 2i <lb/> π a (x) <lb/> f <lb/> T  a <lb/> . <lb/> (4.11) <lb/>We now have an object U (x) which packages the Goldstone fields, π <lb/> a  (x). Note that U (x) transforms <lb/>linearly under the full SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  group, U (x) → U  L  U (x)U <lb/>  † <lb/> R  , but the fields that actually <lb/>describe the low energy spectrum are related in a non-trivial way to U (x). <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.3.2 How pions transform <lb/> We can determine the transformation of the pions π <lb/> a  by using the transformation of the linear <lb/>field U (x). Under the SU(3)  V  (unbroken) symmetry, U  L  = U  R  = U  V  , we have <lb/> U (x) → U  V  U (x)U <lb/>  † <lb/> V  = U  V <lb/> 1 + 2i <lb/> π <lb/> a  (x) <lb/> f <lb/>T <lb/> a  + · · · <lb/> U <lb/>  † <lb/> V  , <lb/> (4.12) <lb/>where we can see from the first term that π <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  → U  V  π <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  U <lb/>  † <lb/> V  . In other words, π <lb/> a  (x) <lb/>transforms linearly under the unbroken symmetry. Note that the higher order terms also obey <lb/>this by trivially inserting factors of U <lb/>  † <lb/> V  U  V  = 1. Indeed, we expected this result because we know <lb/>that Gell-Mann&apos;s eightfold way is precisely a realization of SU(3)  V  , so our pions must transform <lb/>as octets. <lb/>Things are not as simple for the broken symmetry, U  L  = U <lb/>  † <lb/> R  = U  A  . In this case the transfor-<lb/>mation is <lb/> U (x) → U  A  U (x)U  A  ≡ e <lb/> 2i <lb/> π a (x) <lb/> f <lb/> T  a <lb/> . <lb/> (4.13) <lb/>In this case the pion does not transform in a nice, linear way <lb/> 16  . Unlike the above case, there is <lb/>no sense in which this looks like π <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  → U  A  π <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  U <lb/>  † <lb/> A  . The best we can do is say that we&apos;ve <lb/>moved U  0  to a new point on the vacuum manifold, which we parameterize by an angle 2π <lb/> a  (x)/f . <lb/>The transformation π <lb/> a  (x) → π <lb/>  a(x) is nonlinear. To leading order, <lb/>1 + 2i <lb/> π <lb/> a  (x) <lb/> f <lb/>T <lb/> a  = (1 + ic <lb/> a  T <lb/> a  ) <lb/> 1 + 2i <lb/> π <lb/> a  (x) <lb/> f <lb/>T <lb/> a <lb/> (1 + ic <lb/> a  T <lb/> a  ) <lb/>(4.14) <lb/>so that <lb/> π <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  = π <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  + f c <lb/> a  T <lb/> a  . <lb/> (4.15) <lb/>In other words, to leading order the pion shifts π <lb/> a  → f c <lb/> a  . This shift symmetry in the nonlinear <lb/>realization is precisely why the pion is massless; the only non-trivial pion Lagrangian terms must <lb/>carry derivatives. <lb/> Coset space description. In anticipation of the more general ccwz construction, let us restate the above <lb/>arguments in a more compact way. The symmetry breaking pattern is the coset SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  /SU(3)  V  . <lb/>Using the notation above, this means that group elements of the full symmetry U  L,R  can be written as a <lb/>product of elements of the unbroken group U  V  and the [left] coset U  A  ∈ SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  /SU(3)  V  , <lb/> U  L  = U  A  U  V <lb/> U  R  = U <lb/>  † <lb/> A  U  V  . <lb/> (4.16) <lb/>One can check that this matches the above cases when one sets U  A  = 1 or U  V  = 1. The general transformation <lb/>of the linear packaging of the pions, U (x) = exp (2iπ <lb/> a  (x)T <lb/> a  /f ), is <lb/> U (x) → U  A <lb/> U  V  U (x)U <lb/>  † <lb/> V <lb/> U  A  . <lb/> (4.17) <lb/>From here it is clear that SU(3)  V  is realized linearly while SU(3)  A  is realized non-linearly. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 16  This may seem confusing since U (x) transforms as a bifundamental under SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  . However, compo-<lb/>nents of U (x) are not independent due to the nonlinear constraints of being unitary and having unit determinant. <lb/></note>

			<body> SU(3)  A  is not a subgroup of SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  . While one can divide the algebra of SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R <lb/> into axial and vector generators, one should note that there is no such thing as an &apos;axial subgroup&apos; of SU(3)  L  × <lb/> SU(3)  R  . One can check that the commutation relations of axial generators include vector generators so that <lb/>the SU(3)  A  algebra doesn&apos;t close by itself. <lb/> 4.3.3 Lagrangian description <lb/> Thus far we have found a convenient way to package the Goldstone fields π <lb/> a  (x) into a linear <lb/>realization of the full SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  symmetry. We would like to write down a Lagrangian <lb/>describing the dynamics of the Goldstones. Our strategy will be to write the lowest order terms <lb/>in U (x) that are SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  invariant and then expand U (x) in Goldstone excitations about <lb/> U  0  . One can see that many invariants, such as U (x) <lb/>  †  U (x), are independent of the Goldstones. In <lb/>fact, only derivative terms contain the Goldstone fields. This is consistent with our argument that <lb/>Goldstones must have derivative couplings. The lowest order non-trivial term is <lb/> L = <lb/> f <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/>Tr <lb/> ∂ <lb/> µ  U <lb/>  †  (x) <lb/> ∂  µ  U (x) <lb/> (4.18) <lb/>The pre-factor is fixed by expanding U (x) = 1 + 2i <lb/> π  a  (x) <lb/> f <lb/> T <lb/> a  and ensuring that the kinetic term for <lb/> π <lb/> a  (x) is canonically normalized. Note that we&apos;ve used the normalization that Tr T <lb/> a  T <lb/> b  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> δ <lb/> ab  . <lb/>Note that even with this leading term, we have and expansion of (non-renormalizable) pion–pion <lb/>interactions. <lb/>Next we weakly gauge the electroweak group. Recall that this sits in SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  ×U(1)  B  . <lb/>The left-and right-chiral quarks are fundamentals under SU(3)  L  and SU(3)  R  respectively and have <lb/>baryon number 1/3. This information, combined with knowing how SU(2)  L  sits in SU(3)  L  and <lb/>(4.8) determines the quantum numbers of the linear field U (x), which transforms as a ¯ <lb/> 3 × 3 × 0 <lb/>under SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  ×U(1)  B  . To &apos;turn on&apos; the electroweak gauge interactions, we simply promote <lb/>derivatives to covariant derivatives ∂  µ  → D  µ  where <lb/> D  µ  U (x) <lb/> i <lb/>j  = ∂  µ  U (x) <lb/> i <lb/>j  − igW <lb/> a <lb/>µ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(τ <lb/> a  ) <lb/> i <lb/>k  U (x) <lb/> k <lb/>j  + ig <lb/>  B  µ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> T <lb/> 3 <lb/> R <lb/>  k <lb/>i <lb/> U (x) <lb/> i <lb/>k  . <lb/> (4.19) <lb/>Here we&apos;ve written <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> τ <lb/> a  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>  <lb/>  τ <lb/> a  0 <lb/> 0 0 0 <lb/>  <lb/> ⊂ SU(3)  L  . <lb/> (4.20) <lb/>Promoting ∂  µ  → D  µ  in (4.18) yields <lb/> L = <lb/> f <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/>Tr <lb/> ∂  µ  − <lb/> ig <lb/> 2 <lb/> W <lb/> a <lb/>µ  (x)τ <lb/> a <lb/> U (x) <lb/> 2 <lb/> + · · · , <lb/> (4.21) <lb/>where we omit the similar term with B  µ  (x). <lb/> 4.3.4 Electroweak symmetry breaking <lb/> One may check that (4.21) has terms that are linear in W (x) such as <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> f W <lb/> + <lb/> µ  (x)∂ <lb/> µ  π <lb/> −  (x) + h.c. This <lb/>is precisely a mixing term between the π <lb/> +  (x) and the W <lb/> + <lb/> µ  (x). In other words, the W has eaten the <lb/></body>

In <lb/>other words, <lb/> iΠ  µν  (q) = J <lb/> + <lb/> µ  (q)J <lb/> − <lb/> ν  (−q). <lb/>(4.25) <lb/>The qcd corrected W propagator ∆  µν  (q) from resumming the diagrams in (4.23) is <lb/>∆  µν  (q) = <lb/> −i <lb/> q  2  − g  2  Π(q  2  )/2 <lb/>Π  µν  (q) = <lb/> η  µν  − <lb/> q  µ  q  ν <lb/> q  2 <lb/> Π(q <lb/> 2  ). <lb/>(4.26) <lb/>The observation that a charged pion has been &apos;eaten&apos; to make the W massive is the statement <lb/>that Π  µν  (q <lb/> 2  ) has a zero-momentum pole. Indeed, 0|J <lb/> + <lb/> µ  |π <lb/> −  (p) = if  π  p  µ  / <lb/> √ <lb/> 2. The qcd blobs in <lb/>(4.23) also encode, however, the effects of heavier resonances and has poles at the masses of these <lb/>states. In the &apos;large N &apos; limit (large number of colors) one may write the current-current correlation <lb/>function as a sum of resonances [144–146], <lb/> η  µν  − <lb/> q  µ  q  ν <lb/> q  2 <lb/> Π(q <lb/> 2  ) = <lb/> q <lb/> 2  η  µν  − q  µ  q  ν <lb/> n <lb/> f <lb/> 2 <lb/> n <lb/> q  2  − m  2 <lb/> n <lb/> , <lb/> (4.27) <lb/>where the Goldstone pole appears for m  0  = 0. <lb/> 4.3.5 Electromagnetic mass splitting <lb/> In addition to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by strong dynamics, the SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R <lb/> group is also broken explicitly from the gauging of U(1)  EM  ⊂ SU(3)  V  . The neutral Goldstones <lb/>(pions, kaons, and the η) are unaffected by this. The charged Goldstones, on the other hand, pick <lb/>up masses from photon loop diagrams of the form in Fig. 9. These diagrams contribute to an <lb/>operator that gives a shift in the [pseudo-]Goldstone mass, <lb/>∆L ∼ e <lb/> 2  Tr <lb/> QU (x) <lb/>  †  QU (x) <lb/> , <lb/> (4.28) <lb/></body>

Despite the silly appearance, the key point is that <lb/>the photon couples to the electric current J  µ  = e ¯ <lb/>Ψγ  µ  Ψ (&apos;ears&apos;) formed from interactions with <lb/>fundamental quarks in the strongly coupled sector. The &apos;whiskers&apos; are the pseudo-Goldstone <lb/>external states when expanding the U (x) field in (4.28). The contribution to the charged meson <lb/>masses come from the &apos;two whisker&apos; diagram. <lb/>where Q = <lb/> 1 <lb/> 3 <lb/> diag(2, −1, −1) is the matrix of quark electric charges. Since the electromagnetic <lb/>force does not distinguish between the down and strange quarks, this diagram gives an equal shift <lb/>to both the charged pions (e.g. u ¯ <lb/> d) and kaons (e.g. u¯ s). Since the up and anti-down/strange quark <lb/>have the same charge, the bound state is more energetic than the neutral mesons and we expect the <lb/>shift in the mass-squared to be positive [147, 148]. Note that the contribution to the charged pion <lb/>mass is quadratically sensitive to the chiral symmetry breaking scale, though it is also suppressed <lb/>by the smallness of α  EM  . <lb/> 4.3.6 Explicit breaking from quark spectrum <lb/> One can add quark masses that are a small (m  q  Λ  qcd  ) explicit breaking of the global symmetry <lb/>and generate small masses to the pseudo-Goldstone bosons. One can write this as a spurion <lb/> M = diag(m  u  , m  d  , m  s  ) which has the same quantum numbers as U (x). One can add these terms to <lb/>the effective Lagrangian by forming the appropriate global symmetry group invariant. In particular, <lb/>we add to the Lagrangian <lb/>∆L ∼ Tr [M U (x)] ∼ Tr <lb/> M <lb/> π <lb/> a  (x) <lb/> f <lb/>T <lb/> a <lb/>  2 <lb/> + · · · <lb/> (4.29) <lb/>In the limit where m  u  = m  d  and ignoring the electromagnetic splitting above, one may identify the <lb/>masses for the pions, kaons, and η (different components of π <lb/> a  ) to derive the Gell-Mann–Okubo <lb/>relation, <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> η  + m <lb/> 2 <lb/> π  = 4m <lb/> 2 <lb/> K  . <lb/> (4.30) <lb/> 4.3.7 When the theory breaks down <lb/> Finally, let us note that the effective Lagrangian for pions is non-renormalizable, so we should <lb/>say something about the cutoff for this theory. At tree-level, the two-to-two scattering of pions <lb/>with characteristic momentum p goes like p <lb/> 2  /f <lb/> 2  from (4.18). Using na¨ ve dimensional analysis <lb/>(nda) [149–151], we see that the loop contributions go like <lb/> ∼ <lb/> d ¯ <lb/> 4  k <lb/> p <lb/> 2  k <lb/> 2 <lb/> f  4 <lb/> 1 <lb/> k  4  ∼ <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2  p <lb/> 2 <lb/> 16π  2  f  4  . ∼ <lb/>× <lb/> Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> 16π  2  f  2  , <lb/> (4.31) <lb/></body>

			<body> where we have used the shift symmetry (the full SU(3) <lb/> 2  group structure) to tell us that at the <lb/>numerator of the integrand carries at least two powers of the external momenta. Validity of our <lb/>loop expansion thus requires that Λ ∼ 4πf ∼ gev, and this is indeed the scale at which additional <lb/> qcd states appear. <lb/>Indeed, this uv behavior of the theory of Goldstones is one of the reasons why we expected <lb/>either the Higgs or something new to be manifest at the lhc: the sm without a Higgs is simply <lb/>a nonlinear sigma model. By the Goldstone equivalence theorem, the scattering cross section for <lb/>longitudinal W boson scattering grows linearly with the center of mass energy. In order to maintain <lb/>unitarity, one requires that either there is a Higgs boson (a linearization of the nonlinear sigma <lb/>model) or that the theory becomes strongly coupled so that higher order terms cancel the poor <lb/>behavior. <lb/> 4.4 Composite [pseudo-Goldstone] Higgs <lb/> The main idea for composite Higgs models is that the Higgs mass parameter is protected against <lb/>quadratic quantum corrections because it is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. This should be contrasted <lb/>with the solutions to the Hierarchy problem already discussed: <lb/> • Supersymmetry: extended spacetime symmetry cancels these corrections through the intro-<lb/>duction of different-spin partners. <lb/> • Extra dimensions: the fundamental scale cutoff for the quadratic corrections is actually much <lb/>lower than the 4D Planck scale. <lb/> • Technicolor/warped extra dimensions: the Higgs itself is composite so that above the com-<lb/>positeness scale it no longer behaves like a fundamental scalar. <lb/>Note, in particular, that the composite Higgs scenario we&apos;re interested in is distinct from techni-<lb/>color: the pseudo-Goldstone nature of the Higgs is an explanation for why the Higgs mass is so <lb/>much lighter than the other bound states in the strongly coupled sector. <lb/>Goldstone bosons, however, behave very differently from the Standard Model Higgs. We saw <lb/>that Goldstone bosons have derivative couplings owing to their shift symmetry. The Higgs, on the <lb/>other hand, has Yukawa couplings and the all important electroweak symmetry-breaking potential. <lb/>Our goal in this section is to see how to construct a theory of Goldstones which can produce a <lb/>Higgs particle that has all of the required couplings of the sm Higgs. <lb/>We shall closely follow the discussion in [128] and refer the reader there for further details and <lb/>references. <lb/> 4.4.1 The framework <lb/> Start with a large global symmetry group G, analogous to the &apos;large&apos; SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  global <lb/>symmetry of low energy qcd. We will break this symmetry in two ways: <lb/>1. We assume that the strong dynamics spontaneously breaks G to a subgroups H  global  . This <lb/>is analogous to chiral symmetry breaking in qcd, SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  → SU(3)  V  . <lb/>2. In addition to this, we will explicitly break G by weakly gauging a subgroup H  gauge  which <lb/>contains the sm electroweak group SU(2)  L  × U(1)  Y  . This is analogous to the gauging of <lb/>U(1)  EM  . <lb/></body>

(left, tree level) Strong dynamics breaks G → H  global <lb/> spontaneously, while H  gauge  ⊂ G is explicitly broken through gauging. The unbroken group H = <lb/> H  gauge  ∩ H  global  contains the sm electroweak group, SU(2)  L  × U(1)  Y  . (right, loop level) Vacuum <lb/>misalignment from sm interactions shifts the unbroken group H → H <lb/>  and breaks the electroweak <lb/>group to U(1)  EM  . The degree of misalignment is parametrized by ξ, the squared ratio of the ewsb <lb/>vev to the G → H vev. Adapted from [152]. <lb/>We assume that the sm electroweak group is a subgroup of H = H  gauge  ∪ H  global  so that it is <lb/>gauged and preserved by the strong dynamics. This is shown on the left of Fig. 10. This results <lb/>in dim H  gauge  transverse gauge bosons and (dim G − dim H  global  ) Goldstone bosons. The breaking <lb/> G → H  global  also breaks some of the gauge group so that there are a total of (dim H  gauge  − H) <lb/> massive gauge bosons and (dim G − dim H) &apos;uneaten&apos; massless Goldstones. <lb/>Now we address the white elephant of the Higgs interactions—can we bequeath to our Goldstone <lb/>bosons the necessary non-derivative interactions to make one of them a realistic Higgs candidate? <lb/>This is indeed possible through vacuum misalignment, which we illustrate on the right of Fig. 10. <lb/>The explicit gauging of H  gauge  makes loop-level corrections to the dynamical symmetry breaking <lb/>pattern. This is analogous to how the gauged U(1)  EM  splits the masses of the charged and neutral <lb/>pions through a photon loop. Loops of sm gauge bosons can generate an electroweak symmetry <lb/>breaking potential for the Higgs. We illustrate this below. <lb/>One key point here is that since the Higgs potential is generated dynamically through sm gauge <lb/>interactions, the electroweak scale v is distinct from the G → H symmetry breaking scale f . The <lb/>&apos;angle&apos; <lb/> ξ = <lb/> v <lb/>f <lb/>  2 <lb/> (4.32) <lb/>parameterizes this separation of scales quantifies the degree of vacuum misalignment. Note that <lb/>this is a separation of scales which does not exist in technicolor and is the key to parameterizing <lb/>how the Higgs remains light relative to the heavier resonances despite not being a &apos;true&apos; Goldstone <lb/>boson. The limits ξ → 0 and ξ → 1 correspond to the sm (heavy states completely decoupled) <lb/>and minimal technicolor, respectively. We note that this parameter is also a source of tuning in <lb/>realistic composite Higgs models. One notes that once the pseudo-Goldstone Higgs state is given <lb/>non-derivative interactions, there are again quadratic divergences at loop level. This leads to an <lb/>expected O(1%) tuning. <lb/>We have the following constraints for picking a symmetry breaking pattern: <lb/> 1. The sm electroweak group is a subgroup of the unbroken group, SU(2)  L  × U(1)  Y  ⊂ H. In <lb/></body>

			<body> fact, it is better to have the full custodial SU(2)  L  × SU(2)  R  ∼ = SO(4) group embedded in H <lb/> since this will protect against large contributions to the Peskin-Takeuchi T -parameter. <lb/>2. There is at least one pseudo-Goldstone boson with the quantum numbers of the sm Higgs. <lb/>To protect against the T -parameter, it is better to have a (2, 2) under the custodial group. <lb/>At this point we have said nothing about the sm fermions. These will have to couple to the <lb/>strong sector to generate Yukawa couplings with the Higgs. We show below that a reasonable <lb/>way to do this is to allow the sm fermions to be partially composite, a scheme that we had <lb/>already seen in the holographic interpretation of the rs scenario. Indeed, extra dimensions provide <lb/>a natural language to construct composite Higgs models. <lb/> 4.4.2 Minimal Composite Higgs: set up <lb/> We now consider an explicit example, the minimal composite Higgs model, which was explored <lb/>in [153, 154] using the intuition from the rs framework. Following the guidelines set above, we <lb/>would like to choose choose H  global  = SO(4), the custodial group which is the minimal choice to <lb/>protect the T -parameter. However, as we know from left-right symmetric models, the SO(4) = <lb/>SU(2)  L  × SU(2)  R  charge assignments don&apos;t give the correct U(1)  Y  charges. Thus our &apos;minimal&apos; <lb/>choice for H  global  requires an additional U(1)  X  so that one may include hypercharge in the unbroken <lb/>group, H, <lb/>Y = (T <lb/> R  ) <lb/> 3  + X. <lb/> (4.33) <lb/>We then choose G = SO(5)×U(1)  X  and introduce a linear field Σ that is an SO(5) fundamental and <lb/>uncharged under U(1)  X  . Note that we can ignore the U(1)  X  charge in our spontaneous symmetry <lb/>breaking analysis since it&apos;s really just &apos;coming along for the ride&apos; at this point. Σ acquires a vev <lb/> to break SO(5) → SO(4), <lb/> Σ = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1) <lb/> T  . <lb/> (4.34) <lb/>This is analogous to the qcd chiral condensate. We can now follow the intuition we developed <lb/>with chiral perturbation theory. The Goldstone bosons of this breaking are given by transforming <lb/>this vev by the broken generators. A useful parameterization of the four broken generators is <lb/> T <lb/> ˆ <lb/> a <lb/>ij  = <lb/> i <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 <lb/> δ <lb/> k <lb/>i  δ <lb/> 5 <lb/> j  − δ <lb/> k <lb/>j  δ <lb/> 5 <lb/> i <lb/> , <lb/> (4.35) <lb/>wherê <lb/> a ∈ {1, · · · 4}. We have used â to run only over the broken generators. We refer to the <lb/>unbroken generators with an undecorated index: T <lb/> a  . The linear field Σ can then be decomposed <lb/>into the Goldstone pieces h <lb/> ˆ <lb/> a  (x) and a radial component h(x) = <lb/> h  ˆ <lb/> a  (x)h  ˆ <lb/> a  (x), <lb/>Σ = e <lb/> ih  â  (x)T  ˆ <lb/> a  /f  Σ = <lb/>sin(h/f ) <lb/> h <lb/> h <lb/> 1  , h <lb/> 2  , h <lb/> 3  , h <lb/> 4  , h cot(h/f ) <lb/> . <lb/> (4.36) <lb/>With this parameterization the sm Higgs doublet is <lb/> H = <lb/> h <lb/> 1  + ih <lb/> 2 <lb/> h <lb/> 3  + ih <lb/> 4 <lb/> . <lb/> (4.37) <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.4.3 Gauge couplings <lb/> We would like to write down a Lagrangian for this theory and parameterize the effects of the <lb/>strong sector on the sm couplings. A useful trick for this is to pretend that the global SO(5) × <lb/> U(1)  X  symmetry is gauged and then treat the additional gauge fields as spurions. We can then <lb/>parameterize the contributions to the quadratic part of the full SO(5) [partially spurious] gauge <lb/>bosons, V  µ  = A <lb/> a <lb/>µ  T <lb/> a  + A <lb/> ˆ <lb/> a <lb/>µ  T <lb/> ˆ <lb/> a  , and the U(1)  X  gauge boson X, <lb/> ∆L = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> η <lb/> µν  + <lb/> q <lb/> µ  q <lb/> ν <lb/> q  2 <lb/> Π  X  (q <lb/> 2  )X  µ  X  ν  + Π  0  (q <lb/> 2  )Tr(A  µ  A  ν  ) + Π  1  (q <lb/> 2  )Tr(ΣA  µ  A  ν  Σ <lb/> T  ) <lb/> . <lb/> (4.38) <lb/>The physical content of expansion equation is identical to the diagrammatic expansion of the qcd <lb/> corrections to the massive gauge boson propagators in (4.23) and the form factors are completely <lb/>analogous to (4.25) and (4.26). Contained in this expression are the kinetic and mass terms of the <lb/> sm electroweak gauge bosons. To extract them, we must expand the form factors Π(q <lb/> 2  ) in momenta <lb/>and identify the O(q <lb/> 0  ) terms as mass terms and the O(q <lb/> 2  ) terms as kinetic terms. Recall that <lb/>these form factors encode the exchange of bound states from the strong dynamics. From (4.27) <lb/>we note that at small q <lb/> 2  , the only non-trivial form factors are those which include the exchange <lb/>of a Goldstone mode. These are precisely the terms associated with the G/H  global  directions and <lb/>hence the A <lb/> ˆ <lb/> a  fields. Since the Π  X  and Π  0  terms include gauge fields in the unbroken directions, <lb/>they cannot have a zero-momentum pole. The Π  1  term, however, selects out the broken direction <lb/>upon inserting the Σ → Σ  0  and thus contains the Goldstone pole, <lb/>Π  0  (0) = Π  X  (0) = 0 <lb/>Π  1  (0) = f <lb/> 2  . <lb/> (4.39) <lb/>Assuming that the Higgs obtains a vev, one may rotate it into a convenient location (h <lb/> 1  , · · · , h <lb/> 4  ) = <lb/>(0, 0, v, 0) corresponding to the usual sm Higgs vev parameterization. We now assume that H  gauge <lb/> is the sm electroweak group and drop all spurious gauge bosons. To O(q <lb/> 2  ), the strong sector <lb/>contribution to the Lagrangian of these gauge bosons is <lb/>∆L  q  0  = <lb/> η <lb/> µν  + <lb/> q <lb/> µ  q <lb/> ν <lb/> q  2 <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> f <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/>sin <lb/> 2  h <lb/> f <lb/> B  µ  B  ν  + W <lb/> 3 <lb/> µ  W <lb/> 3 <lb/> ν  − 2W <lb/> 3 <lb/> µ  B  ν  + 2W <lb/> + <lb/> µ  W <lb/> − <lb/> ν <lb/> (4.40) <lb/>∆L  q  2  = <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2 <lb/> Π <lb/> 0  (0)W <lb/> a <lb/>µ  W <lb/> a <lb/>ν  + (Π <lb/> 0  (0) + Π <lb/> X  (0)) B  µ  B  ν <lb/> , <lb/> (4.41) <lb/>where we&apos;ve used the choice SO(5) generators in the appendix of [155]. ∆L  q  2  gives contributions <lb/>to the kinetic terms of the gauge bosons. Note that these are not canonically normalized, but <lb/>instead can be thought of as shifts in the gauge coupling, <lb/>∆ <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  2 <lb/> = −Π <lb/> 0  (0) <lb/>∆ <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  2 <lb/> = − (Π <lb/> 0  (0) + Π <lb/> X  (0)) . <lb/> (4.42) <lb/>Thus if the SU(2)  L  gauge bosons have a &apos;pure&apos; gauge coupling g  0  when one turns off the strongly <lb/>coupled sector, the full observed SU(2)  L  gauge coupling is <lb/>1 <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/>SM <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/>0 <lb/> − Π <lb/> 0  (0), <lb/>(4.43) <lb/>and similarly for g <lb/> SM  . <lb/>∆L  q  0  corresponds to contributions the masses of the heavy electroweak gauge bosons. Taking <lb/>into account the need to canonically normalize with respect to ∆L  q  2  , we obtain the usual W <lb/> ±  and <lb/></body>

The key is the expansion <lb/> f <lb/> 2  sin <lb/> 2  h(x) <lb/>f <lb/> = v <lb/> 2  + 2v <lb/> 1 − ξh(x) + (1 + 2ξ)h(x) <lb/> 2  + · · · . <lb/> (4.45) <lb/>From this we can make a prediction for the SO(5)/SO(4) composite Higgs couplings to the heavy <lb/>electroweak gauge bosons V = W <lb/> ±  , Z relative to their sm values, <lb/> g  V V h  = <lb/> 1 − ξg <lb/> SM <lb/> V V h <lb/> g  V V hh  = (1 − 2ξ)g <lb/> SM <lb/> V V hh  . <lb/> (4.46) <lb/>We should be absolutely clear at this point that these couplings introduce gauge boson loops which <lb/>are, themselves, quadratically divergent. These loops go like <lb/> ∼ <lb/> g <lb/> 2 <lb/> 16π  2  Λ <lb/> 2  ∼ g <lb/> 2 <lb/>SM  (1 − ξ)f <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (4.47) <lb/>where we&apos;ve used the dimensional analysis limit Λ = 4πf . We see that having explained the <lb/>lightness of the Higgs by appealing to the Goldstone shift symmetry, reintroducing the Higgs <lb/>couplings to the gauge bosons breaks this shift symmetry and wants to push the Higgs mass back <lb/>up towards the symmetry breaking scale. For now we accept this as a tuning on ξ; we return to <lb/>this point in the little Higgs models discussed below. <lb/> 4.4.4 Partial compositeness <lb/> Having introduced the Higgs couplings to the gauge bosons, we can move on to finding a way to <lb/>incorporate the Yukawa couplings into composite Higgs models. The way this is done in technicolor <lb/>is to introduce a four-Fermi interaction that is bilinear in sm fields, e.g. <lb/>∆L ∼ ( ¯ <lb/> Q  L  u  R  )( ¯ <lb/> ψ  TC  ¯ <lb/> ψ  TC  ) <lb/>(4.48) <lb/>where the ( ¯ <lb/> ψ  TC  ¯ <lb/> ψ  TC  ) factor encodes the dynamics of the strong sector &apos;quarks&apos; and is assumed <lb/>to interpolate the Higgs <lb/> 18  . The resulting Yukawa coupling is shown in Fig. 11a. This strategy <lb/>typically runs afoul of constraints on cp violation and flavor-changing neutral currents since you <lb/>can imagine the composite sector similarly generating a four-fermion operator between sm states. <lb/>Instead of connecting the strong sector to a sm fermion bilinear, we can consider a linear <lb/> connection. This is known as partial compositeness and is shown in Fig. 11b. We assume that <lb/>instead of (4.48), the fermions couple according to <lb/>∆L ∼ ¯ <lb/> Q  L  O  Q  L  , <lb/> (4.49) <lb/></body>

Let us parameterize the elementary– <lb/>composite mixing by &apos;angles&apos; , <lb/> |observed particle ∼ |elementary + |composite. <lb/> (4.50) <lb/>We can use this degree of compositeness to control flavor violation. Since the strongest flavor <lb/>constraints are for the first two generations, we assume that the first two generations have very <lb/>small mixing with the composite sector. This suppresses dangerous flavor-violating four-fermion <lb/>operators. On the other hand, we may assume that the third particles are more composite than <lb/>the first two generations, <lb/> 3   1,2  . <lb/> (4.51) <lb/> Since the degree of compositeness also controls the interaction with the Higgs, this means that <lb/>the third generation particles have a larger Yukawa coupling and, upon electroweak symmetry <lb/>breaking, have heavier masses. The astute reader will note that this is exactly the same as the <lb/>flavor structure of the &apos;realistic&apos; Randall-Sundrum models in Sec. 3.11-3.12. The observation that <lb/>light fermions can automatically avoid flavor bounds is precisely what we called the &apos;rs gim <lb/> mechanism.&apos; This is no surprise since the holographic interpretation of the rs model is indeed one <lb/>where the Higgs is composite. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.4.5 Breaking electroweak symmetry <lb/> Having addressed the Higgs couplings to both the sm gauge bosons and fermions, we move on <lb/>to the Higgs self-couplings. Until now we have simply assumed that the strong sector generates <lb/>an electroweak-symmetry breaking potential. We now check that this assumption is plausible by <lb/>arguing that loops involving the third generation quarks generate the potential similarly to the <lb/>Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model [161, 162]. <lb/>The sm fermions do not form complete representations of the global group G = SO(5) × U (1)  X  . <lb/>We thus follow the same strategy that we used for the gauge bosons in Sec. 4.4.3. Let us promote <lb/>the sm fermions to full SO(5) spinor representations, <lb/>Ψ  Q  = <lb/> Q  L <lb/> χ  Q <lb/> Ψ  u  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> ψ  u <lb/> u  R <lb/> χ  u <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> Ψ  d  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> ψ  d <lb/> χ  d <lb/> d  R <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (4.52) <lb/>where the dashed line separates the SU(2)  L  × SU(2)  R  parts of SO(4) ⊂ SO(5). The ψ and χ fields <lb/>are spurions. Recall from Sec. A.3.1 that the fundamental spinor representation for SO(5) is a <lb/>Dirac spinor which decomposes into two Weyl spinors. Do not confuse these Weyl spinors (4.52) <lb/>with Poincaré representations—these are representations of the global SO(5) internal group. In <lb/>other words, the entire Ψ multiplet are Weyl spinors with respect to Poincaré symmetry but are <lb/>Dirac spinors with respct to the internal SO(5) symmetry. The upper half of the Dirac Ψ spinors <lb/>are charged under SU(2)  L  while the lower half is charged under SU(2)  R  . This imposes a U (1)  X <lb/> charge of 1/6 on the Ψ fields to give the correct hypercharge assignments on the sm fields. <lb/>Now let us parameterize the strong sector dynamics in the couplings of the SO(5) fermions Ψ <lb/>and the linear field Σ in (4.36) that encodes the composite Higgs. Since the Σ is an SO(5) vector, <lb/>it can appear in a fermion bilinear as Σ  i  Γ <lb/> i  , where the Γ are the 5D Euclidean space representation <lb/>of the Clifford algebra. The effective sm fermion bilinear terms are <lb/> L = <lb/> r=Q,u,d <lb/> ¯ <lb/>Ψ  r/  p [Π  r0  + Π  r1  (Γ · Σ)] Ψ  r  + <lb/> r=u,d <lb/> ¯ <lb/>Ψ  Q/  p [M  r0  + M  r1  (Γ · Σ)] Ψ  r  + h.c. <lb/>(4.53) <lb/>where, as before, the form factors Π and M are momentum-dependent. We shall focus on only the <lb/> Q  L  and t  R  pieces since they have the largest coupling to the strong sector. <lb/> Keeping track of conjugate fields. One should be careful with the conjugate fields in the above expression. <lb/>For the Lorentz group in three and four dimensions, SO(3,1) and SO(4,1), we use the Dirac conjugate ¯ <lb/>Ψ ≡ Ψ <lb/>  †  γ <lb/> 0 <lb/> to form Lorentz invariants. Recall that this is because objects like Ψ <lb/>  †  Ψ are not necessarily invariant because <lb/>representations of the Lorentz group are not unitary—boosts acting on the spinor representation do not satisfy <lb/> U <lb/>  †  U = 1. This is due to the relative sign between the timelike and spacelike directions in the Minkowski metric. <lb/>The Dirac conjugate is a way around this. For the case of the G = SO(5) internal symmetry, however, there <lb/>is no issue of non-unitarity. Hence no additional Γ <lb/> 0  (acting on the internal SO(5) space) is necessary in the <lb/>Lagrangian. To be clear, we can write out the spacetime γ and internal Γ matrices explicitly: <lb/>¯ <lb/>Ψ = Ψ <lb/>  †  γ <lb/> 0  = Ψ <lb/>  †  γ <lb/> 0  Γ <lb/> 0  . <lb/> (4.54) <lb/> The matrix Γ · Σ takes the form <lb/>Γ · Σ = <lb/>1 <lb/> h <lb/> h cos(h/f ) / <lb/>h sin(h/f ) <lb/> / <lb/> ¯ <lb/> h sin(h/f ) −h cos(h/f ) <lb/> , <lb/> (4.55) <lb/></body>

			<body> where / <lb/> h and / <lb/> ¯ <lb/> h are appropriate contractions with Pauli matrices. With the above caveat that <lb/>there is no Γ <lb/> 0  acting on the SO(5) conjugate, we may write out the Lagrangian for Q  L  and t  R  by <lb/>dropping the spurious components of the Ψ fields, <lb/> L = ¯ <lb/> Q  L/  p [Π  Q0  + Π  Q1  cos(h/f )] Q  L  + ¯ <lb/> t  R/  p [Π  t0  + Π  t1  cos(h/f )] t  R  + ¯ <lb/> Q  L  M  u1  [h sin(h/f )H <lb/> c  ] t  R  , <lb/> (4.56) <lb/>where H <lb/> c  = iσ <lb/> 2  H is the usual conjugate Higgs doublet in the sm <lb/> 20  . Observe that upon canonical <lb/>normalization, the top mass can be read off the Yukawa term, <lb/> m <lb/> 2 <lb/> t  = <lb/> v <lb/>f <lb/>  2 <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> t1 <lb/> (Π  Q0  + Π  Q1  ) (Π  t0  − Π  t1  ) <lb/> , <lb/> (4.57) <lb/>where the form factors are evaluated at zero momentum. One may write similar expressions for <lb/>the other fermions. <lb/>In order to determine whether electroweak symmetry is broken, we can now plug this infor-<lb/>mation into the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the Higgs, also known as the [quantum] effective <lb/>potential. This is the potential term in the effective action after taking into account quantum <lb/>corrections from integrating out the top quarks. In other words, it is the potential that determines <lb/>the vacuum expectation value of fields. The result is <lb/> V  CW  = −6 <lb/> d ¯ <lb/> 4  p log <lb/> Π  Q0  + Π  Q1  cos <lb/> h <lb/>f <lb/> (4.58) <lb/>+ log <lb/> p <lb/> 2 <lb/> Π  Q0  + Π  Q1  cos <lb/> h <lb/>f <lb/> Π  t0  − Π  t1  cos <lb/> h <lb/>f <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> t1  sin <lb/> 2  v <lb/>f <lb/> . <lb/> (4.59) <lb/>Expanding this to first order and keeping the leading order terms in the Higgs gives <lb/> V  CW  (h) = α cos <lb/> h <lb/>f <lb/> − β sin <lb/> 2  h <lb/>f <lb/>, <lb/> (4.60) <lb/>where α and β are integrals over functions of the form factors where β is typically of the order the <lb/>top Yukawa. If α ≤ 2β, then the Higgs acquires a vev parameterized by <lb/> ξ ≡ sin <lb/> 2  h <lb/> f <lb/> = 1 − <lb/> α <lb/> 2β <lb/>  2 <lb/> . <lb/> (4.61) <lb/>This means that a small ξ typically requires a cancellation between α and β. Since these come <lb/>from different sources, this is generically a tuning in the theory. <lb/>One can also ask if it was necessary to rely on the top quark. For example, we know that the <lb/>gauge sector also breaks the Goldstone shift symmetry so that loops of gauge bosons can generate <lb/>quadratic and quartic terms in the Higgs potential. However, for a vector-like strong sector, gauge <lb/>loops contribute with the wrong sign to the β term and pushes to align—rather than misalign—the <lb/>vacuum [163, 164]. <lb/>There are, however, alternate mechanisms to enact electroweak symmetry breaking for a com-<lb/>posite Higgs. For example, <lb/> • mixing the composite Higgs with an elementary state [147], <lb/> • making use of an explicitly broken global symmetry [165] <lb/> • enlarging the H  gage  so that it cannot be completely embedded into H  global  [166–168]. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.4.6 Parameterization of phenomenology <lb/> We see that the composite Higgs can be probed through its deviations from the sm Higgs couplings. <lb/>A phenomenological parameterization of the space of light, composite Higgs models is presented <lb/>in [169] as the &apos;strongly interacting light Higgs&apos; (silh, pronounced &quot; silch &quot; ) effective Lagrangian <lb/>and revised in [170]. We briefly review the main results and refer to [169, 170] for a detailed <lb/>discussion including matching to specific composite Higgs models. We now examine a convenient <lb/>parameterization of the phenomenological Lagrangian is <lb/> L  silh  =L <lb/> SM <lb/> H  + <lb/>¯ <lb/> c  H <lb/> 2v  2  ∂ <lb/> µ  (H <lb/>  †  H)∂  µ  (H <lb/>  †  H) + <lb/>¯ <lb/> c  T <lb/> 2v  2 <lb/> H <lb/>  †  ← → <lb/> D H <lb/>  2 <lb/> − <lb/> ¯ <lb/> c  6 <lb/> v  2  λ(H <lb/>  †  H) <lb/> 3 <lb/> + <lb/> ¯ <lb/> c  u <lb/> 2v  2  y  u  H <lb/>  †  H ¯ <lb/> Q  L  <lb/> Hu  R  + · · · <lb/> + <lb/> i¯ c  W  g <lb/> 2M <lb/> 2 <lb/> W <lb/> H <lb/>  †  σ <lb/> i  ← → <lb/> H <lb/> (D <lb/> ν  W  νµ  ) <lb/> i  + · · · , <lb/> (4.62) <lb/>where H <lb/>  †  ← → <lb/> D  µ  H = H <lb/>  †  D  µ  H − D  µ  H <lb/>  †  H and the · · · represent similar terms for the other fermions <lb/>and gauge bosons. The expected sizes of these coefficients are <lb/>¯ <lb/> c  H  , ¯ <lb/> c  T  , ¯ <lb/> c  6  , ¯ <lb/> c  ψ  ∼ <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> f  2 <lb/> ¯ <lb/> c  W,B  ∼ <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> W <lb/> g  2 <lb/> ρ  f  2  . <lb/> (4.63) <lb/>Here g  ρ  parameterizes the size of the non-Goldstone composite states, for example in chiral per-<lb/>turbation theory the first such state is the spin-1 ρ meson where g  ρ  is defined to be <lb/> m  ρ  = g  ρ  f. <lb/> (4.64) <lb/>In this sense g  ρ  is a ratio of mass scales, but when one includes this state in chiral perturbation <lb/>theory (using the ccwz formalism introduced in Appendix B.1), this ratio is manifestly the value <lb/>of the ρππ coupling. Following [170], the operators in (4.62) are normalized with respect to the <lb/>Higgs vev v rather than the scale f in [169]; this is why the expected values of the barred couplings <lb/>¯ <lb/> c  i  differ by factors of v/f from the couplings c  i  ∼ 1 in equation (15) of [169]. <lb/>The phenomenological Lagrangian (4.62) can be constructed systematically from the non-linear <lb/>sigma model including symmetry breaking terms which we assume are parameterized by the sm cou-<lb/>plings that break those symmetries: the Higgs quartic coupling λ (breaking the pseudo-Goldstone <lb/>Higgs shift symmetry) and the Yukawas (breaking shift and flavor symmetries). See Appendix B <lb/>of [171] for a detailed discussion in terms of na¨ ve dimensional analysis. The general strategy is to <lb/> L  silh  = <lb/> m <lb/> 4 <lb/> ρ <lb/> g  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/> L <lb/> U, <lb/>∂ <lb/>m  ρ <lb/> , <lb/> (4.65) <lb/>where U is the dimensionless linear field containing the Goldstones, analogous to (4.11) and the <lb/>partial derivative carries a factor of m <lb/> −1 <lb/> ρ  to make it dimensionless. Note that the expansion of U in <lb/>Goldstones π automatically comes with factors of f <lb/> −1  to keep each term dimensionless. In this way <lb/>the prefactor m <lb/> 4 <lb/> ρ  g <lb/> −2 <lb/> ρ  = m <lb/> 2 <lb/> ρ  f <lb/> 2  carries the dimension of the Lagrangian. Note that this is analogous <lb/>to the prefactor Λ <lb/> 2  f <lb/> 2  in na¨ ve dimensional analysis [149–151] except that we replace Λ with a <lb/>scale which exists in the effective theory, m  ρ  &lt; Λ. This inequality is equivalent to g  ρ  &lt; 4π and <lb/>parameterizes the regime in which the  NLΣM  is weakly coupled. We then take the dimensionless <lb/>function <lb/> L to be a derivative expansion analogous to (4.18); the silh interactions appear at higher <lb/>order from the term <lb/> L  silh  = <lb/> m <lb/> 4 <lb/> ρ <lb/> g  2 <lb/> ρ <lb/>  <lb/> · · · + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> π(x) <lb/>f <lb/> ← → <lb/> ∂ <lb/>m  ρ <lb/> π(x) <lb/>f <lb/>  2 <lb/> + · · · <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> (4.66) <lb/></body>

The ¯ <lb/> c  6  , ¯ <lb/> c  u  , ¯ <lb/> c  W  (and analogous terms) break <lb/>the shift symmetries of the  NLΣM  and carry explicit factors of the sm couplings that break those <lb/>symmetries: the Higgs quartic interaction, the Yukawas, or sm gauge couplings, respectively. <lb/>Electroweak precision observables <lb/> 21  set bounds on composite Higgs models [170, 177]; at 2σ: <lb/> −1.5 × 10 <lb/> −3  &lt; ¯ <lb/> c  T  &lt; 2.2 × 10 <lb/> −3 <lb/> (4.67) <lb/> −1.4 × 10 <lb/> −3  &lt; ¯ <lb/> c  W  + ¯ <lb/> c  B  &lt; 1.9 × 10 <lb/> −3  , <lb/> (4.68) <lb/>coming from thê <lb/> T and <lb/>  parameters respectively. The former condition reflects the requirement of <lb/>custodial symmetry [178] (see [179] for an introduction) which is assumed in the latter bound. The <lb/>observation of the 125 gev Higgs and the opportunity to measure its couplings offers additional <lb/>data to fit the phenomenological Lagrangian. For example, the ¯ <lb/> c  H  and c  f  (f running over the sm <lb/> fermions) are related to each other via the couplings of the Higgs to W bosons [180]. The Higgs <lb/>mass sets (at 3σ) <lb/>¯ <lb/> c  H  ≤ 0.16, <lb/>(4.69) <lb/>where this and other bounds on composite Higgs models coming from Higgs observables are re-<lb/>viewed in [181, 182] using a slightly different effective theory parameterization introduced in [155]. <lb/>In that notation, (4.69) comes from a <lb/> 2  ≥ 0.84. Further phenomenological bounds and their re-<lb/>lations to specific models can be found in [129, 169, 170, 183]. At 2σ, Higgs data constraints the <lb/>minimal composite Higgs model to satisfy [184] <lb/> v <lb/>f <lb/> 0.5. <lb/>(4.70) <lb/>The bounds on composite Higgs models coming from Higgs observables are reviewed in [181, 182] <lb/>using a slightly different effective theory parameterization introduced in [155]. Further phenomeno-<lb/>logical bounds and their relations to specific models can be found in [129, 169, 183]. <lb/> 4.5 Little Higgs: collective symmetry breaking <lb/> The general composite Higgs is a useful framework for working with the Higgs as a psuedo-<lb/>Goldstone boson. However, we&apos;ve already seen that it is not enough to avoid tuning. The source is <lb/>clear: a pure Goldstone Higgs is protected from quadratic corrections to its mass because it is pro-<lb/>tected by a shift symmetry. This very same shift symmetry prevents the required Higgs couplings <lb/>to gauge bosons, fermions, and itself. As we saw above, we had to break this shift symmetry in <lb/>order to give the Higgs these couplings. As a result of this, we reintroduce a dependence on the <lb/>cutoff, Λ = 4πf . <lb/>In the little Higgs scenario is addresses this issue by providing a mechanism to separate the <lb/>scales v and f [185–187], see [130, 131] for reviews. This separation comes from introducing new <lb/>particles which cancel the quadratic divergences at one-loop order. Unlike supersymmetry, these <lb/>partner particles carry the same spin as the Standard Model particles whose virtual contributions <lb/>are to be cancelled. Further, this cancellation only occurs for one-loop diagrams: higher loop <lb/></body>

A process is only sensitive to explicit symmetry breaking—as necessary for sm-like <lb/> Higgs couplings—if this explicit breaking is communicated at least two different sectors of the <lb/>theory. More concretely, the symmetry is only explicitly broken if multiple couplings are non-zero <lb/>in the theory. Then any diagram that encodes this explicit breaking must include insertions from <lb/>at least two different couplings. This softens the cutoff sensitivity of various operators by requiring <lb/>additional field insertions that decrease the degree of divergence of loop diagrams. This is called <lb/> collective symmetry breaking and is the heart of the little Higgs framework. <lb/> 4.5.1 Collective breaking in action <lb/> We now demonstrate the framework of a simple little Higgs model based on the &apos;anatomy&apos; in <lb/>Fig. 12, the reader may find it useful to refer to the explicit example in Section 4.5.2 below. <lb/>Instead of a simple global group G, suppose that G = G <lb/>  × G <lb/>  . Each of these factors breaks <lb/>spontaneously to subgroups H <lb/> global  and H <lb/> global  , respectively. The spontaneous symmetry breaking <lb/>pattern is thus <lb/> G = G <lb/>  × G <lb/>  → H <lb/> global  × H <lb/> global  . <lb/> (4.71) <lb/>This gives us two linear fields Σ <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  analogous to (4.36), so that there are two separate sets <lb/>of Goldstone bosons. <lb/>Now let us explicitly break G by gauging H  gauge  ⊂ G. Suppose that both H <lb/> global  and H <lb/> global <lb/> are subgroups of H  gauge  in such a way that both Σ <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  are charged under H  gauge  with nonzero <lb/>charges q <lb/>  and q <lb/>  respectively. A piece of each subgroup is gauged, as shown in Fig. 13a. H <lb/> global  × <lb/> H <lb/> global  is then explicitly broken to a smaller subgroup, for example a vectorial subgroup identified <lb/>by the gauging, H. <lb/> On the other hand, when either q <lb/>  or q <lb/>  is set to zero, only one of the global subgroups is gauged, <lb/>as shown in Fig. 13b and 13c. In either of these cases, the resulting group is still H <lb/> global  × H <lb/> global  . <lb/>In other words, one requires both q <lb/>  and q <lb/>  to explicitly break H  global  = H <lb/> global  × H <lb/> global  . <lb/>When one of the global subgroups is uncharged under the gauged subgroup, those the Goldstone <lb/>bosons pick up no mass from the gauge sector. For the other global subgroup which is charged <lb/>under the gauge group, say H <lb/> global  , there are two possibilities: <lb/></body>

Upper (blue) and lower (red) blobs represent H <lb/>  and H <lb/> in Fig. 12. The thick black line represents the gauged symmetry H  gauge  under which Σ <lb/>  has charge <lb/> q <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  has charge q <lb/>  . When either q <lb/>  or q <lb/>  vanishes, the unbroken group is H <lb/> global  × H <lb/> global  . <lb/>1. If H  gauge  ⊆ H <lb/> global  , then loops of the gauge bosons will feed into the mass of the pseudo-<lb/>Goldstone bosons. In the absence of collective symmetry breaking, this gives a contribution <lb/>that is quadratic in the cutoff. <lb/>2. If, on the other hand <lb/> 22  , G <lb/>  ⊂ H  gauge  , then the would-be Goldstone bosons from G <lb/>  → H <lb/> global <lb/> are eaten by the (G/H <lb/> global  ) ∩ H  gauge  gauge bosons. There is no quadratic sensitivity to the <lb/>cutoff. <lb/>In the second case, the Higgs mechanism removed the Λ <lb/> 2  contribution to the pseudo-Goldstone <lb/>mass, but it also got rid of the pseudo-Goldstones themselves. <lb/>This leads us to consider the case when both G <lb/>  and G <lb/>  (not just their H  global  subgroups ) are <lb/>charged under the gauged symmetry. For simplicity, suppose G <lb/>  = G <lb/>  = H  gauge  so that one gauges <lb/>the vectorial combination. In this case, both the Σ <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  fields carrying our Goldstone bosons <lb/>are charged under the gauge group. The gauge fields become massive by the Higgs mechanism, but <lb/>there are twice as many Goldstone bosons than it can eat <lb/> 23  . Indeed, the &apos;axial&apos; combination of G <lb/> and G <lb/>  furnish a set of Goldstone bosons that remain uneaten and are sensitive to explicit breaking <lb/>effects so that they are formally pseudo-Goldstones. Any contribution to the pseudo-Goldstone <lb/>mass, however, must be proportional to (gq <lb/>  )(gq <lb/>  ), where g is the gauge coupling. In other words, <lb/>it requires interactions from both Σ <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  . The resulting mass term is suppressed since this <lb/>requires factors of the Σ <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  vevs to soak up additional boson legs. We now demonstrate this <lb/>with an explicit example. <lb/> Why can&apos;t you just rotate to a different basis? Based on Fig. 13, one might wonder if we can repartition <lb/> G = G <lb/>  × G <lb/>  so that the H <lb/> global  and H <lb/> global  subgroups are always both gauged. Alternately, perhaps one can <lb/>repartition G so that only one subgroup is ever gauged. This cannot be done, even when q <lb/>  = q <lb/>  . The reason is <lb/>precisely what we pointed out above Sec. 4.3.3: the axial combination of two groups is not itself a group since <lb/>its algebra doesn&apos;t close. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.5.2 Explicit example: (SU(3) → SU(2)) <lb/> 2 <lb/> To see the how this fits together, consider the case where G <lb/>  = G <lb/>  = SU(3) and H <lb/> global  = H <lb/> global  = <lb/>SU(2). We thus have two fields which are linear representations of SU(3) and carry the Goldstone <lb/>bosons, <lb/>Σ <lb/>  = exp <lb/>  <lb/>  i <lb/>f  <lb/>  <lb/>  0  2×2  H <lb/> H <lb/>  † <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> f <lb/>  <lb/> = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> f <lb/>  <lb/> + i <lb/>  <lb/> H <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2f <lb/>  <lb/> 0 <lb/> H <lb/>  †  H <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (4.72) <lb/>and similarly for Σ <lb/>  . For simplicity let us set f <lb/>  = f <lb/>  ≡ f . The kinetic terms for the Σ fields are <lb/> L = |D  µ  Σ <lb/>  | <lb/> 2  + |D  µ  Σ <lb/>  | <lb/> 2  = · · · + (gq <lb/>  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> V <lb/> a <lb/>µ  T <lb/> a  Σ <lb/> 2  + (gq <lb/>  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> V <lb/> a <lb/>µ  T <lb/> a  Σ <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (4.73) <lb/>where T <lb/> a  = T <lb/> a  are the generators of the gauged group. To see the contribution tot he Higgs <lb/>mass, one can Wick contract the two gauge bosons in these terms—this is precisely the analog <lb/>of the &apos;cat diagram&apos; in Fig. 9. This contraction ties together the gauge boson indices so that the <lb/>resulting term goes like <lb/>[loop factor] (gq <lb/>  ) <lb/> 2  Σ <lb/>  †  T <lb/> a  T <lb/> a  Σ <lb/>  = [loop factor] <lb/>(gq <lb/>  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2 <lb/> C  2  Σ <lb/>  †  1  gauge  Σ <lb/>  , <lb/> (4.74) <lb/>and similarly for Σ <lb/>  . Here the loop factor contains the quadratic dependence on the cutoff, <lb/>[loop factor] ∼ Λ <lb/> 2  /16π <lb/> 2  , and the factor 1  gauge  is the identity matrix in the appropriate gauged <lb/>subgroup. Here we&apos;ve used T <lb/> a  T <lb/> a  = C  2  1, where C  2  is the quadratic Casimir operator of the <lb/>representation <lb/> 24  . Now let&apos;s explicitly demonstrate how collective breaking works. <lb/> • If only the SU(2)= H <lb/> global  = H <lb/> global  parts of G <lb/>  and G <lb/>  were gauged, then there would be <lb/>two separate sets of pseudo-Goldstone bosons H <lb/>  and H <lb/>  . We plug in the expansion of Σ <lb/> (4.72) into (4.74) and note that in this case, <lb/> 1  gauge  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 1 0 0 <lb/>0 1 0 <lb/>0 0 0 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (4.75) <lb/>This picks up the Goldstones in the second term on the right-hand side of (4.72) so that there <lb/>is indeed a Goldstone mass term proportional to Λ <lb/> 2  = (4πf ) <lb/> 2  for each set of Goldstones. <lb/> • On the other hand, in the case where G <lb/>  and G <lb/>  are both gauged with q <lb/>  = q <lb/>  , the matrix <lb/> 1  gauge  becomes a true identity operator, <lb/> 1  gauge  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 1 0 0 <lb/>0 1 0 <lb/>0 0 1 <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (4.76) <lb/>Now the global symmetry breaking vevs Σ <lb/>   and Σ <lb/>   break part of the gauge symmetry <lb/>and the Higgs mechanism tells us that there are gauge bosons that eat would-be Goldstones. <lb/>Indeed, the first term on the right-hand side of (4.72)—which is no longer projected out <lb/>by 1  gauge  —encodes the mass picked up by the gauge bosons. Observe, however, what has <lb/>happened to the Λ <lb/> 2  mass contribution in the previous scenario: it is now cancelled by the <lb/>cross term between the first and third terms on the right hand side of (4.72). In other words, <lb/>the terms which gave the quadratic sensitivity to the cutoff have vanished. <lb/></body>

			<body> If we were only considering a single SU(3)→SU(2) global symmetry breaking, then we would still <lb/>be out of luck since the massive gauge bosons would have eaten all of our Goldstone bosons—so <lb/>even though we got rid of the Λ <lb/> 2  sensitivity of the pseudo-Goldstone masses, we also would have <lb/>gotten rid of the pseudo-Goldstones themselves. With foresight, however, we have followed the <lb/>advice of footnote 23: we have more Goldstones than our gauge bosons can possibly eat. <lb/>A useful way to parameterize our Goldstones is to follow the convention in (4.16): <lb/>Σ <lb/>  =exp <lb/>  <lb/>  i <lb/> f <lb/>  <lb/>  0  2×2  V <lb/>V <lb/>  † <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> exp <lb/>  <lb/> i <lb/>f <lb/>  <lb/>  0  2×2  H <lb/>H <lb/>  † <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> f <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> (4.77) <lb/>Σ <lb/>  =exp <lb/>  <lb/> i <lb/>f <lb/>  <lb/>  0  2×2  V <lb/>V <lb/>  † <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> exp <lb/>  <lb/> −i <lb/> f <lb/>  <lb/>  0  2×2  H <lb/>H <lb/>  † <lb/> 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> f <lb/>  <lb/> , <lb/> (4.78) <lb/>where we&apos;ve identified the Higgs as the axial combination of global shifts, while the vector combi-<lb/>nation of Goldstones, V , is eaten by the gauge bosons to become massive. <lb/>Now the H pseudo-Goldstones only pick up mass from diagrams that involve both the (gq <lb/>  ) <lb/>and the (gq <lb/>  ) couplings. In other words, it requires a combination of the Σ <lb/>  and the Σ <lb/>  fields. The <lb/>leading order contribution comes from diagrams of the form <lb/>Σ <lb/> Σ <lb/> Σ <lb/> Σ <lb/> ∼ <lb/> g <lb/> 4 <lb/> 16π  2  log Λ <lb/> 2 <lb/> Σ <lb/>  †  Σ <lb/> 2  . <lb/> (4.79) <lb/>Since Σ <lb/>  †  Σ <lb/>  = f <lb/> 2  − 2H <lb/>  †  H + · · · , we see that the leading term in the Higgs mass is only logarithmi-<lb/>cally sensitive to Λ because it required one power each of the Σ <lb/>  and Σ <lb/>  vevs. The Higgs mass sets <lb/>the electroweak scale to be on the order of f /(4π). This is a factor of (4π) suppressed compared to <lb/>the global symmetry breaking scale f —generating the hierarchy in ξ that we wanted—and also a <lb/>further factor of (4π) from the cutoff Λ = 4πf . In this sense, collective symmetry breaking shows <lb/>us what we can buy for factors of (4π) and why those factors are important in na¨ ve dimensional <lb/>analysis. <lb/> 4.5.3 Top partners <lb/> As before, the largest contribution to the Higgs mass comes from the top quark. In the simple <lb/>scenario above, we&apos;ve extended our gauge group <lb/> 25  from SU(2)  L  to H  gauge  =SU(3) so we&apos;ll need to <lb/>also extend the usual top doublet to include a &apos;little partner,&apos; T  L <lb/> Q = <lb/> t  L <lb/> b  L <lb/> → Q = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> t  L <lb/> b  L <lb/> T  L <lb/>  <lb/> . <lb/> (4.80) <lb/>We must also include a right-handed SU(3) singlet T <lb/> R  as a partner for the t  L  , in parallel to the <lb/>usual right-handed t <lb/> R  partner of the sm t  L  . The Yukawa terms for the top quarks are, <lb/> L  top  = λ <lb/>  Σ <lb/>  †  Qt <lb/>  † <lb/> R  + λ <lb/>  Σ <lb/>  †  QT <lb/>  † <lb/> R  + h.c. <lb/>(4.81) <lb/></body>

			<body> where the fermions are written in terms of Weyl spinors. Other terms, such as Σ <lb/>  †  QT <lb/> R <lb/> †  or Σ <lb/>  †  Qt <lb/> R <lb/> †  , <lb/>can typically be prohibited by invoking chiral symmetries. Observe that the λ <lb/>  term is invariant <lb/>under G <lb/>  if Q is a fundamental under G <lb/>  . Similarly, the λ <lb/>  term is invariant under G <lb/>  if Q is a <lb/>fundamental under G <lb/>  . This is indeed consistent since Q is a fundamental under H  gauge  which is <lb/>the diagonal subgroup of G <lb/>  × G <lb/>  . This shows us how collective symmetry breaking is embedded in <lb/>the Yukawa sector. When only one of the λ terms is nonzero, L  top  is G <lb/>  × G <lb/>  invariant. However, <lb/>when both are turned on, the global symmetry is broken down to the diagonal subgroup. <lb/>This is collective breaking is similar to the breaking of the global U(3)  Q  × U(3)  U  × U(3)  D  flavor <lb/>symmetry to U(3) by the up-and down-type Yukawas in the Standard Model. If y  u  = 0 and <lb/> y  d  = 0, then the flavor symmetry would be enhanced to U(3) <lb/> 2  since the right-handed up-type <lb/>quarks could be rotated independently of the other fields. <lb/>We can now plug in the expansion (4.77 – 4.78) into the Yukawa terms (4.81), ignoring the V <lb/> terms since we now know those are eaten by the gauge bosons. Expanding the resulting product <lb/>gives <lb/> L  top  =iH <lb/>  †  Q(λ <lb/>  T <lb/>  † <lb/> R  − λ <lb/>  t <lb/>  † <lb/> R  ) + <lb/> f − <lb/> H <lb/>  †  H <lb/> 2f <lb/> T  L <lb/> λ <lb/>  t <lb/>  † <lb/> R  + λ <lb/>  T <lb/>  † <lb/> R <lb/> . <lb/> (4.82) <lb/>From this we can write out the right-handed top eigenstates <lb/> T  R  = <lb/> λ <lb/>  t <lb/> R  + λ <lb/>  T <lb/> R <lb/> √ <lb/> λ  2  + λ  2 <lb/> t  R  = i <lb/>λ <lb/>  T <lb/> R  − λ <lb/>  T <lb/> R <lb/> √ <lb/> λ  2  + λ  2 <lb/> (4.83) <lb/>and the resulting top Yukawa, &apos;little top&apos; mass, and &apos;little top&apos; coupling to H <lb/>  †  H, <lb/> L  top  = λ  t  H <lb/>  †  Qt <lb/>  † <lb/> R  + λ  t  f T  L  T <lb/>  † <lb/> R  − <lb/> λ  t <lb/> 2f <lb/> H <lb/>  †  HT  L  T <lb/>  † <lb/> R  , <lb/> (4.84) <lb/>where we see that all of the couplings are simply related to sm top Yukawa, λ  t  = <lb/> √ <lb/> λ  2  + λ  2  . <lb/>These relations ensure the cancellation between diagrams that give a Λ <lb/> 2  contribution to the Higgs <lb/>mass, <lb/> t <lb/>λ  t <lb/> λ  t <lb/> h <lb/>h + <lb/> T <lb/>λ  t  f <lb/> −λ  t  /f <lb/>h <lb/>h <lb/> = O(log Λ). <lb/>(4.85) <lb/>Note the symmetry factor of 1/2 in the h <lb/> 2  T  L  T <lb/>  † <lb/> R  Feynman rule. For simplicity we also drop an <lb/>overall <lb/> √ <lb/> 2 in the normalization of the h field which is irrelevant for the Λ <lb/> 2  cancellation. We <lb/>see that indeed collective symmetry breaking can protect against the reintroduction of quadratic <lb/>sensitivity to the cutoff by the Yukawa interactions. <lb/>Just as in the case of natural susy, the main signature of this class of models is to look for the <lb/>&apos;little top&apos; particles which are responsible for the softening of the cutoff dependence of Higgs mass <lb/>from the top sector. One can search for these objects at the lhc through either pair production, <lb/> q ¯ <lb/> q/gg → T ¯ <lb/> T , <lb/> (4.86) <lb/>or through single production in association with a sm quark, <lb/> bq → T q <lb/> qq <lb/>  → T b. <lb/> (4.87) <lb/></body>

			<body> The little top decays approximately 50% of the time to bW , with the remaining decay products <lb/>split evenly between tZ and th. The lower bound on the little top mass from T → bW searches is <lb/> 460 GeV, which requires only a 20% tuning in the parameters. <lb/>One can continue to calculate the Coleman-Weinberg potential in the little Higgs scenario to <lb/>check for electroweak symmetry breaking and further study the phenomenology of these models. <lb/>We refer the reader to the excellent reviews [130, 131] for a pedagogical introduction. <lb/> 4.5.4 Deconstruction and moose models <lb/> We now briefly mention some connections with extra dimensional models and introduce a diagram-<lb/>matical language that is sometimes used to describe the symmetry breaking pattern in composite <lb/>models. <lb/>In Section 3.9 we introduced the holographic principle as a connection between strongly coupled <lb/>4D theories and weakly coupled theories on a curved spacetime with an extra spatial dimension. <lb/>This turns out to be a natural tool to get a handle for some of the strong dynamics encoded into <lb/>the form factors. Indeed, the minimal composite Higgs model described above was developed using <lb/>these insights [153]. <lb/>There is, however, another way to connect 5D models to 4D models. 5D models have dimen-<lb/>sionful couplings and are manifestly non-renormalizable. One proposal for a uv completion is to <lb/>discretize (&apos;latticize&apos;) the extra dimension [187–189]. In this picture, the extra dimension is split <lb/>into N discrete sites which should no longer be thought of as discrete spacetimes, but rather as <lb/>nodes in a &apos;theory space&apos; that describe a gauge symmetry structure on a single 4D spacetime. The <lb/>bulk gauge symmetry G latticized into a 4D gauged G on each of the N nodes, <lb/> G <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/> At this level the nodes are just N separate gauge groups; this is, after all, precisely what we mean <lb/>by a local symmetry. We next introduce a set of (N − 1) scalar link fields Φ  i  which are in the <lb/>bifundamental representation with respect to the N <lb/> th  and (N + 1) <lb/> th  gauge groups: (N  i  , ¯ <lb/> N  i+1  ). We <lb/>may draw these link fields as lines between the nodes, <lb/> G <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/>G <lb/> Φ  1 <lb/> Φ  2 <lb/> Φ  3 <lb/> Φ  N −1 <lb/> The arrow on the link field keeps track of the representation with respect to a group: <lb/> • Arrows leaving a node are fundamental with respect to that group. <lb/> • Arrows entering a node are anti-fundamental with respect to that group. <lb/>Now suppose each of these link fields acquires a vev proportional to 1 in their respective G  i  × G  i+1 <lb/> internal spaces. Each link field would spontaneously break the symmetry G  i  × G  i+1  → G  diag  . The <lb/>symmetries are broken down to G. One can diagonalize the mass matrix for the gauge boson—a <lb/>problem that is mathematically identical to solving the waves in a system of N − 1 springs in <lb/>series [190]—to find that the spectrum looks like a tower of Kaluza-Klein modes. In fact, the link <lb/>fields can be identified with the kk modes of the fifth component of the bulk gauge field A  5  . This <lb/>construction also shows explicitly that the Kaluza-Klein gauge fields in 5D acquire their masses <lb/>from eating the kk modes of the A  5  , which are here manifestly would-be Goldstone bosons.

			<body> coupling matter appropriately, one constructs a uv complete 4D model of a product of gauge <lb/>groups that gives the same &apos;low&apos; energy physics as an extra dimension. We refer the reader to the <lb/>original literature for details [187–189] or [73] for a brief summary. <lb/>Rather than just way to uv complete extra dimensions, deconstructions are also a useful tool <lb/>for motivating models of chiral symmetry breaking. In fact, they are a manifestation of a more <lb/>general tool for composite models called moose diagrams <lb/> 26  , see [192, 193] for details. One can <lb/>use these diagrams language to construct little Higgs models. The topology of these diagrams <lb/>encodes information about spectrum of Goldstone modes [194]. In dimensional deconstruction of <lb/>an extra dimension, it&apos;s clear that all of the Goldstones are eaten by the kk modes of gauge bosons. <lb/>More general connections between nodes, however, allow more Goldstones to survive hungry gauge <lb/>bosons. <lb/>As an example, we present the &apos;minimal moose&apos; little Higgs model from [195]. The basic <lb/>building block is the coset for chiral symmetry breaking, SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  /SU(3)  V  . We gauge the <lb/>electroweak subgroup G  EW  of SU(3)  L  and the entire SU(3)  R  , which we represent schematically <lb/>with shaded blobs: <lb/> G  EW <lb/> SU(3)  L <lb/> SU(3)  R <lb/> SU(3)  R <lb/> Σ <lb/>The minimal moose model actually requires four copies of this basic structure. As before, we only <lb/>gauge the vectorial G  EW  of each of the SU(3)  L  factors and similarly for the SU(3)  R  factors. In <lb/>other words, the theory only has two gauge couplings. This is shown schematically in Fig. 14. We <lb/>note that typically one only draws nodes for the gauge groups so that the usual moose diagram <lb/>for this model is: <lb/> G  EW <lb/> SU(3)  R <lb/> See  §4.1 of [131] for a review of this particular model. A full discussion of these moose-based <lb/>little Higgs models is outside of the scope of these lectures. In addition to the reviews mentioned <lb/>above [130, 131], see [196] for the self-described &apos;bestest&apos; little Higgs model and [197, 198] for a <lb/>discussion of the status of composite Higgs models after the first run of the lhc. <lb/> 5 Closing Thoughts <lb/> We briefly review some of the salient ideas in these lectures, acknowledge topics omitted, and point <lb/>to directions of further study. One of the themes in the latter part of these lectures were weakly <lb/>coupled descriptions of strong dynamics and we close by highlighting this common thread. <lb/></body>

We explicitly show that only the &apos;diagonal&apos; subgroups are gauged. <lb/> 5.1 Nonlinear realizations <lb/> The simplest handle on strong dynamics is to work in an effective theory of pseudo-Goldstone <lb/>bosons given by the pattern of global symmetry breaking in the strong sector. In composite Higgs <lb/>models, one addresses the Hierarchy problem by assuming that the Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone <lb/>boson associated with the dynamics of a strongly coupled sector that break global symmetries at <lb/>a scale f . We saw that generically the sm interactions required for a Higgs boson seek to push its <lb/>mass back up towards the compositeness scale, Λ ∼ 4πf . One way to push the Higgs mass back <lb/>down is to invoke collective symmetry breaking in little Higgs constructions, which can often be <lb/>described succinctly using &apos;moose&apos; diagrams. <lb/> 5.2 Holographic and deconstructed extra dimensions <lb/> Alternately, we saw that the holographic principle is an alternate way to describe the dynamics of <lb/>a strongly coupled sector through a using a higher dimensional theory with a non-trivial geometry. <lb/>From the extra dimensional perspective, the Higgs mass is natural because it is localized towards <lb/>the ir brane where the Planck scale is warped down to tev scale. Holographically, this is inter-<lb/>preted as the Higgs being a composite state. Indeed, the minimal composite Higgs model [153] <lb/>was constructed using holography as a guiding principle. <lb/>It was in some sense a coincidental footnote that the moose constructions for little Higgs models <lb/>were originally motivated by the deconstruction of an extra dimension. This picture allowed us <lb/>to clearly see that the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken global symmetries can be <lb/>identified with the scalar component of a 5D gauge field. In the deconstruction, the gauge bosons <lb/>from each copy of the gauge group eat these Goldstone modes to become the spectrum of heavy <lb/> kk modes. In this sense, little Higgs constructions are similar to gauge-Higgs unification scenarios <lb/></body>

One <lb/>way to interpret the lightness of the Higgs mass is from a non-locality in the deconstructed extra <lb/>dimension. <lb/>Deconstruction itself, however, is rooted in the idea of a hidden local symmetry in nonlinear <lb/>models. See [127] for a comprehensive review. A 5D version of the little Higgs in ads was presented <lb/>in [200]. Shortly after, [201] connected the holographic composite Higgs to a little Higgs theory, <lb/>relating the ccwz formalism of Appendix B.1 to the hidden local symmetry construction. <lb/> 5.3 Natural SUSY and partial compositeness <lb/> We began these lectures with what appeared to be a completely different subject: supersymmetry. <lb/>We saw that the natural setting for susy is superspace, which is superficially an &apos;extra quantum <lb/>dimension&apos; that is both Grassmannian and spinorial. One way to see how susy solves the Hierarchy <lb/>problem is to observe that it requires the existence of superpartners (differing by half integer spin) <lb/>that cancel the loop contributions of particles to superpotential parameters such as the Higgs mass. <lb/>We saw a similar cancellation with little Higgs theories with the notable difference that the &apos;little <lb/>partner&apos; particles had the same spin as their sm counterparts. <lb/> susy, however, must be broken. These effects feed into the large parameter space of the <lb/>minimal supersymmetric Standard Model and are required (in the mssm) for electroweak symmetry <lb/>breaking. The lhc puts tight bounds on the simplest mssm spectra and leads us to consider ways to <lb/>hide susy. One of these solutions is &apos;natural susy&apos; where one only maintains the minimal spectrum <lb/>of superpartners required for the naturalness of the Higgs mass. Among the predictions of natural <lb/> susy is a light stop and heavy first and second generation quarks. This type of spectrum, however, <lb/>is automatic when supersymmetrizing the rs model with anarchic flavor <lb/> 27  . When susy is broken <lb/>on the uv brane <lb/> 28  , 5D super fields which are localized near the uv brane are more sensitive to the <lb/>splitting between the sm and superpartner masses. Invoking what we know about the anarchic <lb/>flavor 5D mass spectrum (i.e. localization of the fermion profiles), we come to the conclusions in <lb/>Table 2. Holographically this is interpreted as supersymmetry being an accidental symmetry in the <lb/> ir. That is, the strong sector flows to a fixed point that is supersymmetric, even though the theory <lb/>at the uv is not manifestly supersymmetric. As a particle becomes more composite, it becomes <lb/>more degenerate in mass with its superpartner. A schematic moose diagram is shown in Fig. 15; <lb/>note that one of the sacrifices of this realization of natural susy is conventional unification, see <lb/>e.g. [205]. <lb/></body>

Superfields localized near the uv brane have a large overlap with susy breaking so that the <lb/>&apos;superpartner&apos; component of the superfield picks up a large mass. Thus light sm fermions have <lb/>heavy superpartners and vice versa. <lb/> 5.4 Geometrization <lb/> As a parenthetical remark, let us note the role that geometry has played in our explorations—in <lb/>fact, we can see that the notion of a novel covariant derivative came up in each lecture. <lb/>The most explicit manifestation is in the warped extra dimension scenario where we explicitly <lb/>work with a warped metric. This requires us to work more carefully with geometric structures <lb/>such as the spin covariant derivative for fermions on a gravitational background. The bulk profiles <lb/>of the various spin zero modes—which are crucial for our picture of flavor—were consequences of <lb/>different powers of (R/z) appearing in covariant derivatives and metric contractions. The heart of <lb/>the holographic principle is also essentially geometric: the isometries of ads match the conformal <lb/>symmetries of the strongly coupled theory near a fixed point. The system is so constrained by <lb/>these symmetries that the behavior of 5D fields could be identified with the renormalization group <lb/>flow of 4D operators. <lb/>Even in supersymmetry we generalized our notion of spacetime to superspace and had to <lb/>introduce a non-trivial susy covariant derivative. This is somewhat curious since we worked with <lb/>rigid (flat) superspace. Mathematically this covariant derivative comes from rigid superspace not <lb/>being torsion-free [206]. We saw that the practical significance of this covariant derivative was <lb/>to define chiral superfields, the irreducible representation of N = 1 susy that we use for matter <lb/>fields. <lb/>The nonlinear realizations we used for composite Higgs models also has a geometric structure <lb/>coming from the coset space. This is seen in the ccwz formalism reviewed in Appendix B.1, <lb/>where one identifies covariant derivative and gauge field for the coset space that are necessary to <lb/>construct invariant Lagrangians. <lb/> 5.5 Naturalness and top partners <lb/> The three classes of physics beyond the Standard Model that we have explored all generically pre-<lb/>dict new particles accessible at high energy colliders. For supersymmetry and extra dimensions, <lb/>these particles were a manifestation of the extended spacetime symmetry under which the sm <lb/> particles must transform. For a composite Higgs, this reflected a larger global symmetry breaking <lb/>pattern and included additional fermions that appear necessary to generate an sm-like Higgs po-<lb/>tential. At a technical level, we needed new particles to run in Higgs loops to soften the quadratic <lb/>sensitivity to the cutoff. Since the top quark has the largest coupling to the Higgs, a generic predic-<lb/>tion for naturalness are light (i.e. accessible at the lhc) states to cancel the top loop. While these <lb/>particles may have different spin, the examples we&apos;ve explored focused on the case where they have <lb/></body>

			<page>80 <lb/></page>

			<body> the same sm quantum numbers as the top. The color charge of these new particles make them <lb/>easy to produce at the lhc so that their non-observation is particular disconcerting. We remark <lb/>that one model building direction out of this puzzle is to consider models where the top partner <lb/>is not color charged. Such models have been constructed and invoke the tools introduced in these <lb/>lectures—often in combinations, such as &apos;double protected&apos; susy little Higgs models—under the <lb/>titles of &apos;twin Higgs&apos; or &apos;folded susy&apos; [35, 207–215]. <lb/> 5.6 Seiberg duality <lb/> In the little Higgs model, same-spin &apos;little partners&apos; cancelled the leading sm particle contributions <lb/>to the quadratic cutoff contributions to the Higgs mass. We saw that this was not coincidental, but <lb/>rather imposed by the structure of collective symmetry breaking. In the same way, the protection <lb/>of the Higgs mass in susy is most clearly understood from the tremendous constraints put on the <lb/>theory by supersymmetry. Among other things, these constraints imposed that the holomorphy <lb/>of the superpotential which, in turn, prevents the perturbative renormalization of any of the <lb/>superpotential terms—the Higgs mass being just one example. A derivation of this important <lb/>result is beyond the scope of these lectures, but is explored—along with further implications of <lb/> susy—in the reviews already mentioned. <lb/>Supersymmetry turns out also be a powerful constraint on the behavior of gauge theories. In <lb/>fact, they allow one to map out the entire phase structure of the supersymmetric generalization <lb/>of qcd, sqcd. This in itself is a topic of depth and elegance which is covered very well in <lb/>[4, 8–10, 31]. One key outcome of this exploration in the 1990s was the observation that two <lb/>distinct supersymmetric non-Abelian gauge theories, shown in Fig. 16, flow to the same ir fixed <lb/>point. One theory, sqcd, is a standard SU(N ) supersymmetric gauge theory with F flavors such <lb/>that <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/> N &lt; F &lt; 3N. <lb/>(5.1) <lb/>This theory is asymptotically free and confines in the ir. The other theory is an SU(F − N ) gauge <lb/>theory with F flavors and an additional color singlet &apos;meson&apos; which is a bifundamental under the <lb/>SU(F )×SU(F ) flavor symmetry. This theory has a superpotential, <lb/> W ∼ ¯ <lb/> QM Q, <lb/> (5.2) <lb/>which can be understood as a loop in the moose diagram since all indices are contracted. This <lb/>theory is ir free and is perturbative at the fixed point. <lb/>The fact that these two a priori unrelated theories flow to the same fixed point suggest a <lb/>compelling interpretation: the asymptotically free theory confines at low energies and is replaced <lb/>by the effective description of the ir free theory. This is an &apos;electromagnetic&apos; duality in the sense of <lb/>exchanging strongly and weakly coupled descriptions of the same physics, similar to the ads/cft <lb/> correspondence. <lb/>This Seiberg duality is a powerful handle on strongly coupled physics via a weakly coupled <lb/>4D dual description. One popular application was to simplify the construction of models with <lb/>dynamical susy breaking, see [10, 216] for reviews. In some sense this is completely analogous to <lb/>using chiral perturbation theory to describe low-energy qcd. However, unlike qcd, the low energy <lb/>(&apos;magnetic&apos;) theory is not composed of gauge singlets. In fact, there is an emergent SU(F − N ) <lb/>gauge symmetry that appears to have nothing to do with the original SU(N ) gauge symmetry <lb/>of the &apos;electric&apos; theory. One recent interpretation, however, is that this magnetic gauge group <lb/></body>

In this construction, the ρ meson <lb/>in qcd (the lightest spin-1 meson) is identified as the massive gauge boson of a spontaneously <lb/>broken gauge symmetry present in the nonlinear Lagrangian. <lb/>One can also relate Seiberg duality to the ads/cft correspondence through explicit string <lb/>realizations. Note that (5.1) is typically a different regime from the large N limit invoked in <lb/> ads/cft. From a purely field theoretical point of view, the ads/cft correspondence can be <lb/>understood as a duality cascade where a susy gauge theory has an renormalization trajectory <lb/>that zig-zags between a series of fixed points. This is reviewed pedagogically for a field theory <lb/>audience in [95]. <lb/> 5.7 Multiple guises of strong dynamics <lb/> In this final section we have touched on multiple ways in which we can address strong dynamics in <lb/>field theory: nonlinear realizations based on the symmetry breaking structure, holographic extra <lb/>dimensions, and Seiberg duality in susy. The lesson to take away from this overview is that <lb/>one should be flexible to think about strong dynamics in different languages. Often the intuition <lb/>from one understanding of strong dynamics can shed light on constructions based on a different <lb/>description. <lb/>One example is the use of Seiberg duality to describe a [partially-]composite electroweak sector <lb/>based on the &apos;fat Higgs&apos; model [218]. The idea is to take super-qcd with F = N + 2 flavors so <lb/>that the magnetic gauge group can be linked with SU(2)  L  . The realization of this idea in [159] <lb/>described this in terms of little-Higgs-esque moose diagrams where the magnetic gauge group is <lb/>&apos;color-flavor locked&apos; with an externally gauged SU(2)  L  . This mixes the magnetic gauge bosons with <lb/>the external gauge bosons so that the observed W and Z are partially composite. Independently, a <lb/>similar model was presented in [160] where the nature of this mixing was explained in terms of the <lb/>intuition from a warped extra dimension. In particular, one hope that one could directly identify <lb/>the magnetic SU(2) with the electroweak SU(2)  L  . This, however, is not possible since—as we <lb/>know from composite model building—at the compositeness scale the näive dimensional analysis <lb/>expectation is that the composite vector boson couples strongly: g ∼ 4π/ <lb/> √ <lb/> N . In other words, if <lb/>the electroweak gauge bosons are strongly coupled bound states, then one would expect a large <lb/>residual interaction with other strongly coupled bound states. In the rs language, a composite W <lb/></body>

			<body> and Z would have ir brane localized profiles and this would typically predict very strong couplings. <lb/>This would require a very large running to squeeze the profile on the ir brane. In the Seiberg <lb/>dual picture, this requires a very large number of flavors if one maintains that the W and Z are <lb/>purely composite but have the observed sm couplings, leading one to prefer partial compositeness <lb/>of these particles. <lb/>This general framework was later used to construct a model of natural susy in which follows <lb/>the general deconstruction/moose in Fig. 15 [219]. <lb/> 5.8 Omissions <lb/> We have necessarily been limited in scope. Even among the topics discussed, we have omitted an <lb/>exploration of susy gauge theories (leading up to Seiberg duality), variants of the &apos;realistic&apos; rs <lb/> models (as well as &apos;universal extra dimension&apos; models), the virtues of different cosets for composite <lb/>Higgs model building, and an overview of product space (moose-y) little Higgs models. Many <lb/>explicit calculations were left out and are left to the dilligent reader as exercises, and we only <lb/>made cursory nods to the phenomenology of these models. In addition to the three major topics <lb/>covered in these lectures, there are various other extensions to the Standard Model that we have <lb/>not discussed. Our preference focused on models that address the Higgs hierarchy problem, and as <lb/>such we have omitted discussions of many important topics such as grand unification, dark matter, <lb/>flavor, strong cp, cosmology (of which the cosmological constant is the most extreme fine tuning <lb/>problem), or any of the [typically limited significance] &apos;ambulance chasing&apos; experimental anomalies <lb/>from colliders/telescopes/underground experiments/etc. All of these topics—and perhaps many <lb/>others—are, in some combination, key parts of a model builder&apos;s toolbox in the lhc era. <lb/></body>

The latter choice is an <lb/>unphysical unit rescaling. <lb/>We must remember that the rs space is finite—and has branes at its endpoints—when we <lb/>solve the M N = µν Einstein equations. These equations depend on the second derivative of A(z) <lb/> and one should be concerned that this may be sensitive to the energy densities on the branes. <lb/>This is analogous to the Poisson equation in electrostatics where a second derivative picks up the <lb/> δ-function of a point charge. In general the branes carry tensions which appear as 4D cosmological <lb/>constants, Λ  ir,uv  .

While this may sound somewhat exotic, such compactifications are common in string <lb/>theory, and was the original formulation of the rs scenario. Note that y can take any value due to <lb/>the periodic identification of the circle, while the fixed points at y = 0, π demarcate the physical <lb/> rs space. <lb/>The orbifold identification forces us to modify (A.5) by replacing z → |z| to preserve the <lb/> z ↔ −z symmetry <lb/> 29  .

In this appendix we review properties <lb/>of fermions in an extra dimension and then derive the form of the fermion action in rs. <lb/> A.3.1 The fifth γ matrix <lb/> Firstly, unlike in 4D where the fundamental fermion representation is a Weyl spinor, 5D Lorentz <lb/>invariance requires that fermions appear as Dirac spinors. A simple heuristic way of seeing this is to <lb/>note that in 4D one can construct a γ <lb/> 5  ∼ γ <lb/> 0  · · · γ <lb/> 3  as a linearly independent chirality operator. In <lb/>5D, however, γ <lb/> 5  , is part of the 5D Clifford algebra and is just a normal γ matrix in the z-direction. <lb/> Note that the normalization of γ <lb/> 5  is fixed by {γ <lb/> 5  , γ <lb/> 5  } = 2η <lb/> 55  and has a factor of i compared to the <lb/>usual definition in 4D. One should immediately be concerned: if the 5D fermions are Dirac, then <lb/>how does one generate the chiral spectrum of the Standard Model matter? As we show below, this <lb/>follows from a choice of boundary conditions. An excellent reference for the properties of fermions <lb/>in arbitrary dimension is [222]. <lb/> A.3.2 Vielbeins <lb/> In order to write down the fermionic action, we first need to establish some differential geometry <lb/>so that we may write the appropriate covariant derivative for the spinor representation. We will <lb/>be necessarily brief here, but refer to [223–225] for the interested reader <lb/> 30  . <lb/>The familiar γ matrices which obey the Clifford algebra are only defined for flat spaces. That <lb/>is to say that they live on the tangent space (locally inertial frame) of our spacetime manifold. <lb/>In order to define curved-space generalizations of objects like the Dirac operator,we need a way <lb/>to convert spacetime indices M to tangent space indices a. Vielbeins, e <lb/> a <lb/>µ  (x), are the geometric <lb/>objects which do this. The completeness relations associated with vielbeins allow them to be <lb/>interpreted as a sort of &quot; square root &quot; of the metric in the sense that <lb/> g  M N  (x) = e <lb/> a <lb/>M  (x)e <lb/> b <lb/>M  (x)η  ab  , <lb/> (A.10) <lb/></div>

For our particular <lb/>purposes we need the inverse vielbein, e <lb/> M <lb/>a  (x), defined such that <lb/> e <lb/> M <lb/>a  (x)e <lb/> a <lb/>N  (x) = δ <lb/> M <lb/>N <lb/> e <lb/> M <lb/>a  (x)e <lb/> b <lb/>N  (x) = δ <lb/> b <lb/>a  . <lb/> (A.11) <lb/>Spacetime indices are raised and lowered using the spacetime metric g  M N  (x) while tangent space <lb/>indices are raised and lowered using the flat (tangent space) metric η  ab  (x). <lb/>Physically we may think of the vielbein in terms of reference frames. The equivalence principle <lb/>states that at any point one can always set up a coordinate system such that the metric is flat <lb/>(Minkowski) at that point. Thus for each point x in space there exists a family of coordinate <lb/>systems that are flat at x. For each point we may choose one such coordinate system, which we call <lb/>a frame. By general covariance one may define a map that transforms to this flat coordinate system <lb/>at each point. This is the vielbein. One can see that it is a kind of local gauge transformation, and <lb/>indeed this is the basis for treating gravity as a gauge theory built upon diffeomorphism invariance. <lb/> A.3.3 Spin covariant derivative <lb/> The covariant derivative is composed of a partial derivative term plus connection terms which <lb/>depend on the particular object being differentiated. For example, the covariant derivative on a <lb/>spacetime vector V <lb/> µ  is <lb/> D  M  V <lb/> N  = ∂  M  V <lb/> N  + Γ <lb/> N <lb/>M L  V <lb/> L  . <lb/> (A.12) <lb/>The vielbein allows us to work with objects with a tangent space index, a, instead of just spacetime <lb/>indices, µ. The γ matrices allow us to further convert tangent space indices to spinor indices. We <lb/>would then define a covariant derivative acting on the tangent space vector V <lb/> a  , <lb/> D  M  V <lb/> a  = ∂  M  V <lb/> a  + ω <lb/> a <lb/>M b  V <lb/> b  , <lb/> (A.13) <lb/>where the quantity ω <lb/> a <lb/>M b  is called the spin covariant derivative. Consistency of the two equations <lb/>implies <lb/> D  M  V <lb/> a  = e <lb/> a <lb/>N  D  M  V <lb/> N  . <lb/> (A.14) <lb/>This is sufficient to determine the spin connection.

The canonical form of the fermionic action must be antisymmetric in <lb/>this derivative in order for the operator to be Hermitian and thus for the action to be real. In <lb/>flat space we are free to integrate by parts in order to write the action exclusively in terms of a <lb/>right-acting Dirac operator. Hermiticity is defined with respect to an inner product. The inner <lb/>product in this case is given by <lb/> Ψ  1  |OΨ  2  = <lb/> d <lb/> 5  x <lb/> √ <lb/> g Ψ  1  OΨ  2  . <lb/> (A.21) <lb/>A manifestly Hermitian operator is O  H  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> O + O <lb/>  † <lb/> , where we recall that <lb/> Ψ  1  |O <lb/>  †  Ψ  2  = OΨ  1  |Ψ  2  = <lb/> d <lb/> 5  x <lb/> √ g OΨ  1  Ψ  2  . <lb/> (A.22) <lb/>The definition of an inner product on the phase space of a quantum field theory can be nontrivial <lb/>on curved spacetimes. However, since our spacetime is not warped in the time direction there is <lb/>no ambiguity in picking a canonical Cauchy surface to quantize our fields and we may follow the <lb/>usual procedure of Minkowski space quantization with the usual Minkowski spinor inner product. <lb/>As a sanity-check, consider the case of the partial derivative operator ∂  µ  on flat space time. <lb/>The Hermitian conjugate of the operator is the left-acting derivative, <lb/> ← − <lb/> ∂  µ  , by which we really mean <lb/> d <lb/> d  x Ψ  1  ∂ <lb/>  †  Ψ  2  = Ψ  1  |∂ <lb/>  † <lb/> µ  Ψ  2  = ∂  µ  Ψ  1  |Ψ  2  = <lb/> d <lb/> d  x ∂  µ  Ψ  1  Ψ  2  = <lb/> d <lb/> d  x Ψ  1 <lb/> ← − <lb/> ∂  µ  Ψ  2  = <lb/> d <lb/> d  x Ψ  1  (−∂  µ  ) Ψ  2  . <lb/> In the last step we&apos;ve integrated by parts and dropped the boundary term. We see that the <lb/>Hermitian conjugate of the partial derivative is negative itself. Thus the partial derivative is not <lb/>a Hermitian operator. This is why the momentum operator is given by <lb/>  µ  = i∂  µ  , since the above <lb/>analysis then yields <lb/>  † <lb/> µ  = ˆ <lb/> P  µ  , where we again drop the boundary term and recall that the i flips <lb/>sign under the bar. <lb/>Now we can be explicit in what we mean by the left-acting derivative in (A.19).

			<div type="annex"> A.3.6 Chiral boundary conditions <lb/> The vector-like (Dirac) nature of 5D spinors is an immediate problem for model-building since the <lb/>Standard Model is manifestly chiral and there appears to be no way to write down a chiral fermion <lb/>without immediately introducing a partner fermion of opposite chirality and the same couplings. <lb/>To get around this problem, we can require that only the zero modes of the 5D fermions—those <lb/>which are identified with Standard Model states—to be chiral. We show that one chirality of zero <lb/>modes can indeed be projected out, while the heavier Kaluza-Klein excitations are vector-like but <lb/>massive. <lb/>We can project out the zero modes of the wrong-chirality components of a bulk Dirac 5D fermion <lb/>by imposing chiral boundary conditions that these states vanish on the branes. Since zero modes <lb/>have trivial profiles, these boundary conditions force the mode to be identically zero everywhere. <lb/>For left-chiral boundary conditions, ψ = 0 on the branes, while for right-chiral boundary conditions <lb/> χ = 0 on the branes. Thus we are guaranteed that both terms in (A.38) vanish at z = R, R <lb/>  for <lb/>either chirality. <lb/>Imposing these chiral boundary conditions is equivalent to the statement that the compactified <lb/>extra dimension is an orbifold. This treatment of boundary conditions for interval compact spaces <lb/>was first discussed from this viewpoint in [120]. <lb/> A.4 Gauge fields in RS <lb/> We now move on to the case of bulk gauge fields. We follow the approach of [228], though we <lb/>adapt it to follow the same type of derivation espoused above for the fermion propagator. The <lb/>bulk action is <lb/> S  5  = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  xdz <lb/> √ g <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F  M N  F <lb/> M N  + (brane) + (gauge fixing) <lb/> (A.41) <lb/>To derive the propagator, we would like to write the kinetic term in the form A  M  O <lb/> M N  A  N  so <lb/>that we may invert the quadratic differential operator O <lb/> M N  . This require judicious integration by <lb/>parts including the (R/z) factors from the metric and the measure, <lb/> √ g. The relevant integration <lb/>is <lb/> R <lb/> 4z <lb/> F <lb/> M N  F  M N  = − <lb/> R <lb/> 2 <lb/> A <lb/> N  ∂ <lb/> M <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>∂  M <lb/> A  N  + <lb/> R <lb/> 2 <lb/> A <lb/> N  ∂ <lb/> M <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>∂  N <lb/> A  N  + <lb/> R <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∂ <lb/> M <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>A <lb/> N  ∂  [M  A  N ] <lb/> , (A.42) <lb/>where the last term integrates to a boundary term. Observe that this boundary term vanishes <lb/>for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions so that it vanishes for µ → ν and 5th <lb/>component scalar propagators. It does not vanish, however, for the case of vector–scalar mixing. <lb/>For simplicity, we will drop the term here in anticipation that it will be removed by gauge fixing. <lb/>With this caveat, the above integration becomes <lb/> R <lb/> 4z <lb/> F <lb/> M N  F  M N  = A  µ <lb/> R <lb/> 2z <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  η <lb/> µν  − <lb/> R <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∂  z <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>∂  z <lb/> η <lb/> µν  − <lb/> R <lb/> 2z <lb/> ∂ <lb/> µ  ∂ <lb/> ν <lb/> A  ν  + A  5 <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/>∂  z  ∂ <lb/> µ  A  µ  − A  5 <lb/> R <lb/> 2z <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  A  5  . <lb/> (A.43) <lb/>This is now in the desired form: we can read off the quadratic differential operators which encode <lb/>the propagation of the 5D gauge bosons. Observe that we have a term that connects the 4D vector <lb/> A  µ  to the 4D scalar A  5  . In our mixed position-momentum space formalism, we prefer to leave <lb/>these as separate fields. This term is removed by a judicious choice of gauge fixing. <lb/></div>

			<page>90 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex"> We must now gauge fix to remove the gauge redundancy which otherwise appears as unphysical <lb/>states in the propagator. Ideally we would like to pick a gauge where the scalar vanishes A  5  = 0 <lb/>and the vector has a convenient gauge, say, Lorenz gauge ∂  µ  A <lb/> µ  = 0. Unfortunately, these gauges <lb/>are incompatible. Intuitively this is because we only have a single gauge fixing functional to work <lb/>with in the path integral so that we are allowed to set at most one expression to vanish. Instead, <lb/>motivated by the potential for vector–scalar mixing from the boundary term of (A.43), we choose <lb/>a gauge fixing functional which cancels this mixing term, <lb/> L  gauge fix  = − <lb/> R <lb/>z <lb/> 1 <lb/>2ξ <lb/> ∂  µ  A <lb/> µ  − ξz∂  z <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>A  5 <lb/>  2 <lb/> (A.44) <lb/>We have introduced a gauge fixing parameter ξ which will play the role of the ordinary R  ξ  gauge <lb/>fixing parameter in 4D.

Summing this <lb/>together with the gauge kinetic term gives a clean separation for the kinetic terms for the gauge <lb/>vector and scalar: <lb/> L  gauge  + L  gauge fix  = A  µ <lb/> R <lb/> 2z <lb/> ∂ <lb/> 2  η <lb/> µν  − <lb/> R <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∂  z <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>∂  z <lb/> η <lb/> µν  − <lb/> 1 − <lb/> 1 <lb/> ξ <lb/> R <lb/> 2z <lb/> ∂ <lb/> µ  ∂ <lb/> ν <lb/> A  ν <lb/> + A  5 <lb/> R <lb/> 2z <lb/> −∂ <lb/> 2  + ξ <lb/> 1 <lb/> z  2  − <lb/> 1 <lb/> z <lb/>∂  z  + ∂ <lb/> 2 <lb/> z <lb/> A  5 <lb/> (A.46) <lb/> ≡ A  µ  O <lb/> µν  A  ν  + A  5  O  5  A  5  . <lb/> (A.47) <lb/>As above, now that we have the action written in terms of right-acting operators on the gauge <lb/>fields, we may proceed to do a kk reduction to determine the kk mode properties, A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  (x, z) = <lb/> A <lb/> (n) <lb/> µ  (x)h <lb/> (n)  (z). <lb/>The general solution for the n <lb/> th  kk mode profile of a bulk gauge field is <lb/> h <lb/> (n)  = aJ  1  (M <lb/> (n)  z) + bY  1  (M <lb/> (n)  z), <lb/> (A.48) <lb/>where J  α  and Y  α  are Bessel functions. A sm gauge field must have a zero mode (which is identified <lb/>with the sm state) so that it must have Neumann boundary conditions (bc). Using the formulae <lb/>for derivatives of Bessel functions, we find <lb/> Y  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R)J  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R <lb/>  ) = J  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R)Y  0  ( <lb/> (n)  R <lb/>  ), <lb/>(A.49) <lb/>where M <lb/> (n)  is the mass of the n <lb/> th  kk mode. We know that M <lb/> (n)  ∼ n/R <lb/>  and that R  R <lb/>  . <lb/>Thus M <lb/> (n)  R ≈ 0 for reasonable n. Now invoke two important properties of the J  0  and Y  0  Bessel <lb/>functions: <lb/> 1. J  0  (0) = 1 and J  0  (x &gt; 0) is under control, i.e. |J  0  (x)| &lt; 1. <lb/>2. Y  0  (0) = −∞ and Y  0  (x &gt; y  1  ) is similarly under control, where y  1  is the first zero of Y  0  (x). <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex"> From this we see that the left-hand side of (A.49) is very large and negative due to the Y  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R) <lb/> term while the right-hand side is a product of &apos;under control&apos; terms that are O(1) or less. This <lb/>implies that J  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R <lb/>  ) ≈ 0. In other words, the kk masses are given by the zeros of J  0  . The <lb/>first zero is x  1  = 2.405 so that the first kk gauge boson excitation has mass M <lb/> (n)  ≈ 2.4/R <lb/>  . The <lb/>solution for the the n <lb/> th  kk mode profile of a sm gauge field is thus [229] <lb/> h <lb/> (n)  (z) = N z <lb/> Y  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R)J  1  (M <lb/> (n)  z) − J  0  (M <lb/> (n)  R)Y  1  (M <lb/> (n)  z) <lb/> . <lb/> (A.50) <lb/>The normalization is fixed by performing the dz integral and requiring canonical normalization of <lb/>the zero mode 4D kinetic term, <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x dz <lb/> √ <lb/> gF  M N  F  P Q  g <lb/> M P  g <lb/> N Q  = <lb/> d <lb/> 4  x dz <lb/>R <lb/>z <lb/>F <lb/> (0)  (x)  µν  F <lb/> (0)  (x) <lb/> µν <lb/> h <lb/> (0)  (z) <lb/>  2  + · · · . <lb/> (A.51) <lb/>This gives N <lb/> −1/2  = R log R <lb/>  /R. <lb/> Finally, we note that for the W and Z bosons, the Higgs vev on the ir brane changes the <lb/>boundary conditions so that the zero mode profile is not flat. Heuristically it introduces a kink on <lb/>the profile near the ir brane. Since M  Z  M <lb/> (1)  , we may treat this as a perturbation to M <lb/> (0)  = 0 <lb/>so that the Z boson profile is <lb/> h <lb/> (0) <lb/> Z  (z) = <lb/>1 <lb/> R log R   /R <lb/> 1 − <lb/> M <lb/> 2 <lb/> Z <lb/> 4 <lb/> z <lb/> 2  − 2z <lb/> 2  log <lb/> z <lb/>R <lb/> , <lb/> (A.52) <lb/>and similarly for the W . <lb/> A.5 Caution with finite loops <lb/> One should be careful when calculating loop diagrams in theories with extra dimensions. When <lb/>one calculates a finite loop, say a dipole operator, na¨ ve application of effective field theory suggests <lb/>taking only the lowest kk mode and letting the 4D loop momentum go to k → ∞. This, however, <lb/>can lead to erroneous results since the loop integral runs over all momenta, including those in the <lb/>fifth dimension. Only integrating over the 4D directions removes terms that scale like k <lb/> 2  /M <lb/> 2 <lb/> kk <lb/> which would otherwise make an O(1) finite contribution. This can appear as a dependence on the <lb/>order in which one does the 4D loop integral versus kk sum; this discrepancy has appeared in <lb/>the rs gg → h production calculations [230]. One way to avoid this problem is to work in mixed <lb/>position-momentum space [228]. This was used to calculate rs constraints from f → f <lb/>  γ [231,232] <lb/>and the muon magnetic moment in [233]. These references include Feynman rules for performing <lb/>mixed space calculations. <lb/> B Appendix: Compositeness <lb/> B.1 The CCWZ Construction <lb/> The general theory of Goldstone bosons is described in the papers by Callan, Coleman, Wess, and <lb/>Zumino (ccwz) [121, 122]. In this appendix we present relevant aspects for generalizations to the <lb/>composite Higgs models of interest, while making connections to the chiral Lagrangian above as <lb/>an explicit example of their abstract procedure. See  §19.5 – 19.7 of [123] for a more pedagogical <lb/>and explicit discussion, the relevant sections of [127], or [124, 234] for more depth on how this <lb/>procedure is applied to the chiral Lagrangian. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex"> Suppose a global symmetry group G is broken to a subgroup H ⊂ G. This implies the existence <lb/>of dim G − dim H Goldstone bosons that take values on a vacuum manifold G/H. In the pion <lb/>example, G = SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  and H = SU(3)  V  . For the &apos;Mexican hat&apos; potential in Fig. 8, the <lb/>vacuum manifold is the U(1) = S <lb/> 1  since the potential spontaneously beaks U(1) to nothing. <lb/> G/H (&apos;G mod H&apos;) is a coset space. In particular, in the left coset space G/H one defines an <lb/>equivalence class of elements g ∈ G modulo elements h ∈ H, <lb/>g ∼ gh. <lb/> (B.1) <lb/>In other words, any element in g is equivalent to another element g <lb/>  if there exists an h such that <lb/> g <lb/>  = gh. Note that G/H is only a group if H is a normal subgroup of G. For our purposes, <lb/>however, whether or not G/H is a group is irrelevant. <lb/>Connecting this to physics, G/H parameterizes the vacuum manifold. Consider the simpler <lb/>case of translation symmetry. Given a spacetime point x  0  , we may map out Minkowski space by <lb/>acting on x  0  by translations in space and time; x  0  is the origin of the resulting coordinate system. <lb/>Instead of just translations, we may act on x  0  by the full Poincaré group, but we would have to <lb/>mod out by elements of the Lorentz group since those act trivially on the origin. In the same way, <lb/>given a vev U  0  , we may map out the entire vacuum manifold by acting on it with elements of G. <lb/> We note, however that the elements h ∈ H ⊂ G leave U  0  invariant so that we must to mod out by <lb/> H. The full vacuum manifold is identified with G/H. <lb/> Observe that for any g ∈ G, the distinct elements gh  1  , gh  2  , gh  3  , . . . ∈ G are all identified with <lb/>the same element of G/H, which we may evocatively write as gH. For each of these gH ∈ G/H it is <lb/>useful to pick a representative element <lb/>  ∈ G. Let us write the generator <lb/>  a  as A <lb/> a  (&apos;axial&apos;) and the <lb/>generator of h  a  as V <lb/> a  (&apos;vector&apos;). Note that the A <lb/> a  and V <lb/> a  form a complete basis of the Lie algebra. <lb/>We can thus write any element g ∈ G as a product of an element <lb/> (α) = exp(iα <lb/> a  A <lb/> a  ) ∈ G/H times <lb/>an element h(β) = exp(iβ <lb/> a  V <lb/> a  ) ∈ H: <lb/>g(α, β) = e <lb/> iα  a  A  a  e <lb/> iβ  a  V  a  = ˆ <lb/> g(α)h(β). <lb/> (B.2) <lb/>This is simply the decomposition that we did in (4.16) for chiral perturbation theory. As before, <lb/>we identify the Goldstones by promoting the broken symmetry generators to fields, α <lb/> a  → π <lb/> a  (x)/f . <lb/>For simplicity, set f = 1 for the remainder of this section; the decay constants can be restored by <lb/>dimensional analysis. Under a transformation by g ∈ G, an element of the coset space transforms <lb/>as <lb/> (π) → gˆ (π). From the decomposition of elements of G in (B.2), we may write the transformed <lb/>object as g ˆ <lb/> g(π) = ˆ <lb/> g(π <lb/>  )h(β <lb/>  ) for some π <lb/>  and β <lb/>  that depend on π and g. We thus have <lb/>ˆ <lb/> g(π) → ˆ <lb/> g (π <lb/>  ) ≡ g ˆ <lb/> g(π) h <lb/> −1  (β <lb/>  ) . <lb/> (B.3) <lb/>This gives a non-linear realization of G transformations on the Goldstone fields π(x). <lb/> We now want to write Lagrangians for the nonlinearly realized Goldstone that preserve the full <lb/>global symmetry G. For the case of chiral symmetry breaking in Section 4.3, we had a shortcut: <lb/>we constructed the field U (x) in (4.11) that transforms as a bifundamental under SU(3)  L  ×SU(3)  R  . <lb/>This is sufficient to constrain the form of SU(3)  L  × SU(3)  R  invariants en route to writing down <lb/>Lagrangian terms, (4.18). For the general case, however, we don&apos;t have this luxury, and more work <lb/>is required. <lb/>Suppose ψ(x) is a field that transforms linearly under the full group G. In the case of chiral <lb/>symmetry breaking, we could take ψ(x) to be a vector of light chiral quarks. We can identify the <lb/>Goldstone modes in ψ(x): <lb/>ψ(x) = ˆ <lb/> g (π(x)) ψ  r  (x), <lb/>(B.4) <lb/></div>

For example, for the case of SO(N )→SO(N − 1), <lb/> ψ(x) = (ψ  1  (x), · · · , ψ  N  (x)). The radial part, ψ  r  (x), can be chosen to be (r(x), 0, · · · , 0) and <lb/> (π) <lb/> are simply rotations which move r(x) into the other components of the N -vector. <lb/>Transforming (B.4) by g ∈ G gives <lb/> gψ = gˆ (π)ψ  r  = ˆ <lb/> g(π <lb/> g  )h(β <lb/> g  )ψ  r  ≡ ˆ <lb/> g(π <lb/> g  )ψ <lb/> r  , <lb/> (B.5) <lb/>where we have written π <lb/>  = π <lb/> g  and β <lb/>  = β <lb/> g  to emphasize the dependence on g.

This tells us that in order to write G invariants out of ψ  r  , one has to build H invariants. <lb/>In fact, instead of starting with ψ(x), a linear representation of G that contains heavy modes, one <lb/>could have started directly with a linear representation of H. The decomposition (B.4) is simply <lb/>a tool to convert the G linear representation ψ into an H linear representation ψ  r  . <lb/> Representations of G versus H. To clarify these ideas, first consider the case of SO(N ) → SO(N − 1). <lb/>Taking ψ(x) to be an SO(N ) fundamental and ψ  r  (x) = (r(x), 0 · · · , 0), we see that the transformation (B.6) <lb/>in this case ψ  r  is in the trivial representation of H = SO(N − 1). A slightly more non-trivial example is the <lb/>chiral Lagrangian where one may take ψ to be a vector of light chiral quarks. The analogous ψ  r  is a vector of <lb/>vectorlike quarks that transforms as a fundamental under SU(3)  V  . <lb/> Above the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking, one can suppose <lb/> 32  that the G-invariant <lb/> action is written in terms of the linear fields ψ(x). We may use the decomposition (B.4) to see how <lb/>the Goldstone bosons appear in the Lagrangian. Focusing on derivative terms (since non-derivative <lb/>terms are independent of the Goldstones), we note that <lb/> ∂  µ  ψ(x) = ˆ <lb/> g(x) <lb/> ∂  µ  + ˆ <lb/> g <lb/> −1  (x)∂  µ  ˆ <lb/> g(x) <lb/> ψ  r  (x), <lb/>(B.7) <lb/>where we&apos;ve written <lb/> (x) ≡ ˆ <lb/> g(π(x)).

Indeed, this is the reason why we could say so much about the sm in the <lb/>decades before the discovery of the Higgs: the properties of the massive electroweak gauge bosons were set by the <lb/>low energy nonlinear description, which is universal. <lb/></note>

			<div type="annex"> By differentiating the transformation rule for <lb/> , one can show that these objects transform under <lb/> g ∈ G according to <lb/> D  µ  → h  g  (x)D  µ  h <lb/> −1 <lb/> g  (x) <lb/>(B.9) <lb/> E  µ  → h  g  (x)E  µ  h <lb/> −1 <lb/> g  (x) − ih  g  (x)∂  µ  h <lb/> −1 <lb/> g  (x), <lb/>(B.10) <lb/>where h gets its x-dependence through the Goldstone field, h  g  (x) ≡ h  g  (π(x)) ∈ H. D  µ  allows us <lb/>to write the lowest-order Lagrangian term in a derivative expansion, <lb/> L = <lb/> f <lb/> 2 <lb/> 4 <lb/>Tr (D  µ  D <lb/> µ  ) . <lb/> (B.11) <lb/>What about the curious object E  µ  ? This appears to transform as the gauge field of a local sym-<lb/>metry. The locality of this symmetry is inherited from the x-dependence of the Goldstone fields <lb/> π(x) and is unsurprising since the coset identification g ∼ gh is local. E  µ  is thus a &apos;gauge potential&apos; <lb/>with respect to the unbroken symmetry H. Indeed, differentiating (B.6)—recalling that h(β <lb/> g  ) de-<lb/>pends on x through its implicit dependence on π(x)—shows that derivatives of the non-Goldstone <lb/>fields transform inhomogeneously under g ∈ G. Promoting the partial derivative to a covariant <lb/>derivative, D  µ  = ∂  µ  → ∂  µ  + iE  µ  , ensures that D  µ  ψ  r  (x) transforms homogeneously under H. <lb/> When did H become gauged? The appearance of a covariant derivative and a gauge symmetry may seem <lb/>surprising in a system where global symmetry G is was spontaneously broken to a subgroup H. The appearance <lb/>of a local symmetry, however, is not surprising since the resulting coset space G/H precisely describes a gauge <lb/>redundancy. Mathematically, the description of a &apos;gauged&apos; symmetry is identical to that of a spontaneously <lb/>broken global symmetry. For the mathematically inclined, details of the geometric structure of these theories <lb/>are presented in [235] and [236]. <lb/> The punchline is that one can construct a Goldstone boson Lagrangian which is invariant under <lb/>the full, nonlinearly realized group G, by constructing an H-invariant Lagrangian out of D  µ  . One <lb/>can further introduce non-Goldstone fields ψ  r  so long as one uses the appropriate H covariant <lb/>derivative. In this way one may include, for example, &apos;nucleon&apos; excitations to the effective theory. <lb/>The description above is based on a &apos;standard realization&apos; of the nonlinearly realized symmetry, <lb/>(B.5). One of the main results of the ccwz papers was the observation that every non-linear <lb/>realization can be brought to this standard realization [121, 122]. Physically, this means that no <lb/>matter how one imposes the G/H restriction, the S-matrix elements for the low-energy dynamics <lb/>will be identical. Explicit examples of this are presented in chapter iv of [124]. <lb/></div>
