			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> In the frameworks of High Luminosity LHC upgrade <lb/>[1] an application of additional second harmonic cavities <lb/>with the operating frequency of 800 MHz is currently <lb/>under discussion. It is desired to combine more such <lb/>cavities in a single cryostat in order to avoid multiple <lb/>transitions between cryogenic and warm areas. However, <lb/>connecting several cavities in a chain can create parasitic <lb/>higher order modes (HOM) that may affect the stability of <lb/>circulating beams and lead to excessive power loss. In <lb/>order to reduce the influence of HOM excited in the <lb/>structure by passing beams their electromagnetic <lb/>characteristics were calculated and the decay rates of the <lb/>induced wake potential in the chain of cavities with <lb/>different HOM damping devices were analyzed. In <lb/>particular, the methods of HOM damping with <lb/>rectangular and ridged waveguides attached to the beam <lb/>pipes, usage of fluted and ridged beam pipes, as well as <lb/>combinations of these methods were considered and <lb/>compared. <lb/> ARRAY OF TWO CELLS <lb/> HOM extraction from superconducting cavities could <lb/>be realised in different ways. The most common HOM <lb/>damping technique is the HOM extraction with couplers. <lb/>These devices are effective but they also have some <lb/>disadvantages. They break the cylindrical symmetry of <lb/>operating mode leading to appearance of the transverse <lb/>potential (kick-factor); they are subjects to all kinds of <lb/>pollutions and multipactor discharge [2]. Another method <lb/>implies HOM extraction to the load placed outside of a <lb/>cryogenic system. The load can be made of ferrites or in a <lb/>form of resistive material on an inner surface of the drift <lb/>tube. In this case, it is necessary to have frequencies of <lb/>these HOM higher than cut-off frequencies of drift tube in <lb/>order to provide conditions for HOM propagation toward <lb/>the load. <lb/>In [3, 4] HOM damping technique for the structure with <lb/>fluted beam pipe was considered. Such beam pipe <lb/>provides conditions for HOM propagation toward the <lb/>load. In this structure a high speed of wake field decay <lb/>was observed that is why it was decided to consider the <lb/>option of a chain of two such resonators (Fig 1a). <lb/>Figure 1: a). Array of 2 cells with fluted beam pipe; b). <lb/>Dipole wakefield; c). Transverse impedance; d). <lb/>Longidtudinal impedance. <lb/>Fig 1b shows that the wake potential falls almost to <lb/>zero at a distance comparable to the bunch separation in <lb/>LHC. The high decay rate could be achieved due to the <lb/></body>

			<body> low cut-off frequencies of H 11 and H 21 waves in the fluted <lb/>beam pipe. Nevertheless, E 01 cut off frequency is high <lb/>enough to keep operating mode trapped in cavity <lb/>preventing its dissipation in the load. <lb/>In [3, 4] the HOM damping technique for the structure <lb/>with ridged beam pipe was also considered. Such beam <lb/>pipe also provides conditions for HOM propagation <lb/>toward the load. In this structure a high speed of wake <lb/>field decay was observed so that it was decided to <lb/>conduct the same calculations (Fig 2a) as for the 2 cell <lb/>array of structure with fluted beam pipe. <lb/>Figure 2: а). Array of 2 cells with ridged beam pipe; b). <lb/>Wake potential; с). Transverse impedance; d). Longi-<lb/>tudinal impedance. <lb/>From Fig. 2b it is seen that the wake potential decays <lb/>very fast. Respectively, there also no sharp peaks <lb/>corresponding to HOM with Q ext higher than 100 on the <lb/>graph of the transverse impedance (Fig. 2с) and <lb/>longitudinal impedance (Fig. 2d) <lb/> HOM DAMPING WITH WAVEGUIDES <lb/> We can conclude that in an array of two cavities HOM <lb/>damping is not a problem. But if we want to increase the <lb/>number of cells we will face a problem of damping modes <lb/>trapped between the cells in a drift tube. So we have to <lb/>study methods to suppress these modes. HOM extraction <lb/>of the trapped modes could be obtained with waveguides <lb/>attached to the connecting drift tubes (Fig. 3a). Such a <lb/>solution with &quot; wings &quot; has proven to be effective in <lb/>extraction of fields propagating along the beam pipes [5]. <lb/>At a certain length of the connecting drift tube and the <lb/>waveguide the high rate of decay of the wake potential is <lb/>provided (Fig. 3b) and the absence of sharp peaks in the <lb/>graph of the transverse impedance is observed (Fig. 3c). <lb/>However, the longitudinal impedance exhibits several <lb/>peaks that can be potentially dangerous. These peaks <lb/>correspond to the monopole HOM. The extraction of this <lb/>HOM is complicated by the fact that the wave that they <lb/>excite in the waveguide does not propagate through, since <lb/>the cut-off frequency of this wave is much higher than the <lb/>frequency of these HOM. <lb/>Figure 3: a). Array of 2 cells with attached waveguide; b). <lb/>Wake potential; с). Transverse potential; d). Longitudinal <lb/>impedance. <lb/>In order to provide conditions for monopole modes <lb/>damping the waveguides with increased height were <lb/>attached to the structures with the ridged beam pipe (Fig. <lb/>4a). A number and amplitude of peaks on longitudinal <lb/>impedance graph decreased (Fig 4b). <lb/>Figure 4: Array of 2 cells with attached wide waveguide <lb/>and Longitudinal impedance. <lb/></body>

			<body> Unfortunately, application of such large waveguide <lb/>structures could break the cylindrical symmetry of the <lb/>operating mode; lead to an excitation of the transverse <lb/>potential and could be difficult in manufacturing. That is <lb/>why it was decided to add &quot; teeth &quot; to these waveguides <lb/>(Fig 5a) that decrease the cut-off frequency for the <lb/>monopole and other HOMs. This will allow us to <lb/>decrease sizes of the waveguides. <lb/>Figure 5: а). Array of 2 cells with ridged waveguides; b). <lb/>Wake potential; с). Transverse potential; d). Longitudinal <lb/>impedance. <lb/>In such a structure, the fast wake decay was achieved <lb/>(Fig. 5b). The absence of sharp peaks was obtained for <lb/>both the transverse (Fig. 5c) and the longitudinal (Fig. 5d) <lb/>impedance. <lb/>Figure 6: а). Array of 4 cells with waveguides; b). Wake <lb/>potential; с). Transverse impedance; d). Longitudinal <lb/>impedance. <lb/> 4 CELL ARRAY <lb/> As long as the structures shown in Fig 1a and Fig 3a <lb/>have demonstrated good results the calculations for an <lb/>array of four cells (Fig 6a) have been conducted. As <lb/>expected, the wake potential decays reasonably fast (Fig <lb/>6b) and the transverse and longitudinal impedances (Fig <lb/>6c, 6d) do not reveal strong HOMs. For the array of 6 and <lb/>8 cavities the dependences shows similar behaviour. <lb/>The same calculations have been performed for the <lb/>combination of structures shown in Fig 2a and 5a. The <lb/>obtained results are presented in Fig 7a. <lb/>Figure 7: a). Array of 4 cells with ridged waveguide; b). <lb/>Wakepotential; <lb/>c). <lb/>Transverse <lb/>impedance; <lb/>d). <lb/>Longitudinal impedance. <lb/>The results (Fig 7b-7d) are the similar to those for the <lb/>structure in Fig 5a. <lb/> CONCLUSIONS <lb/> The simulation results and the following analyses show <lb/>that all options with two cavities connected by the drift <lb/>tube have no problems with HOM damping. In turn, the <lb/>HOM damping in arrays of 4 cavities could also be <lb/>efficient with the help of waveguides. <lb/></body>
