Given that the same model has been proposed as a description of M <lb/> theory, this shows that quantum mechanics may be emergent from a theory of <lb/>gravity from which space is also emergent. <lb/> Keywords: non-local beables; matrix model; M theory; gravity <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Taking non-locality seriously <lb/> I would like to begin with a remark of John Bell on the possibility that the beables are <lb/>non-local. <lb/> &quot; Of course, we may be obliged to develop theories in which there are no strictly local <lb/>beables. That possibility will not be considered here.&quot; [1] <lb/>When I read that, I was astounded because it made me realize that ever since <lb/>encountering Bell&apos;s theorem as a first year undergraduate I have assumed that there are <lb/>non-local beables; indeed most of my work in quantum foundations has been a search for <lb/>them. The reasons to expect the beables are non-local are easy to state. <lb/> • Non-locality in quantum gravity. If the metric of space-time is a quantum operator <lb/>subject to quantum fluctuations then locality must be only a feature of the classical <lb/></body>

			<body> approximation. Non-locality must arise as a consequence of quantum fluctuations <lb/>of the metric. And these cannot be limited to the Planck scale; there are several <lb/>arguments that show that non-locality must be present in quantum gravity at large <lb/>scales. Some of these come from attempts to solve the black hole information <lb/>paradox (black hole complementarity, EPR/ERB duality), others come from the <lb/>ubiquity of defects in locality in non-perturbative treatments of quantum gravity [2]. <lb/> • Relationalism. Basic to the thinking of many of us in quantum gravity is the thesis of <lb/>relationalism, that holds that the fundamental beables describe relationships among <lb/>elementary events or particles. That is, the hidden variables do not give a more <lb/>detailed description of the inner workings of an electron, they describe details of <lb/>relations between the diverse electrons in the universe that are ignored under the <lb/>coarse graining that gives rise to the emergence of space. These can be called <lb/> relational hidden variables. <lb/> • Space is emergent. One thing the diverse approaches to quantum gravity agree with <lb/>is that space is not fundamental, but emergent. More fundamental than space is a <lb/>network of relations, which constitute the basic ontology of the theory. This more <lb/>fundamental and relational network of relations has been described as a graph (loop <lb/>quantum gravity, quantum graphity), a matrix (string theory), a partial order (causal <lb/>set theory), a dual triangulation (causal dynamical triangulations and spin foams), <lb/>but what all these have in common is the hypothesis that space is not part of the basic <lb/>ontology of the world. But if space is emergent, so is locality. This suggests that the <lb/>non-locality of quantum theory is described by beables that are ordinary beables at <lb/>the non-local (or better: a-local) level that become part of the quantum state when <lb/>space emerges. In other words, space and the quantum state emerge together, each <lb/>carrying part of the information in the fundamental non-local ontology. <lb/>This leads to a hypothesis. The fundamental beables are relational and a-local, having <lb/>their fundamental description in a phase from which space has yet to emerge. Space and <lb/>quantum theory emerge at the same time. The stochasticity of quantum theory arises from <lb/>our lacking control over beables that describe relationships between a system and other, <lb/>distant systems in the universe. <lb/> 2. A non-local hidden variables theory <lb/> Can the hypothesis just stated be expressed in a detailed dynamical theory of relational <lb/>hidden variables, from which quantum mechanics can be derived? Yes, and it has been <lb/>done several different ways [3–7]. <lb/>Here is a sketch of one way, which is described in detail in [4], from which the following <lb/>is taken. <lb/></body>

			<body> The beables of the theory are d, N × N real symmetric matrices X <lb/> j <lb/> ai  , with a = 1, ..., d <lb/> and i, j = 1, ..., N . The classical, local observables are taken to be the eigenvalues of these <lb/>matrices, λ  a <lb/>i  . These can be imagined to give the positions of N particles in d dimensional <lb/>space. Relative to these, the matrix elements are non-local, as a shift in the value of any one <lb/>matrix element perturbs all the eigenvalues. Our aim is to give a dynamics to the matrices <lb/>such that quantum dynamics emerges for their eigenvalues. <lb/>The dynamics of these matrices is given by an action 1 , <lb/> S = µ <lb/> dtT r <lb/> ˙ <lb/> X <lb/> 2 <lb/> a  − ω <lb/> 2  [X  a  , X  b  ][X <lb/> a  , X <lb/> b  ] <lb/> (1) <lb/>We choose the matrices X  a  to be dimensionless. ω is a frequency and µ has dimensions of <lb/>mass · length <lb/> 2  . We do not assume  = 1, in fact, as we aim to derive quantum mechanics <lb/>from a more fundamental theory,  is not yet meaningful. We will introduce  as a function <lb/>of the parameters of the theory when we derive the Schrödinger equation as an approximate <lb/>evolution law. We may note that the parameters of the theory define an energy  = µω  2  . <lb/>The basic idea is that the matrix elements of X  a  will be the non-local hidden variables. <lb/>The theory is invariant under SO(N ) transformations, <lb/> X <lb/> a  → U X <lb/> a  U <lb/> T <lb/> (2) <lb/>where U ∈ SO(N ). These constitute gauge transformations, so the physical observables <lb/>will be invariants under SO(N ). These include the eigenvalues of the matrices <lb/> λ <lb/> a <lb/>i <lb/> (3) <lb/>We note that the model has a translation symmetry given by <lb/> X <lb/> a  → X <lb/> a  + v <lb/> a  I. <lb/> (4) <lb/>The result is that the center of mass momentum of the system is conserved. <lb/>Now the potential energy <lb/> U = µω <lb/> 2  T r <lb/> [X  a  , X  b  ][X <lb/> a  , X <lb/> b  ] <lb/> (5) <lb/>has its minima when the d matrices commute with each other, in which case they can be <lb/>simultaneously diagonalized, <lb/> X <lb/> a  = D <lb/> a  = diag(λ <lb/> a <lb/> 1  . . . . , λ <lb/> a <lb/>N  ) <lb/> (6) <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote"> 1 <lb/> This action is found in string theory, where it is called the BF SS matrix model, it also can be understood <lb/>to arise from an SO(N ) Yang-Mills theory in an approximation from which spatial derivatives can be <lb/>neglected [8–11]. <lb/></note>

			<body> This will give the classical approximation, hence we take the eigenvalues to label the <lb/>positions of N identical particles in R  d  . At the classical level the N particles are free; <lb/>but if we wanted to model a system with classical interactions we could add to the potential <lb/>energy a function of the eigenvalues. <lb/> S <lb/>  = µ <lb/> dtT r <lb/> ˙ <lb/> X <lb/> 2 <lb/> a  − ω <lb/> 2  [X  a  , X  b  ][X <lb/> a  , X <lb/> b  ] − V (λ) <lb/> (7) <lb/>To get quantum behaviour, we will put the system at a small, but finite temperature, the <lb/>result of which will be that the matrix elements undergo Brownian motion as they oscillate <lb/>in the potential. It follows from linear algebra that the eigenvalues also undergo Brownian <lb/>motion. The work is then to show that the parameters of the theory can be scaled with N <lb/> in such a way that quantum dynamics is realized for the eigenvalues. <lb/>I won&apos;t give the details here, but they can be found in [4]. The key steps are as follows. <lb/>1. When the system is at finite temperature the eigenvalues can be shown to undergo <lb/>Brownian motion. Using the language appropriate to Brownian motion, which are <lb/>stochastic differential equations, we derive a description of this Brownian evolution. <lb/>These are defined in terms of a probability density for the eigenvalues, ρ(λ, t) and <lb/>a probability current velocity, v  a <lb/>i  (λ, t). These are related by probability current <lb/>conservation, <lb/> ˙ <lb/> ρ(λ, t) = <lb/> δρv  a <lb/>i  (λ, t) <lb/>δλ  a <lb/>i <lb/> (8) <lb/>2. One shows that to leading order in 1/N the current velocity is irrotational, so it is the <lb/>gradient of a scalar potential, S(λ, t), to leading order in 1/N , <lb/> µv <lb/> a <lb/>i  = <lb/> δS  λ  (λ) <lb/> δλ  i <lb/>a <lb/> + O(1/N ). <lb/> (9) <lb/>3. We take advantage of a fundamental insight of Nelson [12] who showed that quantum <lb/>mechanics can be understood as a form of Brownian motion with the unusual <lb/>property that it is conservative. That is, the motion is stochastic, but unlike the <lb/>normal case in which Brownian motion is accompanied by dissipation, there is an <lb/>average conserved energy. This means the stochastic evolution of the eigenvalues <lb/>becomes time reversal invariant. To achieve this we consider the diffusion of the <lb/>eigenvalues in this system. The diffusion has two sources, thermal diffusion, related <lb/>to being at a finite temperature, T , and large N effects, coming from the fact that all <lb/>matrix elements contribute a little bit to the motion of an eigenvalue. <lb/>We find conservative Brownian motion in a regime where these two effects are <lb/>balanced. As stressed in [13] some kind of tuning is necessary to derive quantum <lb/>mechanics, which is conservative and invariant under time reversal, from a general <lb/>theory of stochastic motion, in order to cancel dissipative effects. <lb/></body>

			<body> To describe this regime we study the stochastic dynamics of the eigenvalues in a <lb/>particular limit where we take the size of the matrices, N → ∞ while we take the <lb/>temperature T → 0 in a way that keeps a fixed value for the diffusion constant ν  λ <lb/> fixed. <lb/>This regime is defined by holding fixed a dimensionless scaled temperature <lb/> t = <lb/> N T <lb/> 8(d − 1)µω  2 <lb/> (10) <lb/>The diffusion constant for the eigenvalues in this limit is shown to be given by <lb/> ν  λ  = ω <lb/>dt  3/2 <lb/> 4(d − 1)  3/2 <lb/> (11) <lb/>4. We then define the wave functional <lb/> Ψ(λ, t) = <lb/> ρ(λ, t)e <lb/> ıS(λ,t)/ <lb/> (12) <lb/>where Planck&apos;s constant is defined by <lb/> = µν  λ  = µω <lb/>t  3/2  d <lb/> 4(d − 1)  3/2 <lb/> (13) <lb/>5. There is one last step which involves subtracting out a certain divergent energy E  <lb/> Q  . <lb/>We use this to renormalize the wavefunctional so that <lb/> Ψ  r  (λ) = e <lb/> iE  <lb/> Q  t/  Ψ(λ) <lb/> (14) <lb/>This we are able to show satisfies the free Schrödinger equation, <lb/> ı <lb/>dΨ  r  (λ, t) <lb/>dt <lb/> = <lb/> − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2µ <lb/> δ  2 <lb/> δ(λ  a <lb/>i  )  2 <lb/> Ψ  r  (λ, t) <lb/> (15) <lb/>6. If we added interactions V (λ) we find instead <lb/> ı <lb/>dΨ  r  (λ, t) <lb/>dt <lb/> = <lb/> − <lb/>  2 <lb/> 2µ <lb/> δ  2 <lb/> δ(λ  a <lb/>i  )  2  + V (λ) <lb/> Ψ  r  (λ, t) <lb/> (16) <lb/> 3. Implications <lb/> The model I have sketched shows that quantum mechanics can be recovered from an <lb/>explicit hidden variables model whose beables are non-local. This is in accord with the <lb/>reasons I stressed that the beables of quantum theory should be taken as non-local. I would <lb/>thus propose that the ultimate legacy of Bell&apos;s fundamental work will be the discovery that <lb/>quantum theory is a description of an a-local world, which we happen to see in a phase <lb/></body>

			<body> where space has emerged. When we try to describe the physics of local subsystems of the <lb/>universe, delineated by the emergent and approximate concept of locality, we are forced to <lb/>neglect interactions which are really there between the subsystem&apos;s microscopic degrees of <lb/>freedom and other degrees of freedom now emerged in distant parts of the universe. These <lb/>non-local interactions are mediated by relational degrees of freedom that are non-local, in <lb/>the sense that they are shared between subsystems that are distant from each other in the <lb/>emergent concept of locality. <lb/>Because of the neglect of these non-local degrees of freedom, the quantum physics of <lb/>local subsystems is stochastic and subject to a persistent and universal Brownian motion, <lb/>which is the cheshire cat smile of the fundamental a-locality of the world. In this sense <lb/> is a measure of the resistance of the world to a local description. <lb/></body>
