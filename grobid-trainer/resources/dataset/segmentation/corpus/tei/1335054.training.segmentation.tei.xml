			<front> Boundary condition for D-brane from Wilson loop <lb/>at the AdS boundary <lb/> 1 <lb/>Tsunehide Kuroki <lb/> 2 <lb/> Department of Physics, Rikkyo University, Toshima, Tokyo 171-8501 <lb/> Abstract <lb/> We study the supersymmetric Wilson loops in the four-dimensional N = 4 super <lb/>Yang-Mills theory in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the gauge <lb/>theory side, it is known that the expectation value of the Wilson loops of circular <lb/>shape with winding number k, W  k  (C), is calculable by using a Gaussian matrix model. <lb/>In the gravity side, the expectation value of the loop is conjectured to be given by <lb/>the classical value of the action SD3 for a probe D3-brane with k electric fluxes as <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = e <lb/> −S  D3  . However, according to the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, <lb/>in principle we have to perform the path integral for the D3-brane action in the <lb/>AdS5×S <lb/> 5  under appropriate boundary conditions which should be given in terms <lb/>of data of the Wilson loop at the AdS boundary. We clarify what kind of boundary <lb/>conditions are imposed on the D3-brane from the Wilson loop. As an application, our <lb/>boundary conditions provide a natural interpretation of a position of an eigenvalue <lb/>in the Gaussian matrix model as an integrated flux on the D3-brane. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> Much progress in string theory for the last ten years suggests that quantum gravity will be formulated <lb/>as the large-N limit of gauge theories or matrix models [2–4]. The key in this approach is that all the <lb/>information on gravity or geometry in the bulk is encoded into gauge theory degrees of freedom on the <lb/>boundary. This idea called holography is realized in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, we <lb/>consider a circular Wilson loop in the gauge theory in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence as a <lb/>nice and concrete realization of holography idea. In our analysis, we emphasize importance of boundary <lb/>conditions the gauge theory imposes on the geometry. We hope this kind of study has some implications <lb/>to the brane world scenario, cosmology, or other quantum gravity formulations. <lb/> 2 Circular Wilson loop in N = 4 U (N ) SYM <lb/> In this section we review the circular Wilson loop in the four-dimensional N = 4 U (N ) supersymmetric <lb/>Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in the large-N limit. Bosonic fields in this theory are the U (N ) gauge field A  µ <lb/> (µ = 0 ∼ 3), the scalar fields Φ  i  (i = 4 ∼ 9) in the adjoint representation of U (N ). In terms of these <lb/>fields, the circular Wilson loop is defined as <lb/> W  k  (C) = <lb/>1 <lb/> N <lb/> trP exp <lb/> (∫ <lb/> C <lb/> ds(iA  µ  ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  (s) + Φ  i  ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> i  (s)) <lb/> ) <lb/> , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where C is a circle parametrized by s, k is the winding number of the Wilson loop, and x <lb/> µ  (s), y <lb/> i  (s) <lb/>represents the shape of the loop in the four-dimensional, and six-dimensional space, respectively. In <lb/>particular, when we are interested in the circular Wilson loop, x <lb/> µ  (s) describes the circle C, e.g. x <lb/> µ  (s) = <lb/>(cos s, sin s, 0, 0). In order to take advantage of the AdS/CFT correspondence, eventually we have to take <lb/> N → ∞ limit. <lb/></body>

			 <body> In this setup, let us summarize the main result in the gauge theory side [5–7]. We are interested in <lb/>the vacuum expectation value of the circular Wilson loop in the large-N limit <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/> Z  gauge <lb/> ∫ <lb/> D(all fields)W  k  (C)e <lb/> −Sgauge  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where S  gauge  is the action of the gauge theory. The standard way to compute this is by the perturbation <lb/>theory in terms of the gauge theory coupling constant g  YM  . We choose two points on the Wilson loop s  1  , <lb/> s  2  , and connect fields on these points by their propagators as ⟨A  µ  (x(s  1  ))A  ν  (x(s  2  ))⟩, ⟨Φ  i  (x(s  1  ))Φ  j  (x(s  2  ))⟩. <lb/>However, since these fields also carry ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  and ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> i  , the net contribution of the propagators becomes <lb/> − ⟨A  µ  (x(s  1  ))A  ν  (x(s  2  ))⟩ ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  (s  1  ) ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> ν  (s  2  ) + ⟨Φ  i  (x(s  1  ))Φ  j  (x(s  2  ))⟩ ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> i  (s  1  ) ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> j  (s  2  ). <lb/>(3) <lb/>The crucial property of the circular Wilson loop is that this becomes constant, namely independent of <lb/>the space-time points x <lb/> µ  (s  1  ) and x <lb/> µ  (s  2  ) provided that ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 2 <lb/> − ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> 2  = 0. More precisely, when this condition is <lb/>satisfied, the above quantity becomes g <lb/> 2 <lb/>YM  /8π <lb/> 2  . Thus the combined propagator loses space-time depen-<lb/>dence. Due to this property, the computation of ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ is greatly simplified. Therefore, in the following <lb/>let us concentrate on the circular Wilson loop (1) with ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 2 <lb/> − ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> 2  = 0 satisfied. In fact, this condition is <lb/>known as the one under which the Wilson loop preserves the half of supersymmetries. Furthermore, it is <lb/>known that diagrams with internal vertices vanish because of the supersymmetry. Thus the computation <lb/>is reduced to the sum over all planar diagrams with the constant propagator, which is just a combinatorics <lb/>problem. Actually, the calculation boils down to the one-matrix model <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = <lb/> ⟨ <lb/> 1 <lb/> N <lb/> tr e <lb/> kM <lb/> ⟩ <lb/> MM <lb/> ≡ <lb/> 1 <lb/> Z  MM <lb/> ∫ <lb/> dM <lb/> 1 <lb/> N <lb/> tr e <lb/> kM  e <lb/> −SMM  , <lb/> (4) <lb/> S  MM  = <lb/>2N <lb/> λ <lb/> trM <lb/> 2  , <lb/>λ ≡ g <lb/> 2 <lb/> Y M  N, <lb/> (5) <lb/>where M is an N × N Hermitian matrix. From the observations above, it is easy to see that this matrix <lb/>model reproduces the calculation of ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ in the large-N limit, because it generates all planar diagrams <lb/>with the constant propagator proportional to λ/N = g <lb/> 2 <lb/>YM  . Note that the operator <lb/> 1 <lb/> N  tr e <lb/> kM  is a remnant <lb/>of the Wilson loop W  k  (C), where the winding number k appears in the exponent. We can calculate <lb/>(4) by the standard technique [8]: performing integration over angular variables, (4) can be written as <lb/>integration over N eigenvalues of M <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = <lb/>1 <lb/> Z <lb/> ∫ ∏ <lb/> i <lb/> dm  i  exp(−N V  eff  ), <lb/> V  eff  = <lb/> ∑ <lb/> i <lb/> 2 <lb/> λ <lb/>m <lb/> 2 <lb/> i  − <lb/> ∑ <lb/> i,j <lb/> log(m  i  − m  j  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> − <lb/> k <lb/>N <lb/>m  N  . <lb/> (6) <lb/>This implies that the system now becomes that of N particles in the Gaussian potential with strong <lb/>repulsive logarithmic force between them. Moreover, in the presence of the Wilson loop, the last eigenvalue <lb/> m  N  feels extra linear potential proportional to k. In particular, when k is of order N , it survives in the <lb/>large-N limit. This situation is quite interesting, so henceforth let us discuss the case where k is of order <lb/> N . <lb/>In the large-N limit, these eigenvalues are expected to form a continuous distribution, and the dis-<lb/>tribution function can be derived from the saddle point method in the large-N limit. The result is <lb/>[1] <lb/> ρ(m) = <lb/>2 <lb/> πλ <lb/> √ <lb/> λ − m  2  + <lb/>1 <lb/> N <lb/>δ(m − m  *  ), <lb/>(7) <lb/>which is displayed in Figure 1. Here m  *  = <lb/> √ <lb/> λ(1 + κ  2  ) and κ ≡ k <lb/> √ <lb/> λ/4N which is O(1) when k is O(N ). <lb/>The isolated eigenvalue distribution at m  *  originates from the last eigenvalue m  N  . Given (7), it is easy <lb/>to calculate ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ as [1, 9] <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = exp <lb/> [ <lb/> N <lb/> ( <lb/> 2κ <lb/> √ <lb/> 1 + κ  2  + 2arcsinh κ <lb/> )] <lb/> . <lb/> (8) <lb/></body>

			<body> −√λ <lb/>  <lb/> √λ <lb/>  <lb/> m  * <lb/> m <lb/> Figure 1: The eigenvalue distribution with k of O(N ). <lb/>Conversely, detailed analysis [1] of the matrix model tells us that on general grounds, we can deduce from <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ the position of the isolated eigenvalue as ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = exp(−V  eff  (k)) → m  *  = −V <lb/> ′ <lb/> eff  (k). In the <lb/>gravity side, by a totally different method we can calculate ⟨W  k  (C)⟩, from which we can read off a bulk <lb/>interpretation of m  *  by using this relation. <lb/> 3 AdS/CFT for Wilson loop <lb/> In this section we review main results of the Wilson loop in the AdS/CFT correspondence. First we <lb/>consider the case of the Wilson loop with winding number k = 1, then we turn to k of O(N ) case. <lb/> 3.1 k = 1 case <lb/> The statement of AdS/CFT for the Wilson loop with k = 1 is [10, 11] <lb/> ⟨W  k=1  (C)⟩ = <lb/> ∫ <lb/> b.c. <lb/> e <lb/> −(SNG+S  b  )  , <lb/> (9) <lb/>where S  NG  and S  b  is the Nambu-Goto action and a possible boundary term, respectively. In the right <lb/>hand side the path integral should be over all fields on a string world sheet in AdS  5  ×S <lb/> 5  attached to the <lb/>loop C at the AdS boundary under appropriate boundary conditions. Here we stress importance of the <lb/>boundary conditions in the right hand side in (9). First of all, from the theoretical point of view, in <lb/>the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence a bulk or gravity quantity should be completely fixed by the <lb/>boundary or gauge theory data, which should enter in the right hand side through boundary conditions. <lb/>On the other hand, from the practical point of view, usually the relation (9) is applied in the case of <lb/> λ ≫ 1, where the path integral in the right hand side can be replaced by e <lb/> −S  cl  with S  cl  the action <lb/>evaluated for the classical solution. However, in order to fix the classical solution, we have to specify <lb/>appropriate boundary conditions at, for example, the AdS boundary corresponding to the presence of <lb/>the Wilson loop. Thus an important issue in (9) is what kind of boundary conditions and/or boundary <lb/>terms the Wilson loop impose on the bulk or geometry. <lb/>A nice argument on boundary conditions based on the T-duality is given in [12]: let us start from <lb/>the 10-dimensional gauge theory, namely D9-brane world volume theory. If a string is attached to a <lb/>Wilson loop in this theory, string coordinates in all directions X <lb/> µ  (µ = 0 ∼ 9) should have the Dirichlet <lb/>boundary condition because their boundary values are all fixed by the position of the Wilson loop. Then <lb/>applying the T-duality in i = 4 ∼ 9 directions, we find that X <lb/> µ  (µ = 0 ∼ 3) still have the Dirichlet <lb/>boundary condition, while X <lb/> i  (i = 4 ∼ 9) should have the Neumann boundary condition. Namely, the <lb/>string coordinates have the Dirichlet boundary condition for the D3-brane world volume directions, and <lb/>the Neumann boundary condition for the orthogonal directions. <lb/>The above T-duality argument implies that the right hand side in (9) will be a function of X <lb/> µ <lb/> (µ = 0 ∼ 3) and P  i  (i = 4 ∼ 9). This requires boundary terms for the Neumann directions i = 4 ∼ 9. <lb/>In order to see this, let us parametrize a string world sheet attached to the Wilson loop by σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  as <lb/></body>

			<body> follows: the world sheet boundary exists at σ <lb/> 2  = 0, while the boundary itself is parametrized by σ <lb/> 1  . <lb/>Then variation of the classical world sheet action reads <lb/> δS <lb/> cl <lb/> = <lb/> ∫ <lb/> d <lb/> 2  σ <lb/> [ <lb/> δS <lb/>δX <lb/>δX + <lb/> δS <lb/>δ∂X <lb/>δ∂X <lb/> ] <lb/> cl <lb/> = − <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  P  i  δX <lb/> i  , <lb/> (10) <lb/>where |  cl  represents evaluation via a classical solution and P  i  = δL/δ∂  2  X <lb/> i  is the boundary momentum. <lb/>This equation suggests that the classical action is a function of X <lb/> i  . The standard way to flip the boundary <lb/>condition, namely to change a function of X <lb/> i  to that of P  i  is the Legendre transformation. We add the <lb/>boundary term as <lb/>˜ <lb/> S = S + <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  P  i  X <lb/> i <lb/> → δ ˜ <lb/> S <lb/> cl <lb/> = <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  X <lb/> i  δP  i  , <lb/> (11) <lb/>which shows that <lb/> cl <lb/> is a function of P  i  as expected. Thus we conclude that we have to add the boundary <lb/>term S  b  = <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  P  i  X <lb/> i  for the Neumann direction. <lb/>In order to give a concrete form of the above boundary conditions, let us choose the AdS  5  ×S <lb/> 5  metric <lb/>as <lb/> ds <lb/> 2  = <lb/> L <lb/> 2 <lb/> Y  2 <lb/> ( <lb/> (dX <lb/> µ  ) <lb/> 2  + (dY <lb/> i  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> = L <lb/> 2 <lb/> ( ( <lb/> 2πα <lb/> ′  U <lb/>L  2 <lb/> )  2 <lb/> (dX <lb/> µ  ) <lb/> 2  + <lb/>(dU <lb/> i  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> U  2 <lb/> ) <lb/> , (U <lb/> i  ) <lb/> 2  = U = <lb/> L <lb/> 2 <lb/> 2πα  ′  Y <lb/>, U <lb/> i  = U θ <lb/> i  , <lb/> (12) <lb/>where L = λ <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> √ <lb/> α  ′  , θ <lb/> i  is a coordinate of the unit S <lb/> 5  , and the gauge theory lives in the four-dimensional <lb/>space-time X <lb/> µ  (µ = 0 ∼ 3). Then the Wilson loop (1) provides following boundary conditions [12]: <lb/> • Dirichlet: X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/> • Neumann: P  i  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = ˙ <lb/> y  i  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/>where P  i  is the conjugate momentum of U <lb/> i  . The latter equation is nontrivial, but there are some <lb/>arguments supporting it based on symmetries and constraints [12]. In the next section we derive a <lb/>similar boundary condition in the case of k of O(N ). It is worth noticing that these boundary conditions <lb/>are along the spirit of AdS/CFT, namely the Wilson loop data provides the boundary conditions for the <lb/>fields in the bulk. <lb/> 3.2 k of O(N ) case <lb/> Now let us turn to the case where k is of O(N ). A crucial observation is that in this case we have to <lb/>consider k world sheets, because the Wilson loop with winding number k originates from k fundamental <lb/>open strings connecting N D3-branes and a probe D3-brane, which should correspond to k world sheets <lb/>attached to the loop in the gravity side. However, since k is now of O(N ), we are considering N ∼ 1/g  s <lb/> world sheets, which means that we can no longer neglect string interactions, namely we need nonpertur-<lb/>bative description. For this system, an interesting proposal was made in [13] that when k is of O(N ), <lb/>the string world sheet attached to the loop should be replaced by a D3-brane world volume. Namely, the <lb/>basic relation for the Wilson loop in the AdS/CFT correspondence given in (9) now becomes <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = <lb/> ∫ <lb/> b.c. <lb/> e <lb/> −(SD3+S  b  )  , <lb/> (13) <lb/>where S  D3  is the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for a D3-brane including the Wess-Zumino term. Their proposal <lb/>is based on the fact that a fundamental string can be regarded as a BPS configuration from the point of <lb/>view of the D3-brane world volume theory [14]. In fact, as we will see later, using the relation (13), we <lb/>can compute ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ in the gravity side and it agrees exactly with the gauge theory result given in (8). <lb/>In this approach, there are apparently different points from the string world sheet (k = 1) case: first <lb/>of all, the world volume is now four-dimensional and hence attachment to the one-dimensional loop at the <lb/></body>

			<body>AdS boundary is somewhat nontrivial. In the following σ <lb/> a  (a = 1 ∼ 4) denote coordinates on the world <lb/>volume. Secondly, apart from the scalar fields X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> a  ), U <lb/> i  (σ <lb/> a  ) (µ = 0 ∼ 3, i = 4 ∼ 9) which describe the <lb/>position of the D3-brane in AdS  5  ×S <lb/> 5  in terms of the coordinates given in (12), we have a U (1) gauge <lb/>field A  a  (σ <lb/> a  ). Thus we have to specify a boundary condition and a possible boundary term even for this <lb/>gauge field. A  a  (σ <lb/> a  ) on a D3-brane world volume should not be confused with the original U (N ) gauge <lb/>field in the gauge theory side. <lb/>For the purpose of examining boundary conditions for a D3-brane, let us parametrize the D3-brane <lb/>world volume in such a way that the world volume boundary is again given by σ <lb/> 2  = 0, and the one-<lb/>dimensional boundary itself is parametrized by σ <lb/> 1  . Other directions are parametrized by σ <lb/> 3  , σ <lb/> 4  . The <lb/>same argument as before yields apparent boundary conditions <lb/>1. X <lb/> µ  : Dirichlet, X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/>(Here by using reparametrization invariance of the Wilson loop, we make an identification s = σ <lb/> 1  .) <lb/>2. U <lb/> i  : Neumann, <lb/>3. Π <lb/> a=1  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −ik for each σ <lb/> 1  . <lb/>Several notices are in order. As for 2, it should be emphasized that we do not yet know explicitly how <lb/>to specify P  U  i  at the boundary. It is true that in the string case P  U  i  = ˙ <lb/> y  i  , but it is not guaranteed <lb/>that this is also the case with the D3-brane. The boundary condition 3 reflects that the fact that the <lb/>end point of a string attached to a D-brane can be regarded as an electric charge from the D3 world <lb/>volume viewpoint and therefore if it moves along the circle to form the Wilson loop, it induces flux of <lb/> U (1) gauge field in the σ <lb/> 1  direction. Recalling the discussion in (11), we have to add the boundary terms <lb/>for fields with the Neumann boundary conditions, namely the boundary term for the transverse scalar <lb/>fields <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  dσ <lb/> 3  dσ <lb/> 4  P  U  i  U <lb/> i  and that for the gauge field <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  dσ <lb/> 3  dσ <lb/> 4  Π <lb/> 1  A  1  . <lb/>Now we make a short review of the explicit form of the D3-brane solution given in [13]. If we take <lb/>the AdS  5  metric as <lb/> ds <lb/> 2 <lb/>AdS5  = L <lb/> 2 <lb/> ( ( <lb/> 2πα <lb/> ′  U <lb/>L  2 <lb/> )  2  ( <lb/> dr <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  + r <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  dψ <lb/> 2  + dr <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  + r <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  dϕ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ) <lb/> + <lb/> dU <lb/> 2 <lb/> U  2 <lb/> ) <lb/> , <lb/> (14) <lb/>then the loop can be assumed to be located at r  1  = R, r  2  = 0, which corresponds to the world volume <lb/>parametrization σ <lb/> 1  = ψ, σ <lb/> 2  = r  2  and σ <lb/> 3  , σ <lb/> 4  parametrize S <lb/> 2  which shrinks at the boundary σ <lb/> 2  = r  2  = 0. <lb/>In this case, the half BPS nature is strong enough to fix the form of the classical solution uniquely once <lb/>we take account of only the gauge field boundary condition Π <lb/> a=1  = −ik. Essentially the solution takes <lb/>the same form as in [14] and near the boundary r  2  ≪ 1, it looks like <lb/> U ∼ <lb/> κ <lb/> √ <lb/> λ <lb/> 2πr  2 <lb/> , A  1  ∼ <lb/>−iRκ <lb/>√ <lb/> λ <lb/> 2πr  2 <lb/> , <lb/> (15) <lb/>where κ is defined below (7). Plugging the solution into the action, we have <lb/> S  D3  + S  b  = −N <lb/> ( <lb/> 2κ <lb/> √ <lb/> 1 + κ  2  + 2arcsinh κ <lb/> ) <lb/> . <lb/> (16) <lb/>Then according to (13) we can calculate ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ as <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = <lb/> ∫ <lb/> e <lb/> −(S  D3-brane  +S  b  ) <lb/> = exp (−(S  D3-brane  + S  b  ))|  cl <lb/> = exp <lb/> [ <lb/> N <lb/> ( <lb/> 2κ <lb/> √ <lb/> 1 + κ  2  + 2arcsinh κ <lb/> )] <lb/> , <lb/> (17) <lb/>where in the second equality we have used λ ≫ 1. This indeed agrees with the gauge theory result (8). <lb/>Since ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ is quite a complicated function, this agreement strongly supports the claim (13), at least <lb/>in strong coupling regime λ ≫ 1. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4 Boundary condition for D-brane from Wilson loop <lb/> The agreement (17) shown in [13] looks quite nice, but we emphasize here that the derivation in [13] <lb/>is not completely along the spirit of AdS/CFT. Namely, in the basic relation (13), the right hand side <lb/>will be a function of X <lb/> µ  , Π <lb/> a  and P  U  i  and their boundary conditions should be provided in terms of the <lb/>Wilson loop. Then the path integral, or the evaluation of the classical action should be done under these <lb/>boundary conditions. In contrast to this, in [13] they do not take account of the boundary condition <lb/>for P  U  i  and rather they evaluate the action from the explicit form of the classical solution which can be <lb/>uniquely fixed due to many supersymmetries the configuration preserves. It should be noticed that in <lb/>the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the boundary term and the boundary condition should be <lb/>specified in (13) in terms of the Wilson loop without referring to the equation of motion. Moreover, a <lb/>prescription itself of giving boundary conditions from a Wilson loop would be generic and independent of <lb/>its shape. Thus our aim is to deduce D3-brane boundary conditions for generic shape of the Wilson loop <lb/>without using the equation of motion. Our problem is quite unique, because usually a D-brane specifies <lb/>boundary conditions for an open string attached to it, while in the present case we are considering <lb/>boundary conditions for a D-brane itself imposed by a Wilson loop. <lb/> 4.1 Derivation of boundary conditions <lb/> For our purpose, let us take the (Wick rotated) AdS  5  ×S <lb/> 5  metric as <lb/> ds <lb/> 2  = <lb/> ( <lb/> 2πα <lb/> ′  U <lb/>L <lb/> )  2 <lb/> (dt <lb/> 2  + dρ <lb/> 2  + ρ <lb/> 2  (dθ <lb/> 2  + sin <lb/> 2  θdϕ <lb/> 2  )) + L <lb/> 2  (dU <lb/> i  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> U  2  , <lb/> (18) <lb/>where the gauge theory lives in the four-dimensional space-time parametrized by t, ρ, θ and ϕ, and the <lb/>AdS boundary exists at U = ∞. We choose t, ρ in such a way that a loop of generic shape is located <lb/>at ρ = 0, and that it is extended into the t-direction in the four-dimensional space-time. A D3-brane <lb/>is in the AdS  5  , and is attached to the loop ρ = 0 at the AdS boundary. We take σ <lb/> a  (a = 1 ∼ 4) as <lb/>the D3-brane world volume coordinates, hence world volume fields are embedding coordinates t = t(σ <lb/> a  ), <lb/> ρ = ρ(σ <lb/> a  ), · · · , U <lb/> i  = U <lb/> i  (σ <lb/> a  ), and the U (1) gauge field A  a  (σ <lb/> a  ). As before, we take σ <lb/> a  in such a way <lb/>that the world volume boundary is at σ <lb/> 2  = 0, and there the boundary itself is parametrized by σ <lb/> 1  . Thus <lb/> ρ → 0 as σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> → 0. Note that at the beginning the world volume boundary has nothing to do with the <lb/>AdS boundary U = ∞. Rather, we impose a condition later that the world volume boundary is located <lb/>at the AdS boundary. As for other world volume coordinates, it is natural to set σ <lb/> 3  = θ, σ <lb/> 4  = ϕ. Near <lb/>the world volume boundary σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∼ 0, ρ ∼ 0, then the S <lb/> 2  parametrized by σ <lb/> 3  and σ <lb/> 4  shrinks, hence all <lb/>fields become independent of them. Namely, at least near the world volume boundary, t, ρ and U <lb/> i  are <lb/>fields only of σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  : t = t(σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  ), ρ = ρ(σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  ) U <lb/> i  = U <lb/> i  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  ) for σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> ∼ 0. As for the gauge field, at <lb/>the world volume boundary it is along the σ <lb/> 1  -direction as we discussed above (14): A  a=1  = A  a=1  (σ <lb/> 2  ). <lb/>Using these coordinate choice, let us consider the D3-brane action.

			<body>Let us examine what this equation means at the world volume boundary, i.e. ρ → 0 (σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> → 0) <lb/> 3  . Here we <lb/>make a crucial requirement that when σ <lb/> 2 <lb/> → 0, U → ∞. Namely, the world volume boundary lies at the <lb/>AdS boundary. Then the constraint is greatly simplified to yield <lb/> P <lb/> 2 <lb/> U  i  + (Π <lb/> 1  ) <lb/> 2  (∂  1  t) <lb/> 2  = 0, at σ <lb/> 2  = 0. <lb/>(22) <lb/>As discussed in subsection 3.2, a natural boundary condition for the gauge field is Π <lb/> 1  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −ik <lb/> for each σ <lb/> 1  . Plugging this into the above, we get P  U  i  = −k |∂  1  t| θ  i  with θ  i  = U  i  /U being S <lb/> 5  coordinate, <lb/>where we have used P  U  i  = (U <lb/> i  /U )P  U  and chosen the minus sign in order to make it consistent with the <lb/>equation of motion. This is only the point we refer to information of the equation of motion. However, <lb/>at σ <lb/> 2  = 0, the loop is assumed to be extended along the t-direction and the D3-brane world volume <lb/>is attached to it. Thus we have |∂  1  t| = | ˙ <lb/> X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  )| at least in a local patch around a point on the loop. <lb/>By using the Dirichlet boundary condition for X <lb/> µ  : X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), we find that |∂  1  t| can be <lb/>identified with | ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ <lb/> | at least in a local patch. Thus we see that the Hamiltonian constraint (21) at the <lb/>world volume boundary σ <lb/> 2  = 0 under the requirement U (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = ∞ implies the following boundary <lb/>conditions: <lb/> X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/>(23) <lb/>Π <lb/> 1  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −ik, <lb/> P  U  i  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −k <lb/> ˙ <lb/> x(σ <lb/> 1  ) <lb/> θ  i  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/>(24) <lb/>where we have again identified s with σ <lb/> 1  by using the reparametrization of the loop. By use of the <lb/>embedding coordinates X <lb/> µ  , we can convert the world volume indices of Π <lb/> a  into the space-time ones like <lb/>Π <lb/> µ <lb/> ≡ ∂  a  X <lb/> µ  Π <lb/> a  . Since Π <lb/> a  has the only non-vanishing component for a = 1, Π <lb/> µ  satisfies the following <lb/>boundary condition <lb/>Π <lb/> µ  = ∂  1  X <lb/> µ  Π <lb/> 1  = −ik ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  , <lb/> at σ <lb/> 2  = 0, <lb/>(25) <lb/>where we have used (23). Using the second boundary condition in (24), this gives the following relation <lb/>(Π <lb/> µ  ) <lb/> 2  + (P  U  i  ) <lb/> 2  = 0 . <lb/> (26) <lb/>It is worth noting that the boundary condition (24) thus corresponds to the BPS condition in [14], i.e., <lb/>force balance between the electric charge Π <lb/> 1  and the deformation of the D3-brane which is characterized <lb/>by P  U  i  , in the case of the spike solution in the flat space. Since the spike solution presented in [14] is <lb/>the half BPS, it is natural that the equation (26) also implies a local BPS condition for the Wilson loop. <lb/>In fact, in the gauge theory side, the local BPS condition for the Wilson loop (1) is given by <lb/>˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 2  = ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (27) <lb/>as commented in section 2. For the Wilson loop satisfying this condition, ˙ <lb/> y  i  = | ˙ <lb/> x|θ  i  . Therefore, by using <lb/>this relation in (24), we deduce boundary conditions in a general case as <lb/>Π <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −ik ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/> P  U  i  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −k ˙ <lb/> y  i  (σ <lb/> 1  ). <lb/>(28) <lb/>We find our boundary condition quite natural because once it is assumed, the local BPS conditions in <lb/>both sides become equivalent. From the point of view of our general boundary conditions (28), (24) are <lb/>those in a local patch along the loop where the loop can be regarded as the straight line with ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 2  = ˙ <lb/> y <lb/> 2  . <lb/>In summary, the Wilson loop with winding number k of O(N ) given in (1) provides following boundary <lb/>conditions on a D3-brane in the AdS/CFT correspondence: <lb/>Dirichlet for X <lb/> µ  : <lb/> X <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/>(29) <lb/>Neumann for A  a  : <lb/>Π <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −ik ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  (σ <lb/> 1  ), <lb/> ( <lb/> Π <lb/> µ  = <lb/> ∂X <lb/> µ <lb/> ∂σ  1  Π <lb/> 1 <lb/> ) <lb/> (30) <lb/>Neumann for U <lb/> i  : <lb/> P  U  i  (σ <lb/> 1  , σ <lb/> 2  = 0) = −k ˙ <lb/> y  i  (σ <lb/> 1  ). <lb/>(31) <lb/></body>

			<body> Note that these are in accordance with the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence: the boundary condi-<lb/>tions are given in terms of the data of the Wilson loop x <lb/> µ  (s), y <lb/> i  (s) and k, namely the shape of the loop <lb/>and the winding number. <lb/>There are several evidences supporting our boundary conditions. For example, they are consistent <lb/>with the boundary conditions for the string world sheet (k = 1) case. Moreover, we can explicitly check <lb/>that the D3-brane solution obtained in [13] which we briefly review in subsection 3.2 actually satisfies our <lb/>boundary conditions. Here we again emphasize that in our derivation we do not refer to the equation of <lb/>motion, hence this fact is an evidence for validity of our boundary conditions. Another interesting aspect <lb/>of our boundary condition is that under them the Gauss&apos; law constraint Π <lb/> a=2  = 0 implies ∂σ <lb/> 2  /∂σ <lb/> 1  = 0, <lb/>namely orthogonality relation between the tangential and perpendicular directions of the world volume <lb/>boundary. <lb/> 5 Bulk interpretation of the position of eigenvalue <lb/> In this section as an application of our boundary conditions (29)∼(31), we examine what happens if they <lb/>are applied to the basic relation (13). As mentioned in (17), when λ ≫ 1, the path integral in the right <lb/>hand side in (13) can be replaced by e <lb/> −S <lb/> cl <lb/> D3  −S <lb/> cl <lb/> b  where the action is evaluated by its classical value under <lb/>the boundary conditions (29)∼(31). Therefore, for λ ≫ 1, we have <lb/> ⟨W  k  (C)⟩ = e <lb/> −  (S <lb/> cl <lb/>D3  +S <lb/> cl <lb/> b  )|  b.c.  , <lb/> (32) <lb/>where |  b.c.  denotes the evaluation under (29)∼(31). Thus the exponent of ⟨W  k  (C)⟩, V  eff  (k) defined below <lb/>(8) can be read from this equation as V  eff  (k) = <lb/> ( <lb/> S <lb/> cl <lb/>D3  + S <lb/> cl <lb/> b <lb/> ) <lb/> b.c. <lb/> . Then by using the fact we mentioned at <lb/>the end of section 2, we can make a connection between the position of the isolated eigenvalue m  *  and <lb/>the bulk quantity as <lb/> m  *  = −V <lb/> ′ <lb/> eff  (k) = − <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂k <lb/> ( <lb/> S <lb/> cl <lb/>D3  + S <lb/> cl <lb/> b <lb/> ) <lb/> b.c. <lb/> . <lb/> (33) <lb/>In order to calculate this, it is instructive to notice that k is a part of the boundary conditions and <lb/>as such variation of k gives rise to that of the classical action. However, the variation of the classical <lb/>action only comes from the boundary action due to the equation of motion. More precisely, for the <lb/>Dirichlet direction the variation is given as (10), while that for the Neumann direction is as (11). From <lb/>the boundary conditions (29)∼(31), the variation with respect to k does not affect the Dirichlet direction <lb/> X <lb/> µ  . Thus as in (11) the variation comes only from the boundary term <lb/> S <lb/> cl <lb/> b  = <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1  dσ <lb/> 3  dσ <lb/> 4  (Π <lb/> 1  A  1  + P  U  i  U <lb/> i  ). <lb/>(34) <lb/>Now from (30) and (31), we obtain <lb/> S <lb/> cl <lb/> b <lb/> b.c. <lb/> = −k <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1 <lb/> ( <lb/> iA  1  ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 1  + U <lb/> i  ˙ <lb/> y  i <lb/> ) <lb/> . <lb/> (35) <lb/>Notice here that in (29)∼(31), the integration over S <lb/> 2  -part (namely σ <lb/> 3  and σ <lb/> 4  ) is done as in (19) and <lb/>(20). Therefore we finally find that <lb/> m  *  = − <lb/> ∂ S <lb/> cl <lb/> b <lb/> b.c. <lb/> ∂k <lb/> = <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1 <lb/> ( <lb/> iA  1  ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 1  + U <lb/> i  ˙ <lb/> y  i <lb/> ) <lb/> . <lb/> (36) <lb/>Thus we obtain a clear interpretation of the isolated eigenvalue as a bulk quantity, namely as flux of the <lb/>gauge field, more precisely, an integration over the U (1) gauge field plus the scalar field along the loop. <lb/>As for this result, several notes are in order: first of all, the above derivation is exactly in accordance <lb/>with the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence in contrast to the result in [13] where they use the explicit <lb/>form of the solution to the equation of motion as in (15) to get (16). On the other hand, in our derivation <lb/>we do not use the explicit form of the solution. Rather, plugging it into (36), we obtain <lb/> ∫ <lb/> σ  2  =0 <lb/> dσ <lb/> 1 <lb/> ( <lb/> iA  1  ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> 1  + U <lb/> i  ˙ <lb/> y  i <lb/> ) <lb/> = <lb/> √ <lb/> λ(1 + κ  2  ), <lb/>(37) <lb/></body>

			<body>which indeed reproduces the gauge theory result below (7). This is a nontrivial consistency check of <lb/>our boundary conditions. It is also important to recognize that the boundary condition for U <lb/> i  in (31) <lb/>plays an essential role in deriving (37), which is missed in [13]. Finally we note that we again have (the <lb/>exponent of) the U (1) Wilson loop. It would be quite an interesting aspect of our result, although the <lb/> U (1) gauge field on the D3-brane in the bulk of course should not be confused with the original U (N ) <lb/>gauge field on the N D3-brane in the gauge theory side. <lb/> 6 Conclusions <lb/> We have analyzed the circular Wilson loop with winding number k of O(N ) in the gauge theory by using a <lb/>D3-brane carrying k units of charge in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. It is known that the <lb/>calculation of the expectation value of this Wilson loop in the gauge theory side amounts to considering <lb/>a Gaussian matrix model with an exponential operator insertion due to its symmetry. In this calculation <lb/>an isolated eigenvalue plays an essential role. After emphasizing importance of boundary conditions the <lb/>Wilson loop imposes on the gravity side, we deduce them based on the Hamiltonian constraint. We <lb/>have checked that our boundary conditions pass several nontrivial tests. As an application, we have <lb/>taken account of them in the AdS/CFT correspondence for the Wilson loop and succeeded in giving an <lb/>interesting interpretation in terms of fields in the gravity side to the position of the eigenvalue in the <lb/>matrix model. <lb/></body>
