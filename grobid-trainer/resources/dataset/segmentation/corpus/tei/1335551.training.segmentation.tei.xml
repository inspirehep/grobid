			<body> I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>The interaction between a (relativistic) beam and its sur-<lb/>roundings is usually described in terms of longitudinal <lb/>and transverse coupling impedance [1]. The longitudinal <lb/>impedance accounts for the energy lost by a point charge <lb/> q because of the wake field of a leading particle; assuming <lb/>an infinitely long pipe, for a relativistic beam it is defined <lb/>as <lb/> Z   = − <lb/> 1 <lb/> q <lb/>  ∞ <lb/>−∞ <lb/> E  z  (r = 0; ω) exp <lb/> j <lb/>ω <lb/>c <lb/>z <lb/> dz <lb/> (1) <lb/>where E  z  is the longitudinal electric field and c is the <lb/>speed of light. Instead the transverse kick experienced by <lb/>a particle because of deflecting fields excited by a leading <lb/>charge, can be described in terms of the transverse cou-<lb/>pling impedance <lb/> Z  ⊥  = <lb/> j <lb/>q  2 <lb/>  ∞ <lb/>−∞ <lb/> F  ⊥  (r  1  , r  2  ; ω) <lb/>r  1 <lb/> exp <lb/> j <lb/>ω <lb/>c <lb/>z <lb/> dz <lb/> (2) <lb/>where F  ⊥  is the transverse Lorentz force and r  1  (r  2  ) <lb/>is the leading (trailing) particle position. Longitudinal <lb/>impedance is, therefore, measured in Ω while the trans-<lb/>verse one in Ω/m. <lb/> After the introduction of the beam coupling impedance <lb/>concept by V. Vaccaro it was realized soon that for highly <lb/>relativistic beams a very close similarity exists between the <lb/>TEM like field of the charged particles and the field of a <lb/>wire in a coaxial structure. This is the basis and motivation <lb/>of the coaxial wire method. <lb/>We review the early concepts of this method in order <lb/>to show the motivation; we show some issues (and ad-<lb/>vantages) concerning the practical implementation of those <lb/>concepts with modern instruments and then eventually we <lb/>discuss some recent applications. <lb/>Longitudinal impedance measurements are straightfor-<lb/>ward, but also transverse impedance measurements using <lb/>two wires carrying currents with opposite polarity were al-<lb/>ready done on the late 70ths. The concept was extended <lb/>to the evaluation of dipole and quadrupolar impedances by <lb/>applying a single displaced wire and pair of wires. <lb/>We discuss the basis of those methods and present some <lb/>examples relevant for modern accelerator components. <lb/>II. THE COAXIAL WIRE METHOD <lb/>The field of a relativistic point charge q in the free space <lb/>(or in a perfectly conducting beam pipe) is a Transverse <lb/>Electric Magnetic (TEM) wave, namely it has only com-<lb/>ponents transverse to the propagation direction (z-axis). <lb/>The amplitude scales inversely with the distance r from <lb/>the propagation axis and the propagation constant is ω/c. <lb/> The fundamental mode of a coaxial wave guide is a TEM <lb/>wave as well, with the same amplitude dependence on 1/r <lb/> and the same propagation constant. <lb/>Therefore the excitation due to a relativistic beam in a <lb/>given Device Under Test (DUT) can be &quot; simulated &quot; by ex-<lb/>citing a TEM field by means of a conductor placed along <lb/>the axis of the structure. The impedance source on the <lb/>DUT will scatter some field, i.e. exciting some higher or-<lb/>der modes; such modes must not propagate otherwise the <lb/>propagating field will not be anymore similar to the the <lb/>TEM beam field. In principle, then, simulating the beam <lb/>field with the TEM mode of a coaxial waveguide is possi-<lb/>ble only at frequencies below the first higher mode cut-off, <lb/>namely below the TM  01  cut-off frequency. One can also <lb/>demonstrate that the modes of the coaxial waveguide con-<lb/></body>

			<body>verges for vanishing wire radius to the analogous mode of <lb/>the cylindrical waveguide, at least at the beam pipe bound-<lb/>ary, where the impedance source is usually located. <lb/>To compare the excitation of a given DUT by a coax-<lb/>ial wire and with the beam itself, we are going to dis-<lb/>cuss some measurements done in the framework of the in-<lb/>vestigations of the shielding properties of coated ceramic <lb/>vacuum chambers [2]. The 500 MeV CERN EPA elec-<lb/>tron beam was sent through two identical ceramic vacuum <lb/>chamber sections; the first one was internally coated with <lb/>a layer of 1.5 µm depth (DC resistance of 1Ω). Mag-<lb/>netic field probes were placed to measure the beam field <lb/>just outside the two ceramic chambers (the coated and the <lb/>reference one). In a first experiment, shielding properties <lb/>of the resistive coating (thinner than the skin depth) were <lb/>demonstrated, confirming previous indirect measurements <lb/>and simulations [3]. In a following experiment, among <lb/>other results, it was proved that the screening properties of <lb/>the coating can be spoiled by the addition of a second con-<lb/>ducting layer placed outside the field probes and electri-<lb/>cally connected to the metallic vacuum chamber sections. <lb/>In this case, in fact, the magnetic field probe was measur-<lb/>ing clearly the field of the 1ns (r.m.s.) bunched beam (see <lb/>Fig. 1). <lb/>The same chamber in the same configuration (i.e. with <lb/>this additional external conductor) was then measured in <lb/>the bench set-up: a 0.8 mm diameter wire was stretched <lb/>on the axis of the structure. One end of the wire was con-<lb/>nected to a 50Ω load while the other end was connected <lb/>to one port of a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA); match-<lb/>ing resistors were used. The other port of the VNA was <lb/>connected to the field probe. The network analyzer was <lb/>set to send through the wire a synthetic pulse (time do-<lb/>main option) with 300 MHz bandwidth and measured the <lb/>transmission between the ports, i.e. the signal through the <lb/>probe. <lb/>This particular kind of set-up is not very often used, but <lb/>it is very similar to the &quot; time domain &quot; measurement origi-<lb/>nally proposed by Sands and Rees in the 70s [4]; nowadays <lb/>time domain measurements are often performed with syn-<lb/>thetic pulse techniques in many microwaves applications. <lb/>The measurement with the beam and with the wire should <lb/>give virtually the same result, apart from a scaling factor <lb/>due to the difference of the power carried by the beam and <lb/>by the VNA signal. The results are shown in Fig. 1 where <lb/>the beam and the bench data have been normalized and <lb/>time shifted so that the traces coincides in their minimum <lb/>point. <lb/>The external shield, having a DC resistance much <lb/>smaller than the coating, carries the image currents, the <lb/>field penetrates the ceramic and the field probe can mea-<lb/>sure a clear signal. This is only one of the configurations <lb/>measured both with the beam and in the bench set-up; the <lb/>agreement with other measurements is similar to the one <lb/>of Fig. 1. <lb/>The results of that comparison confirm the validity of the <lb/>coaxial wire approach to simulate the beam field effect on a <lb/>given DUT. Coaxial wire measurement are widely used to <lb/>estimate impedances of many accelerator devices. Among <lb/>many possible examples, we discuss issue of recent mea-<lb/>surement on LHC collimators. <lb/> A. TCTP LHC collimator impedance measurement <lb/> The collimation system of the LHC is one of the largest <lb/>impedance contributors of the machine, in particular for <lb/>its transverse imaginary part. In particular, a concern <lb/>arose for the TCTP tertiary collimator: potentially harmful <lb/>trapped modes close to 100 and 200 MHz have been found. <lb/>The effect of the trapped modes depends on the collima-<lb/>tor tungsten jaws opening. Detailed simulation and bench <lb/>measurements have been therefore performed. Eventually <lb/>proper ferrite absorbers have been designed to try to dump <lb/>them. <lb/>In the TCTP collimator, the main components of inter-<lb/>est from a beam impedance reduction point of view are the <lb/>longitudinal RF fingers that cover the transition from the <lb/>beam pipe to the collimator structure, the transitions host-<lb/>ing the BPM buttons and the RF system utilizing ferrite <lb/>blocks and a screen structure as shown in Fig. 2. <lb/>In order to match the DUT (i.e. the collimator de-<lb/>vice) with the VNA, a matching network needs to be de-<lb/>signed. The standard procedure requires the knowledge of <lb/>the DUT transmission line impedance Z  c  . In modern net-<lb/>work analyzers it is possible to recover this information <lb/>by means of a time domain reflectometry measurement: <lb/>the reflection coefficients Γ are measured from both the <lb/>DUT ports and the corresponding input impedance calcu-<lb/>lated from <lb/> Z  c  = Z  0 <lb/> 1 + Γ <lb/>1 − Γ <lb/> , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where Z  0  is usually the 50 Ω cable impedance. Figure 3 <lb/>shows the characteristic impedance for 3 jaws openings in <lb/>the collimator: for large gaps, Z  c  appears flat, while, for <lb/>smaller gaps the reflections at the BPM transitions become <lb/>more and more evident. For practical reasons, therefore, <lb/>the stretched wire method can be only applied assuming <lb/>an average value for Z  c  230 Ω taken at the jaws location <lb/>for intermediate jaws opening. It is moreover interesting to <lb/>notice how the wire profile could be inferred from the short <lb/>gap measurements: the flatness of the impedance curve <lb/>could be used as a wire-based jaws alignment method. The <lb/>coaxial line characteristic impedance depends, indeed, on <lb/>the mutual position of the jaws and the wire and the dif-<lb/>ference between Z  1,1  and Z  2,2  is due to difference on the <lb/>mutual position of the jaws and wire at the two sides of the <lb/>collimator. Such measurement technique could be used to <lb/>bench measure the (hopefully small) jaws misalignments <lb/>with a high level of precision, opening to metrological is-<lb/></body>

			<body>sues still to be investigated. <lb/>The longitudinal impedance can be calculated from the <lb/>transmission parameters through the improved logarithmic <lb/>formula [5] and provides an insight on the shunt impedance <lb/>value in function of the collimator gap. Varying, then, the <lb/>transverse wire position we can get informations on the <lb/>TCTP transverse impedance. Figure 4 shows the calcu-<lb/>lated impedance value for the detected trapped mode at <lb/>100 and 200 MHz. The absolute value might not be ac-<lb/>curate depending on the field pattern perturbation of the <lb/>mode due to the wire, nevertheless it is useful for compar-<lb/>isons once the mode damping ferrite will be installed in the <lb/>TCTP collimator. <lb/>III. BEAD PULL TECHNIQUES <lb/>An important class of accelerator devices are cavities <lb/>which are now used both for accelerating and deflecting <lb/>the particle beam. Each cavity is characterized by its res-<lb/>onant frequency f  0  , the quality factor of the resonance Q <lb/> and its shunt impedance R. One can think of measuring all <lb/>these quantities with the coaxial wire set-up, i.e. measur-<lb/>ing strong notches in the transmission scattering coefficient <lb/>between the ends of the wire. But the wire perturbs longi-<lb/>tudinal cavity modes, e.g. lowers the Q and detunes the <lb/>frequency. Therefore the coaxial wire set-up is not usually <lb/>recommended for cavity measurements and it is advisable <lb/>only for special cases, mainly transverse modes [6]. <lb/>The most used technique to characterize cavities is the <lb/> &quot; bead pull &quot; measurement [7]. The field in the cavity can be <lb/>sampled by introducing a perturbing object and measuring <lb/>the change in resonant frequency: where the field is max-<lb/>imum (minimum) the resonance frequency will be more <lb/>(less) perturbed. It is a perturbation method, therefore the <lb/>perturbing object must be so small that the field does not <lb/>vary significantly over its largest linear dimension. Shaped <lb/>beads are used to enhance perturbation and give directional <lb/>selectivity among different field components. <lb/>Quantitatively, the change of the resonant frequency is <lb/>related to the perturbed cavity field by the Slater theorem. <lb/>The frequency variation can be measured by the variation <lb/>of the phase at the unperturbed resonant frequency, ac-<lb/>cording to Ref. [9]. Even if a very precise initial tuning <lb/>is needed, this method allows easily measuring the field <lb/>of many points (as many as the points of the instrument <lb/>trace). The field shape can also be directly visualized on <lb/>the instrument screen, greatly facilitating the structure tun-<lb/>ing procedure. <lb/>Novel accelerating devices RF structures foresee a <lb/>standing wave part is tightly connected to a traveling wave <lb/>one, thus the Slater resonant approach is not suitable. <lb/>Non resonant perturbation theory was first proposed by <lb/>Steele [10] and allows the measurement of electromagnetic <lb/>field in the perturbing bead position by measuring the com-<lb/>plex variation of the reflection coefficient at a given fre-<lb/>quency ω, i.e. <lb/> ∆S  11  = S  11,p  (ω) − S  11,u  (ω) = −jωk  ST  E <lb/> 2  /P  inc  , (4) <lb/>where S  11,p  (S  11,u  ) is the perturbed (unperturbed) reflec-<lb/>tion coefficient, P  inc  the average power entering the e.m. <lb/>structure, k  ST  a constant and E the electric field at the <lb/>bead position and at frequency ω. Non resonant perturba-<lb/>tion method (in the following referred to as Steele method) <lb/>is the only way to measure e.m. field in non resonant RF <lb/>structures through a bead pull technique; it is used in res-<lb/>onant structures when one is interested also in the phase <lb/>behavior of the field. Equation 4 is written only for electric <lb/>field, but a more general relation can be found in Ref. [10]. <lb/> A. SPARC X-band cavity <lb/> As an example we can consider simulations and mea-<lb/>surements done on an 11.424 GHz standing wave multi-<lb/>cell cavity, designed for the SPARC photo-injector [11]. <lb/>The cavity is supposed to work in the π-mode (all the cells <lb/>are filled with field) exhibiting a maximum field equal in <lb/>every cell (field flatness). A 9 cells prototype has been de-<lb/>signed and built and all the details are reported in Ref. [12] <lb/>while a picture is given in Fig. 5. We will present measured <lb/>data against numerical simulation results for the electric <lb/>field on axis. <lb/>Figure 6 compares measured data against numerical <lb/>simulation results for the electric field on axis. The field <lb/>has a maximum/minimum in the center of every cell and <lb/>the tuners have been set to have the required field flatness. <lb/>The main measurement artifact was the non-negligible ef-<lb/>fect of the glue used to fix the bead on a plastic wire to be <lb/>moved by the stepping motor; therefore the glue effect was <lb/>measured and calibrated away resulting in the data reported <lb/>in Fig. 6. Numerical codes gives very close results among <lb/>each other and they all agree well with measurements. <lb/> B. Compact micro-accelerators <lb/> X-band particle accelerators benefit from a reduced size <lb/>and an higher accelerating field with respect to the stan-<lb/>dard S-band accelerators, nowadays used for high bright-<lb/>ness electron beam production. High accelerating field <lb/>in X-band, of 200 MV/m peak, allows the production of <lb/>high brightness beams. We have proposed a design a novel <lb/>Òhybrid gunÓ from an electromagnetic and beam dynam-<lb/>ics point of view together with the low power RF char-<lb/>acterization of a preliminary copper prototype of such a <lb/>gun [13, 14]. <lb/>The hybrid gun is a structure where the Standing Wave <lb/>(SW) part hosting the cathode is tightly coupled to the <lb/>Travelling Wave (TW) section through a coupling cell; a <lb/>prototype is shown in Fig. 7. Such a device strongly mit-<lb/>igates impedance mismatches, and therefore reflected RF <lb/>power, during and after the RF filling of the SW section. <lb/>Therefore no circulator is needed to protect the klystron <lb/></body>

			<body>and this solves the problem of the absence of high power <lb/>circulator in X-band. <lb/>The hybrid gun avoids the bunch lengthening observed <lb/>during the drift in a split (conventional) photo-injector. The <lb/>bunch is indeed strongly focused longitudinally through <lb/>velocity bunching, due to 90 <lb/> • <lb/> phase shift between SW <lb/>cell and input coupler. Numerical studies have shown that <lb/>the emittance compensation dynamics remains manage-<lb/>able even in the presence of strong compression. <lb/>We have studied the design of the hybrid gun from an <lb/>electromagnetic and beam dynamics point of view. Exten-<lb/>sive numerical simulations have shown the control of beam <lb/>size and emittance and the possibility of tuning the work-<lb/>ing point by changing the temperature of the SW part in the <lb/>few Celsius degree range. The electromagnetic design has <lb/>been finalized, according to the most recent design criteria <lb/>of high gradient accelerating RF structures. <lb/>Preliminary field measurement on a first prototype are <lb/>shown in Fig. 8. According to Eq. 4, the reflection coeffi-<lb/>cient as a function of the bead position is proportional to <lb/>the field seen by the particle. The non resonant method <lb/>allows to characterise both the SW and the T W part. <lb/>IV. CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In this paper we review the common bench methods to <lb/>measure coupling impedance for particle accelerator de-<lb/>vice, both resonant and non resonant. Such methods are <lb/>widely used nowadays due to characterise most of the de-<lb/>vices installed in modern accelerators. we have focused <lb/>our attention to devices used in state-of-the-art accelera-<lb/>tors. Collimators are an open issue for the LHC impedance <lb/>budget and a careful estimation of their impedance is cur-<lb/>rently ongoing. On the side of compact accelerators, the <lb/>X-band technology is currently being investigated as well <lb/>as innovative RF designs; we have reviewed the measure-<lb/>ment techniques needed to bench measure such devices. <lb/></body>
