			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> Inspired by the area scaling of the black hole entropy and the generalized second law of <lb/>thermodynamics, it is conjectured that the maximum entropy contained in a system can not exceed <lb/>its boundary area in Planck units [1–3]. The conjecture afterwards is called holographic principle. The <lb/>entropy with an area scaling is usually called holographic entropy. <lb/>The microscopic origin of holographic entropy has always been a question to be answered. In the <lb/>original paper of holographic prinple, t&apos; Hooft [1] has studied the maximum entropy that can be provided <lb/></body>

			<body> by an ordinary quantum field theory. Assuming the system is at some temperature T , the corresponding <lb/>energy and entropy of the system can be evaluated as <lb/> E =c  1  zV T <lb/> 4  , <lb/>S =c  2  zV T <lb/> 3  , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where z is explained as the number of different particle species, c  1  , c  2  are numerical constants of order <lb/>one which depend on the concrete properties of the particles. Such thermodynamic behaviors can easily <lb/>be found by dimensional analysis. For the system to be gravitational stable, we must require E = <lb/> c  1  zV T <lb/> 4  ≤ E  bh  ∼ L which means the energy of the system should be less than the energy of a black <lb/>hole of the same size. This leads to the critical temperature T ≤ c  3  z <lb/> −1/4  L <lb/> −1/2  . Substituting it into the <lb/>formula of entropy, one gets an entropy bound for conventional field theory <lb/> S ≤ c  4  z <lb/> 1/4  A <lb/> 3/4  , <lb/> (2) <lb/>where A is the boundary area of the system. <lb/>We have adopted the Planck units where <lb/> G =  = c = k  B  = 1 in order to simplify the expressions. If the number of particle species z is an <lb/>unimportant constant, the maximum entropy will be <lb/> A/l <lb/> 2 <lb/> p <lb/>  3/4  by recovering units, where l  p  is the Planck <lb/>length. Thus there is an entropy gap between the A <lb/> 3/4  entropy bound for conventional filed theory and <lb/>the holographic entropy [4–8]. The result is also verified by a direct examination of gravitational stable <lb/>Hilbert space for bosonic and fermionic fields [6]. <lb/>To fill the entropy gap from A <lb/> 3/4  to A , one must resort to other mechanisms for extra degrees of <lb/>freedom (DOFs). A fast observation is that, if one assumes a large number of particle species z, the <lb/>entropy gap can be filled continuously. Especially, assuming z ∼ L <lb/> 2  /l <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  , the setting of E = E  bh  ∼ L <lb/> leads to the temperature T = c  3  z <lb/> −1/4  L <lb/> −1/2  ∼ 1/L and the entropy <lb/> S = c  4  z <lb/> 1/4  A <lb/> 3/4  ∼ A. <lb/> (3) <lb/>The scaling behaviors exactly coincide with those of black hole thermodynamics. Obviously, the large z <lb/> plays an essential role in the derivation. This scheme of introducing a large number of particle species for <lb/>overcoming the entropy gap is first suggested in [9] by Horvat. It is amazing that the entire holographic <lb/>thermodynamics can be derived in such a straightforward way. Whatever, in this context, explaining z as <lb/>the number of particle species may lead to some problems. First, it is hard to explain the origin of such <lb/>a large number of particle species which are absent in standard model of particle physics. Second, it is <lb/>hard to answer the question why the number of particle species z is related to the size of the system. <lb/>On the other hand, as suggested by Hsu [8], one should consider the influence of space-time metric in <lb/>order to fill the entropy gap. The A <lb/> 3/4  entropy bound may be only applicable to weak-gravitational <lb/>systems, because the original derivation only takes E ≤ E  bh  as a global limitation to the system. <lb/>When the system has such a large energy, the dominant self-gravitational interaction will lead to a <lb/>strongly curved space-time metric. So a complete derivation should use the thermodynamics in a curved <lb/>space-time rather than directly using the results in the Minkowski space-time. <lb/>In this paper, we study the thermodynamics for a system living in a curved space-time using a <lb/>formulism originated and developed in [10,11]. From our result, the large value of z in Equation (3) <lb/>can be seen as an effect of space-time metric. Notice that the parameter z will not be explained as <lb/></body>

			<body> the number of particle species from now on, because we shall start from a system consisting of only <lb/>one kind of particles. Strong gravitational field naturally induces a large enhancement of the DOFs in <lb/>the formulae of energy and entropy for the thermodynamics of the system, which is reflected by the <lb/>parameter z. Hence we can understand the successful filling-up of the entropy gap in Equation (3) <lb/>because it has considered gravitational effect in an effective way. We shall also analyze the important <lb/>role of a large z in searching for the holographic screen for a black hole. <lb/> 2. Thermodynamics in Static Curved Space-Time <lb/> In this section, we shall study the thermodynamics of a system living in a static space-time with the <lb/>aim of seeing how a large z can be produced in a strong gravitational region. <lb/>First, we count the number of quantum states for a particle to occupy when it is put in a curved <lb/>space-time. In a static space-time, the energy of a particle can be defined as E = ξ  µ  k <lb/> µ  , where ξ <lb/> µ  = <lb/>(1,  0) is the killing vector of the space-time and k <lb/> µ  is the four momentum of the particle. Using the <lb/>fact that p  µ  p <lb/> µ  = m <lb/> 2  , the energy for a single particle is calculated as E = <lb/> √ <lb/> g  00  (γ <lb/> αβ  p  α  p  β  + m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2  , <lb/>where γ  αβ  is the spatial part of the metric. We also verify the energy formula from the lagrangian <lb/> L = g  µν  ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> µ  ˙ <lb/> x <lb/> ν  combined with a Legendre transformation. According to the uncertainty principle, the <lb/>number of possible single-particle states with energy less than w is <lb/> P (w) = <lb/> Θ <lb/> w − <lb/>√ <lb/> g  00  (γ <lb/> αβ  p  α  p  β  + m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>  dx <lb/> α  dp  α <lb/> (2π)  3  , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where dx <lb/> α  dp  α  is the invariant phase space element and the Heaviside step function Θ(x) is used. <lb/>Accordingly, the momentum integral requires to count all the momenta satisfying γ <lb/> αβ  p  α  p  β  ≤ w <lb/> 2  /g  00  − <lb/> m <lb/> 2  and gives a volume <lb/> 4π <lb/>3 <lb/> √ γ(w <lb/> 2  /g  00  − m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 3/2  in the momentum space [10]. It leads to <lb/> P (w) = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π)  3 <lb/>  √ <lb/> γd <lb/> 3  x <lb/> 4π <lb/>3 <lb/>( <lb/> w <lb/> 2 <lb/> g  00 <lb/> − m <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 3/2  . <lb/> (5) <lb/>With Equation (5) in hand, we can study the thermodynamic behaviors for a system living in a curved <lb/>space-time. For simplicity, we consider an idea gas consisting of one kind of relativistic massless bosons <lb/>with m = 0. The number of possible polarizations is also set to be 1. Then the number of quantum states <lb/>with energy between w to w + dw is <lb/> g(w)dw = <lb/> ∂P (w) <lb/> ∂w <lb/>dw = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π)  3 <lb/>  √ γd <lb/> 3  x <lb/> 4πw <lb/> 2  dw <lb/> ( <lb/> √ <lb/> g  00  )  3  . <lb/> (6) <lb/>At the temperature T = 1/β, the particles are assigned to the quantum states according to the <lb/>Bose-Einstein distribution. Then we get the energy of the system as <lb/> U = <lb/> w <lb/>e  βw  − 1 <lb/> g(w)dw <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π)  3 <lb/>  √ γd <lb/> 3  x <lb/> w <lb/>e  βw  − 1 <lb/>4πw <lb/> 2  dw <lb/> ( <lb/> √ g  00  )  3 <lb/> = c  1  T <lb/> 4 <lb/> √ γ <lb/> ( <lb/> √ g  00  )  3  d <lb/> 3  x, <lb/> (7) <lb/></body>

			<body> where c  1  = π <lb/> 2  /30. The temperature and energy of the system are measured by the Killing observer of <lb/>the space-time, which can be seen from the definition of the single-particle energy. The entropy of the <lb/>system is <lb/> S = lnΞ + βU = − <lb/> ln(1 − e <lb/> −βw  )g(w)dw + βU <lb/> = c  2  T <lb/> 3 <lb/> √ <lb/> γ <lb/> ( <lb/> √ <lb/> g  00  )  3  d <lb/> 3  x, <lb/> (8) <lb/>where c  2  = 2π <lb/> 2  /45, and Ξ is the partition function of the thermodynamic system [12]. Obviously, the <lb/>influence of the metric is reflected by the non-trivial factor <lb/> √ γ/( <lb/> √ g  00  ) <lb/> 3  . <lb/>In order to see clearly how the corresponding thermodynamic behaviors can be changed in a strongly <lb/>curved space-time, an example will be useful. Consider a thermodynamic system which is subject to an <lb/>external space-time metric, e.g., the Schwarzschild metric <lb/> ds <lb/> 2  = <lb/> 1 − <lb/> 2M <lb/> r <lb/> dt <lb/> 2  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>1 − <lb/> 2M <lb/> r <lb/> dr <lb/> 2  − r <lb/> 2  dΩ. <lb/> (9) <lb/>For convenience of comparison, after substituting the metric into Equations (7) and (8), the formulae of <lb/>energy and entropy can be recast into the form <lb/> U = c  1  zV T <lb/> 4  , <lb/>S = c  2  zV T <lb/> 3  , <lb/> (10) <lb/>where V = <lb/> √ γd <lb/> 3  x is the spatial volume of the system, and z is defined as <lb/> z = <lb/> √ γ/( <lb/> √ <lb/> g  00  ) <lb/> 3  d <lb/> 3  x <lb/>V <lb/> = <lb/> 1 <lb/>(1− <lb/> 2M <lb/> r <lb/> )  2  r <lb/> 2  drdΩ <lb/> 1 <lb/> √ <lb/> 1− <lb/> 2M <lb/> r <lb/> r  2  drdΩ <lb/>. <lb/> (11) <lb/>The integral above is over the region occupied by the thermodynamic system. When the system is far <lb/>from the black hole, z  1, so we recover the familiar thermodynamics for a bosonic system consisting of <lb/>relativistic massless particles like photon gas in a flat space-time, which is U = c  1  V T <lb/> 4  and S = c  2  V T <lb/> 3  . <lb/>When the system lives in a strong gravitational region close to the black hole, a large number z emerges <lb/>and changes the thermodynamic behaviors of the system. It is extremely noticeable that z diverges when <lb/>one edge of the system touches the event horizon, so one must choose some cutoff near the horizon. <lb/>We have obtained our main result that the large z in Equation (10) includes certain effects of the <lb/>curved space-time. It explains the successful derivation of the holographic entropy in Equation (3) by <lb/>introducing a large number of particle species [9], since the relevant influence of space-time metric is <lb/>included effectively. As we argued in the introduction part, directly inserting a very large number z in <lb/>Equation (3) and explaining it as the number of particle species are questionable. By comparison, due to <lb/>our formulism, the emergence of z in Equation (10) is a deduced result rather than an assumption. In fact, <lb/>to strictly derive the holographic thermodynamics, one should consider a large self-gravitational system, <lb/>use a metric generated by itself and construct the thermodynamics based on the metric. The details could <lb/>be very complex. Interestingly, the thermodynamics with a large z may be taken as an effective theory <lb/>for such a complex system, and the derivation of the holographic thermodynamics becomes possible due <lb/>to the large z. <lb/></body>

			<body> For clarity, here we provide a detailed discussion on the thermodynamics of a system in a black <lb/>hole background and show how the energy and entropy of the system change when it is lowering to the <lb/>horizon of the black hole. We shall discuss two distinct processes, which are respectively an isothermal <lb/>process and an adiabatic process. First is the isothermal process. Our result (10) shows a continuous <lb/>increase of the energy and entropy when the system approaches the black hole. To be precise, consider <lb/>a small box of photon gas and lower the system slowly to the horizon by means of a string. To maintain <lb/>the temperature observed by a distinct observer, the system must be contact with a thermal reservoir and <lb/>absorbs heat to compensate the gravitational redshift of the temperature in the lowering process. One <lb/>can easily expect a continuous increase of the entropy of the system because of the absorption of heat. In <lb/>contrast, the thermodynamic behaviors of the system will be very different when the system is lowering <lb/>adiabatically to the horizon along with an extraction of work to the outside through the string attached <lb/>to it. The increase of the value of z will not cause any increase of the entropy in the lowering process. <lb/>Because z = <lb/>  √ γ/( <lb/> √ g  00  )  3  d  3  x <lb/> √ γd  3  x <lb/> ∼ 1/( <lb/> √ <lb/> g  00  ) <lb/> 3  , its effect is offset by the redshift of T <lb/> 3  and consequently the <lb/>entropy is left unchanged. Actually according to Equation (10) there is always S ∼ U/T . The entropy <lb/>is unchanged because of the simultaneous redshift of the energy and the temperature. <lb/> 3. Thermodynamic Spheres and Holography <lb/> In this section, we still use the Schwarzschild metric (9) but turn to analyze the thermodynamic <lb/>behaviors of 2-dimensional systems living on the spheres surrounding the black hole. There have <lb/>been some works on this kind of topic in the literature. In [13] the thermodynamic properties and the <lb/>Bose-Einstein condensations on stretched horizons are extensively studied. In [14] the thermodynamics <lb/>for quantum photons living on astrophysical spheres is constructed. We will still focus on the effect of <lb/>the curved space-time metric on the thermodynamics of the system and point out that the induced large <lb/> z always plays an important role in the derivation of a holographic screen. <lb/>The formulism above can be easily generalized to a 2-dimensional system living in a curved <lb/>space-time. Consider an idea gas of relativistic massless bosons confined in the system. The number of <lb/>quantum states with energy between w and w + dw will be <lb/> g(w)dw = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π)  2 <lb/>  √ γ  2  d <lb/> 2  x <lb/> 2πwdw <lb/>( <lb/> √ g  00  )  2  . <lb/> (12) <lb/>At the temperature T = 1/β, using the Bose-Einstein distribution, the energy of the system is <lb/> U = <lb/> w <lb/>e  βw  − 1 <lb/> g(w)dw <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/>(2π)  2 <lb/>  √ <lb/> γ  2  d <lb/> 2  x <lb/>w <lb/>e  βw  − 1 <lb/>2πwdw <lb/>( <lb/> √ g  00  )  2  , <lb/> = c  1  T <lb/> 3 <lb/>  √ γ  2 <lb/> g  00 <lb/> d <lb/> 2  x, <lb/> (13) <lb/></body>

			<body> where c  1  = ζ(3)/π  1.202/π. Notice the energy distribution <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  00 <lb/> w  2 <lb/> e  βw  −1 <lb/> dw was obtained in [14] by a <lb/>standard quantization procedure for the photons on spheres, which verifies the present formulism we <lb/>adopt. The corresponding entropy is <lb/> S = lnΞ + βU = − <lb/> ln(1 − e <lb/> −βw  )g(w)dw + βU <lb/> = c  2  T <lb/> 2 <lb/>  √ γ  2 <lb/> g  00 <lb/> d <lb/> 2  x, <lb/> (14) <lb/>where c  2  = 3ζ(3)/(2π)  1.803/π. <lb/> On the sphere of some radius R which surrounds the Schwarzschild black hole, the term g  00  (R) is <lb/>just a constant, so the formulae (13) and (14) can be directly calculated as <lb/> U = c  1  zA  R  T <lb/> 3  , S = c  2  zA  R  T <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (15) <lb/>with <lb/> A  R  = <lb/> √ γ  2  d <lb/> 2  x = <lb/> R <lb/> 2  sin θdθdϕ = 4πR <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (16) <lb/> z = 1/g  00  (R) = 1/(1 − <lb/> 2M <lb/> R <lb/> ). <lb/> (17) <lb/>Now A  R  is the volume of the 2-dimensional system and z reflects the effect of the curved space-time <lb/>metric. As in the 3-dimensional case, the emergence of z is a deduced result rather than an assumption. <lb/>When the sphere is far from the black hole, z → 1, we recover the conventional thermodynamics U = <lb/> c  1  A  R  T <lb/> 3  , S = c  2  A  R  T <lb/> 2  for a 2-dimensional bosonic gas in a flat space-time. In contrast, when the sphere <lb/>is located in a strong gravitational region close to the horizon of the black hole, we get a very large z in <lb/>Equation (15). <lb/>Here the purpose is to study the idea of holographic screen and see which sphere can be seen as the <lb/>holographic screen for the black hole. &quot; Holographic screen &quot; means all the information contained in the <lb/>bulk can be encoded on such a screen. Usually, one may prefer the event horizon at R  h  = 2M as the <lb/>holographic screen for the black hole. However, on the event horizon g  00  = 0 leads to an infinite state <lb/>density g(w)dw and further causes an embarrassing divergent thermodynamic behaviors according to <lb/>Equations (13) and (14). So we should use the stretched horizon, which is located at a Planck proper <lb/>distance away from the event horizon, as suggested in [11,13,15]. The concept of stretched horizon is a <lb/>useful idea in the discussion of black hole thermodynamics [16]. Because of quantum uncertainty, one <lb/>can not distinguish between a physical event on the stretched horizon and the one on the event horizon. <lb/>The radius R of the stretched horizon can be calculated from the requirement <lb/> l  p  = <lb/>  R <lb/>R  h <lb/> 1 <lb/> 1 − <lb/> 2M <lb/> r <lb/> dr  2 <lb/> R  h  (R − R  h  ). <lb/> (18) <lb/>It gives R = R  h  + l <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  /(4R  h  ). From Equation (17), there is z = 1/g  00  (R) = 4R <lb/> 2 <lb/> h  /l <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  on the stretched <lb/>horizon. If we require the corresponding 2-dimensional system has energy E = E  bh  ∼ R, the <lb/>thermodynamics (15) immediately leads to <lb/> T ∼ 1/R, S ∼ R <lb/> 2  , <lb/> (19) <lb/></body>

			<body> which captures the familiar scaling behaviors of the black hole thermodynamics. Thus the stretched <lb/>horizon can surely be taken as the holographic screen for the black hole and the DOFs of the black hole <lb/>can be viewed as living on the stretched horizon. Notice that the large z still plays an important role <lb/>in the derivation of the holographic screen. Besides, the locally measured temperature at the stretched <lb/>horizon is calculated as T  loc  = T / <lb/> g  00  (R) ∼ T  p  , which is of the order of the Planck temperature. It <lb/>justifies the choice of the location of the stretched horizon, because if we put the stretched horizon closer <lb/>to the black hole, we will get a higher locally measured temperature which is physically unacceptable. <lb/> 4. Conclusions <lb/> We have analyzed the thermodynamics of a system consisting of relativistic massless bosons which <lb/>lives in a static space-time. We find that a parameter z enters the formulae of energy and entropy <lb/>of the system, which includes certain effects of the curved space-time. When the system is in a flat <lb/>space-time, there is z = 1, then we retrieve the conventional thermodynamics. When the system is <lb/>in a strong gravitational region, z becomes a very large number. The non-trivial z greatly changes the <lb/>thermodynamic behaviors of the system and plays an essential role in the derivation of the holographic <lb/>entropy and holographic screen. Actually, our result indicates an important fact that, for two systems <lb/>with the same temperature T (from the point of view of a Killing observer), the system located in a more <lb/>curved space-time contains a larger entropy density. <lb/>Finally, we want to make two further comments. First, the thermodynamics (10) in a curved <lb/>space-time has been recast into the same form as the thermodynamics (1) with a large number of particle <lb/>species. It is tempting to give this a physical explanation, even though it is a vague one. As we have <lb/>shown in Equation (6), gravitational field expands the single-particle state space by a factor <lb/> √ γ/( <lb/> √ g  00  ) <lb/> 3  . <lb/>Roughly speaking, it implies that the microstates provide <lb/> √ γ/( <lb/> √ g  00  ) <lb/> 3  distinct &quot; copies &quot; or &quot; species &quot; for <lb/>the particles to occupy, compared to the situation in a flat space-time. Second, in order to reach the <lb/>holographic entropy in Equation (3), the number of particle species must be taken as L <lb/> 2  /l <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  . At the same <lb/>time, the total number of particles in the system is calculated as N = E  bh  /T ∼ L <lb/> 2  /l <lb/> 2 <lb/> p  . The two quantities <lb/>are of the same order of magnitude. This implies that all the particles are distinguishable from each <lb/>other by their species and this kind of model is equivalent to a model based on distinguishable particles. <lb/>In fact, it is aware very early that holographic thermodynamics can be derived from distinguishable <lb/>particles. Banks et al. have noticed that bosonic and fermionic systems do not have enough DOFs for <lb/>the holographic entropy and turn to construct a black hole model from Matrix theory which consists of <lb/>a Bolztmann gas of D0 branes [17,18]. Moreover, in loop quantum gravity, the holographic entropy <lb/>can be derived by counting the DOFs on the isolated horizon of a black hole, which consists of <lb/>horizon punctures pierced by the edges of spin network. In [19] these punctures are confirmed to be <lb/>distinguishable and the corresponding Gibbs paradox is analyzed. Moreover, it is proved in [20,21] that <lb/>infinite statistics (quantum Boltzmann statistics) saturates the holographic entropy bound. Our results <lb/>may shed light on the understanding of those works. It seems that gravitational field plays a role in <lb/>causing the particle distinguishability at least effectively and it is worthy of further study. <lb/></body>
