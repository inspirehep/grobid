			<body> Topological invariants are by now widely recognized as <lb/>a powerful tool to characterize different phases of mat-<lb/>ter; in particular they turn out to be useful in the clas-<lb/>sification of topological insulators. <lb/> 1,2  In the topological <lb/>insulator phase, solids are characterized by gapped bulk <lb/>bands but present gapless edge states that allow charge <lb/>or spin conductivity on the boundaries. The presence <lb/>of such gapless edge states is linked to the emergence of <lb/>non-vanishing topological invariants via a bulk-boundary <lb/>correspondence. <lb/> 3  This topological feature ensures the ro-<lb/>bustness of the edge states against disorder. <lb/> 4,5 <lb/> A two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with spin-orbit <lb/>coupling has been identified as a remarkable and paradig-<lb/>matic example of topological insulator. This system is <lb/>the prototype of the so-called Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) <lb/>system presenting a quantized spin-Hall conductance at <lb/>the boundaries. The topological nature of QSH insulators <lb/>is identified by a time-reversal (T ) -topological invari-<lb/>ant Z  2 <lb/>6–8  . In the same way as the Thouless-Kohmoto-<lb/>Nightingale-den Nijs <lb/> 9  (TKNN) topological invariant was <lb/>defined for the integer quantum Hall effect, the above <lb/> Z  2  invariant was defined for the topological insulator in <lb/>terms of band eigenvectors and, as such, only applies to <lb/>noninteracting systems. On the other hand, in the pres-<lb/>ence of electron-electron interaction, there are generaliza-<lb/>tions of the TKNN invariant based on twisted boundary <lb/>conditions <lb/> 10  and on many-body Green&apos;s functions, <lb/> 11–13 <lb/> and unlike the former, the latter construction can be <lb/>straightforwardly extended to the Z  2  invariant to clas-<lb/>sify interacting QSH systems. <lb/>The field of interacting topological insulators is at-<lb/>tracting growing interest (see Refs. 14 and 15 for recent <lb/>reviews on two-dimensional systems) and the definition <lb/>of theoretical and computational tools to evaluate topo-<lb/>logical invariants in the presence of e-e interaction is ex-<lb/>tremely timely. The approach that seems most promis-<lb/>ing is the one developed in Ref. 12 where it has been <lb/>demonstrated that topological invariants are determined <lb/>by the behaviour of the one-particle propagator at zero <lb/>frequency only; more precisely it has been shown that the <lb/>eigenvectors of the single particle Hamiltonian that yields <lb/>topological invariants for non-interacting systems, should <lb/>be replaced in the interacting case by the eigenvectors of <lb/>the operator G <lb/> −1  (k, ω) at ω = 0 and momentum k. The <lb/>extension of topological invariants to interacting systems <lb/>is in this sense straightforward, the only demanding task <lb/>remaining the determination of the dressed Green&apos;s func-<lb/>tion. This concept has been recently applied to identify <lb/>the topological character of heavy fermion mixed valence <lb/>compounds <lb/> 16–19  and of the half-filled honeycomb lattice <lb/>with an additional bond dimerization <lb/> 20  . <lb/>In recent years a new class of many-body approaches <lb/>has been developed to calculate the one-particle Green&apos;s <lb/>function of extended systems solving the many body <lb/>problem in a subsystem of finite size and embedding it <lb/>within an infinite medium. These methods gather un-<lb/>der the name of Quantum Cluster theories <lb/> 21  and in-<lb/>clude Cluster Perturbation Theory <lb/> 22,23  (CPT), Dynam-<lb/>ical Cluster Approach <lb/> 24  (DCA), Variational Cluser Ap-<lb/>proximation <lb/> 25  (VCA), Cellular Dynamical Mean Field <lb/>Theory <lb/> 26  (CDMFT). They have found an unified lan-<lb/>guage within the variational scheme based on the the Self <lb/>Energy Functional approach <lb/> 27  . These methods, with dif-<lb/>ferent degrees of accuracy, give access to non trivial many <lb/>body effects and have been applied both to model sys-<lb/>tems and to realistic solids <lb/> 28,29  . <lb/>In this paper we consider the Kane-Mele-Hubbard <lb/>model <lb/> 30–33  describing a 2-dimensional honeycomb lattice <lb/>with both local e-e interaction and spin-orbit coupling <lb/>and we adopt an approach based on CPT to determine <lb/>the one-particle propagator, the topological hamiltonian <lb/> G <lb/> −1  (k, ω = 0) and its eigenvectors. This allows us to <lb/></body>

			<body> identify a general procedure that can be extended to <lb/>any Quantum Cluster approach and to investigate how <lb/>Green&apos;s function-based topological invariants can be ef-<lb/>fectively calculated. <lb/>The paper is organized as follows: in section I we re-<lb/>call how topological invariants can be obtained in terms <lb/>of G <lb/> −1  (k, ω = 0). Section II describes how topological <lb/>invariants are obtained by CPT and section III reports <lb/>the results in terms of topological invariants and spectral <lb/>functions for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model of 2D and <lb/>1D honeycomb lattices. <lb/> I. TOPOLOGICAL HAMILTONIAN AND <lb/>TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANTS <lb/> In the search for an extension of topological invari-<lb/>ants from the non-interacting to the interacting case, <lb/>the Green&apos;s function has proved to be the fundamental <lb/>tool <lb/> 11–13,34  . As shown in Refs. 11 and 12 the dressed <lb/>one-particle Green&apos;s function at zero frequency contains <lb/>all the topological information that is required to cal-<lb/>culate topological invariants: the inverse of the Green&apos;s <lb/>function at zero frequency defines a fictitious noninter-<lb/>acting topological hamiltonian <lb/> 35 <lb/> h  topo  (k) ≡ −G <lb/> −1  (k, 0) <lb/>(1) <lb/>and its eigenvectors <lb/> h  topo  (k)|k, n, s =  ns  (k)|k, n, s <lb/> (2) <lb/>are the quantities to be used to compute the topologi-<lb/>cal invariants for the interacting system. Here n, s are <lb/>band and spin indices respectively (s =↑↓). The latter <lb/>is a good quantum number if –as in the model we study <lb/>below– the spin orbit interaction only involves the z com-<lb/>ponent of the spin. <lb/>Hence, we can take the time-reversal operator to be <lb/>Θ = I ⊗ iσ  y  K <lb/> where σ  y  acts on the spin indices, K denotes complex <lb/>conjugation and I is the identity for the sublattice indices. <lb/>The matrix <lb/> w  ns,n   s   (k) ≡ −k, n, s|Θ|k, n <lb/>  , s <lb/> (3) <lb/>is thus a block-diagonal matrix, and is antisymmetric at <lb/>time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) Γ  i  defined by <lb/>the condition that −Γ  i  = Γ  i  +G with G a reciprocal lattice <lb/>vector. The generalized Z  2  topological invariant can thus <lb/>be defined <lb/> 7,12  as the exponent ∆ in the expression <lb/>(−1) <lb/> ∆  ≡ <lb/> T RIM <lb/> det[w(Γ  i  )] <lb/>Pf[w(Γ  i  )] <lb/>(4) <lb/>and used to classify trivial insulators (∆ = 0, mod 2) <lb/>from topological QSH insulators (∆ = 1, mod 2). In <lb/>the presence of inversion symmetry this definition is even <lb/>simpler, involving just the parity eigenvalues η  n  (Γ  i  ) = <lb/> ±1 of the occupied bands at Γ  i  for any of the two spin <lb/>sectors <lb/>(−1) <lb/> ∆  = <lb/> T RIM <lb/>N <lb/> n=1 <lb/> η  n  (Γ  i  ) . <lb/> (5) <lb/>The definition of Z  2  for an interacting system is thus <lb/>formally identical to the non-interacting case, involving <lb/>in both cases the eigenstates of a single particle hamilto-<lb/>nian; in the presence of e-e interaction the difficult task <lb/>remains the calculation of the topological hamiltonian in <lb/>terms of the interacting Green&apos;s function. In the next <lb/>section we will describe how this can be done within the <lb/>CPT paradigm. <lb/> II. KANE-MELE-HUBBARD MODEL AND CPT <lb/> We are interested in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model for <lb/>a 2D honeycomb lattice <lb/>ˆ <lb/> H = <lb/> il,i   l   s <lb/> t  il,i   l   (s)ˆ c <lb/>  † <lb/> ils  <lb/>  i   l   s  + U <lb/> il <lb/>î <lb/> c <lb/>  † <lb/> il↑  <lb/>  il↑  <lb/>  † <lb/> il↓  <lb/>  il↓  . (6) <lb/>The hopping term t  il,i   l   (s) includes both the first-<lb/>neighbor spin-independent hopping and the Haldane-<lb/>Kane-Mele second-neighbor spin-orbit coupling <lb/> 6,36  given <lb/>by ıt  KM  s  z  (d  1  × d  2  )  z  , where d  1  and d  2  are unit vectors <lb/>along the two bonds that connect site il with site i <lb/>  l <lb/>  . <lb/>Here i, i <lb/>  run over the M atomic positions within the unit <lb/>cell (cluster) and l, l <lb/>  refer to lattice vectors identifying <lb/>the unit cells of the lattice. The on-site e-e repulsion is <lb/>described by the U -Hubbard term. <lb/>In order to solve the eigenvalue problem (2), in strict <lb/>analogy with what is done in any standard Tight-Binding <lb/>scheme for non-interacting hamiltonians, a Bloch basis <lb/>expression of the topological hamiltonian, namely of the <lb/>dressed Green&apos;s function and of its inverse, is required <lb/> G  ij  (k, ω) = Ψ  0  |ˆ  <lb/>  † <lb/> ki <lb/>î <lb/> Gˆ  kj  |Ψ  0  + Ψ  0  |ˆ   ki î <lb/> Gˆ <lb/>  † <lb/> kj  |Ψ  0  (7) <lb/>wherê <lb/> G = <lb/> 1 <lb/> ω−  <lb/> and <lb/>ˆ <lb/> c <lb/>  † <lb/> ki  = <lb/>1 <lb/> √ <lb/> L <lb/> L <lb/> l <lb/> e <lb/> −ik·(R  l  +ri)  ˆ <lb/> c <lb/>  † <lb/> li  ; ˆ <lb/> c  ki  = <lb/>1 <lb/> √ <lb/> L <lb/> L <lb/> l <lb/> e <lb/> ik·(R  l  +ri)  ˆ <lb/> c  li <lb/> with R  l  the lattice vectors (L → ∞) and r  i  the atomic <lb/>positions inside the unit cell. (These relations hold in any <lb/>spin sector and we have therefore intentionally omitted <lb/>the spin index). <lb/>In the following we will adopt a many body technique <lb/>to calculate the one-particle dressed Green&apos;s function <lb/>based on the CPT <lb/> 22,23  . This method shares with other <lb/>Quantum Cluster formalisms the basic idea of approx-<lb/>imating the effects of correlations in the infinite lattice <lb/>with those on a finite-size cluster.

			<body> Cluster approaches differ for the strategy adopted to em-<lb/>bed the cluster in the continuum and to express the lat-<lb/>tice Green&apos;s function –or the corresponding self-energy– <lb/>in terms of the cluster one. The common starting point is <lb/>the choice of the M -site cluster used to tile the extended <lb/>lattice. <lb/>In CPT the Green&apos;s function (7) for the extended lat-<lb/>tice is calculated by solving the equation <lb/> G  ij  (k, ω) = G <lb/> c <lb/>ij  (ω) + <lb/> M <lb/> i  <lb/> B  ii   (k, ω)G  i   j  (k, ω). <lb/> (8) <lb/>Here G <lb/> c <lb/>ij  is the cluster Green&apos;s function in the local ba-<lb/>sis obtained by exact diagonalization of the interacting <lb/>hamiltonian for the finite cluster; we separately solve the <lb/>problem for N, N-1 and N+1 electrons and express the <lb/>cluster Green&apos;s function in the Lehmann representation <lb/>at real frequencies. The matrix B  ii   (k, ω) is given by <lb/> B  ii   (k, ω) = <lb/> L <lb/> l <lb/> e <lb/> ik·R  l <lb/> M <lb/> i  <lb/> G <lb/> c <lb/>ii   (ω)t  i   0,i   l  (s) <lb/>where t  i   0,i   l  is the hopping term between site i <lb/>  and i <lb/> belonging to different clusters. <lb/>Eq. (8) is solved by a M × M matrix inversion at <lb/>each k and ω. A second M × M matrix inversion is <lb/>needed to obtain the topological hamiltonian according <lb/>to eq. (1). The diagonalization of the topological hamil-<lb/>tonian is then required to obtain the eigenvectors to be <lb/>used for the calculation of Z  2  according to (5). It is worth <lb/>recalling that the eigenvalues of h  topo  in principle have <lb/>nothing to do with the quasi-particle excitation energies: <lb/>only the topological information is encoded in G  ij  (k, 0), <lb/>but the full Green&apos;s function is needed to calculate quasi-<lb/>particle spectral functions <lb/> A(k, ω) = <lb/>1 <lb/> π <lb/> n <lb/> Im G(k, n, ω) <lb/> (9) <lb/>where <lb/> G(k, n, ω) = <lb/>1 <lb/> M <lb/> ii  <lb/> e <lb/> −ik·(ri−r  i  )  α <lb/> n * <lb/>i  (k)α <lb/> n <lb/>i   (k)G  ii   (k, ω) <lb/> with n the band index and α <lb/> n <lb/>i  (k) the eigenstate coeffi-<lb/>cients obtained by the single-particle band calculation. <lb/> 29 <lb/> In the next section, analyzing in the detail all the in-<lb/>formation that can be deduced from the explicit calcu-<lb/>lation of the interacting Green&apos;s function, we will also <lb/>be able to investigate more closely the relations between <lb/>the eigenstates of the topological hamiltonian and the <lb/>quasi-particle energies. <lb/> III. RESULTS <lb/> We have used the CPT formalism to calculate the <lb/>dressed Green&apos;s function of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard <lb/>model spanning a whole set of spin-orbit couplings t  KM <lb/> and U parameters. For the 2D honeycomb lattice the <lb/>6-site cluster (Fig. 1 (a)) commonly used in Quantum <lb/>Cluster calculations <lb/> 37–40  has been adopted. In order to <lb/>check the role of cluster size and geometry we have also <lb/>considered the 8-site cluster of Fig. 1 (b). Both clusters <lb/>represent a tiling for the honeycomb lattice but with very <lb/>different cluster symmetries. Obviously this has no influ-<lb/>ence in the non-interacting case where either the &quot; natu-<lb/>ral &quot; 2-site unit cell or any larger unit cell (4, 6, 8 sites <lb/>etc.) produce the same band structure. This is no more <lb/>so if the e-e interaction is switched on: in any Quantum <lb/>Cluster approach where the extended system is described <lb/>as a periodic repetition of correlated units, the transla-<lb/>tion periodicity is only partially restored (it is preserved <lb/>only at the superlattice level). This inevitably affects <lb/>the quasi-particle band structure and for the 8-site tiling <lb/>gives rise to a wrong k-dispersion. This appears quite <lb/>clearly by comparing spectral functions (cfr. eq. (9)) ob-<lb/>tained with 6-site and 8-site tilings at k-points along the <lb/>border of the 2D Brillouine zone. In particular, for the <lb/>6-site tiling the quasi-particle energies display the cor-<lb/>rect symmetry, and energies at any k-point and its ro-<lb/>tated counterpart— <lb/> − <lb/>→ <lb/> k and R <lb/> − <lb/>→ <lb/> k , with R a point group <lb/>rotation—coincide (see fig. 2 (a), (c) ). This well-known <lb/>basic rule is violated for the 8-site tiling and the quasi-<lb/>particle energies at K, K <lb/>  do not coincide with the val-<lb/>ues at K <lb/>  and K <lb/>  (see fig. 2 (b), (d) ). Indeed the gap <lb/>closes down around K <lb/>  and K <lb/>  but not at K and K <lb/>  . <lb/>This is due to the fact that the 8-site tiling has a pre-<lb/>ferred direction so that the dispersions along K − K <lb/>  and <lb/> K <lb/>  − K <lb/>  are different. <lb/>The dependence on the cluster&apos;s size and symmetry <lb/>of the quasiparticle band dispersion in the Kane-Mele-<lb/>Hubbard model is shown here for the first time and ap-<lb/>pears to be crucial in order to identify the accuracy and <lb/>appropriateness of the results: any band structure of a <lb/>non-interacting system violating the point group symme-<lb/>tries should be disregarded as wrong and unphysical; the <lb/>same should be done for interacting systems since e-e re-<lb/>pulsion does not affect the lattice point group symmetry. <lb/>For this reason the semimetal behaviour for t  KM  = 0 and <lb/> U/t ≤ 3.5 that we find for the 8-site tiling in agreement <lb/>with Refs. 38 and 43 should be considered an artifact <lb/>due to the wrong cluster symmetry and not to be used <lb/>to infer any real behaviour of the model system. Only <lb/>clusters that preserve the point group symmetries of the <lb/>lattice should be used <lb/> 21  and this criterion restricts the <lb/>choice for the 2D honeycomb lattice to the 6-site clus-<lb/>ter. <lb/> 41  . These considerations are quite general and quasi-<lb/>particle states, topological invariants and phase diagrams <lb/>obtained by Quantum Cluster approaches using tilings <lb/>with the wrong symmetry (2-, 4-, 8-site clusters) <lb/> 38,42,43 <lb/> are for this reason not reliable. <lb/>We focus now on the Green&apos;s function at ω = 0 and <lb/>on the topological properties that can be deduced from <lb/>it. As discussed in the previous section, the key quantity <lb/>is the dressed Green&apos;s function expressed in a Bloch ba-<lb/></body>

Panel (a) and (b) ( (c) and (d) ) show <lb/>the results obtained with tKM /t = 0 ( tKM /t = 0.1) for 6-site <lb/>and 8-site tiling respectively. Notice that the gapless band <lb/>structure obtained for tKM /t = 0 with the 8-site tiling is a <lb/>consequence of a band dispersion that violates the rotational <lb/>symmetry of the lattice. <lb/> sis (eqs. (7) and (8)) and the corresponding topological <lb/>hamiltonian (h  topo  )  ij  = −G <lb/> −1 <lb/> ij  (k, ω = 0). The eigenvalue <lb/>problem associated to h  topo  –a 6 × 6 matrix diagonaliza-<lb/>tion at each k-point– is equivalent to a standard single <lb/>particle Tight-Binding calculation for a unit cell contain-<lb/>ing 6 atomic sites, giving rise to 6 topological bands. The <lb/>product over the first 3 occupied bands at the TRIM <lb/>points corresponding to the 6-site cluster provides, ac-<lb/>cording to eq. (5), the Z  2  invariant. Fig. 3 reports the <lb/>resulting U − t  KM  phase diagram showing the parameter <lb/>range where the system behaves as either a topologically <lb/>trivial insulator (TTI, ∆ = 0) or a Quantum Spin Hall <lb/>insulator (QSH, ∆ = 1) <lb/> 44  . <lb/>Few comments are in order: since we are monitoring <lb/>the topological phase transition by the Z  2  invariant, we <lb/>are implicitly assuming both time reversal and parity in-<lb/>variance and an adiabatic connection between QSH and <lb/>TTI phase to persist in all regimes. Anti-ferromagnetism <lb/>that breaks both time-reversal and sublattice inversion <lb/>symmetry is therefore excluded and we are assuming the <lb/>system to remain non-magnetic at any U . In this sense <lb/>the value of Z  2  can be considered an indicator of the <lb/>topological properties of the system of interest only for a <lb/>parameter range that excludes antiferromagnetism. <lb/>The behavior for t  KM  close to zero is worth noticing. <lb/>According to our CPT calculation, at low t  KM  the QSH <lb/>regime does not survive the switching on of e-e inter-<lb/>action: a value U → 0 is enough to destroy the semi-<lb/>metallic behavior at t  KM  = 0; see Fig. 4. This is at <lb/>variance with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results <lb/> 45,46 <lb/> that at t  KM  = 0 identify a semimetallic behavior up to <lb/> U/t ∼ 3.5 <lb/> 47  . It has been recently shown <lb/> 48  that the exis-<lb/>tence at t  KM  = 0 of an excitation gap down to U → 0 <lb/>is characteristic of all Quantum Cluster schemes with <lb/>the only exception of DCA. This is due to the afore-<lb/>mentioned violation of translational symmetry in Quan-<lb/>tum Cluster methods such as CPT, VCA and CDMFT, <lb/>regardless of the scheme being variational or not, and in-<lb/>dependent on the details of the specific implementations <lb/>(different impurity solvers, different temperatures). We <lb/>stress here again that the semimetal behaviour that is <lb/>found for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model by Quantum <lb/>Cluster approaches such as CDMFT <lb/> 38  and VCA <lb/> 43  is <lb/>actually an artifact due to the choice of clusters with <lb/>wrong symmetry. The only Quantum Cluster approach <lb/>that is able to reproduce a semimetal behaviour at finite <lb/> U is DCA. DCA preserves translation symmetry and has <lb/>been shown to describe better the small U regime; it be-<lb/>comes however less accurate at large U values where it <lb/>overemphasizes the semimetallic behavior of the honey-<lb/>comb lattice. <lb/> 48  In this sense DCA and the other Quantum <lb/>Cluster approaches can be considered as complementary <lb/>and it would be interesting to compare their results also <lb/>in terms of parity invariants. <lb/>By calculating spectral functions in the same param-<lb/>eter range we observe that at the transition points the <lb/>single particle excitation gap ∆  sp  , namely the minimum <lb/>energy separation between hole and particle excitations, <lb/>closes down. The possibility for e-e interaction to induce <lb/>a metallic behavior in a band insulator has been recently <lb/>analysed by DMFT <lb/> 49,50  and QMC calculations <lb/> 51  ; here <lb/>we observe that, in agreement with previous results <lb/> 37,38  , <lb/>the same effect occurs in the honeycomb lattice made <lb/>semiconducting by intrinsic spin-orbit interaction. Fig. <lb/>4 shows the behavior of ∆  sp  at different values of t  KM  /t <lb/> as a function of U/t. Fig. 5 (a-c) shows as an example the <lb/>quasi-particle band structure obtained for t  KM  /t = 0.1 <lb/>and for U/t = 2 (QSH regime), U/t = 3.5 (transi-<lb/>tion point from QSH to TTI, the gap closes down) and <lb/> U/t = 4 (TTI regime). <lb/>Other effects are due to the e-e correlation, namely <lb/>a band width reduction and the appearance of satel-<lb/>lite structures below (above) valence (conduction) band. <lb/>These effects are more clearly seen by looking at the den-<lb/>sity of states (DOS) obtained as the sum of the spectral <lb/>functions over a large sample of k-points (Fig. 6). <lb/>Even if the eigenvalues of h  topo  cannot be identified <lb/>with excitation energies, they exhibit a behavior simi-<lb/>lar to the quasi-particle energies. In particular the same <lb/>gap closure appears in h  topo  eigenvalues at the transition <lb/></body>

The ribbon width corresponds to 30 sites <lb/>per cell. <lb/> In conclusion we have studied the topological proper-<lb/>ties of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model by explicitly calcu-<lb/>lating the Green&apos;s function-based topological invariant. <lb/>The CPT scheme, using Bloch sums as a basis set, nat-<lb/>urally leads to the topological hamiltonian matrix that <lb/>enters in the computation of the Z  2  topological invariant. <lb/>The approach gives direct access to the dressed Green&apos;s <lb/>function at real frequencies, avoiding the problem of ana-<lb/>lytic continuation, and does not require the extraction of <lb/>a self-energy. We have shown that the interplay between <lb/>the Hubbard interaction and the intrinsic spin-orbit cou-<lb/>pling is coherently described by the values of Z  2  invariant <lb/>and by 2D and 1D quasi-particle energies (gap closing at <lb/>the transitions, edge states in the QSH phase). We have <lb/>discussed the importance of the cluster symmetry and <lb/>the effects of the lack of full translation symmetry typ-<lb/>ical of CPT and of most Quantum Cluster approaches. <lb/>Comments on the limits of applicability of the method <lb/>are also provided. <lb/></body>
