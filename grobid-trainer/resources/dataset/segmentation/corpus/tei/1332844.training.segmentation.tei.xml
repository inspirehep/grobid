			<front> REVIEW OF CROSSTALK BETWEEN BEAM-BEAM INTERACTION <lb/>AND LATTICE NONLINEARITY IN  +  −  COLLIDERS  * <lb/> Y. Zhang <lb/>  † <lb/> , IHEP, Beijing, China; D. Zhou, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan <lb/> Abstract <lb/> According to the conventional knowledge, it is believed <lb/>that the nonlinearity in the arc would not reduce the beam-<lb/>beam performance, since the beam-beam force is dominated <lb/>in the beam core region while the lattice nonlinearity is dom-<lb/>inated in the beam halo region. However in the recent few <lb/> +  −  storage ring colliders, it has been shown that the lat-<lb/>tice nonlinearity may be important to the luminosity perfor-<lb/>mance. In this paper, we&apos;ll try to review the related story <lb/>in DAFNE, and its upgrade with crab waist scheme, KEKB, <lb/>Super-KEKB and BEPCII. <lb/></front>

			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> The luminosity performance of a collider may be affected <lb/>by many factors, such as linear optics parameters, emittance <lb/>coupling and collective instability. <lb/>As a conventional view, the beam-beam performance has <lb/>nothing to do with the nonlinearity in the arc, since the <lb/>beam-beam force is dominated in the beam core region <lb/>while the lattice nonlinarity is dominated in the beam halo <lb/>region. When we talk about this, it is usually assumed that <lb/>the dyanmic aperture is much larger than the beam size. The <lb/>assumption is usually true. With the increase of peak lumi-<lb/>nosity of a machine, we&apos;ve to squeeze the í»½ function at IP. <lb/>This has bring a lot of problems and make the design of <lb/>such a machine harder and harder. One of the consequence <lb/>is that the dynamic aperture is very hard to enlarge and beam <lb/>lifetime is very critical. In this case, the nonlinearity maybe <lb/>harmful to the luminosity. <lb/>When we talk about the chromaticity, we usually refer <lb/>to the tune chromacitiy. For a collider, we also care the <lb/>the twiss parameters versus the momentum, especially at <lb/>IP. The linear chromatic distortion could be represeted by <lb/>the so-called W-paramters. These momentum depedent op-<lb/>tics distortion including the higher order terms, could excite <lb/>the synchro-betatron resonances and reduce the beam-beam <lb/>performance. <lb/>The recent electron-positron storage ring colliders are all <lb/>high energy machines and run above transistion. The nat-<lb/>ural negative tune chromaticity needs to be corrected to <lb/>a small positive value, where the sextupoles are used and <lb/>the nonlinear elements are included. The fringe field of a <lb/>magnet may also contribute a nonlinear magnetic field even <lb/>without sextupole or octupoles. <lb/>In the recent decades, there exist some experience in dif-<lb/>ferent machines on the crosstalk between beam-beam and <lb/></body>

			<body> lattice nonlinerity. We try to summarize the work, but not <lb/>try to tell all the story in the paper. <lb/> EXPERIENCES OF MACHINES <lb/> DAΦNE [1] <lb/> DAΦNE is a low energy (∼ 0.5GeV) lepton collider. It <lb/>started operation in May 1999. We focus its early commis-<lb/>sioning before 2002. <lb/>Three main techniques were adopted for the nonlinear dy-<lb/>namics : tune scans, localized orbit bumps inside critical <lb/>magnetic elements and beam decoherence measurements. <lb/>The tune scan was used to define safe areas for beam-beam <lb/>collisions on the tune diagram not affected by nonlinear lat-<lb/>tice resonances. By changing the tunes, the lifetime and <lb/>blow up of a single bunch at the synchrotron light moni-<lb/>tor is observed. It is found that for some tunes the lifetime <lb/>was strongly reduced or the beam size increased. It is found <lb/>that nonlinear resonances up to 6th order were responsible <lb/>for these effects by analyzing the results. Since such res-<lb/>onances can be driven only by strong nonlinear magnetic <lb/>elements, dedicated orbit bumps were performed and tune <lb/>shifts versus bump amplitude were measured in order to rec-<lb/>ognize such elements. In particular, it was found that the <lb/>wigglers are a strong source of octupole-like terms provid-<lb/>ing a cubic nonlinearity [2]. Then the beam decoherence <lb/>was directly measured and the the coefficient  11  of the hor-<lb/>izontal tune shift versus amplitude was estimated. Numeri-<lb/>cal simulations carried out taking into account the measured <lb/>cubic nonlinearity have shown that they have a dramatic im-<lb/>pact on the collider luminosity performance [3]. Beam blow <lb/>up and tails growth could be observed in the simulations <lb/>if the coefficient || 11 | characterizing the cubic nonlinearity <lb/>exceeded 200 m  −1  . The value is as high as 600 m  −1  for <lb/>some lattice configurations . In the multibunch regime the <lb/>maximum achievable luminosity is mainly limited by the <lb/>combined effect of parasitic crossings and nonlinearities. <lb/>Experimentally, a strong correlation between the lumi-<lb/>nosity and the measured cubic nonlinearity was observed. <lb/>Indeed, the peak luminosity of 5.2 × 10 31  cm  −2  s  −1  at that <lb/>time was obtained when || 11 | was reduced below 200 m  −1 <lb/> in both rings. In this case the luminosity scales linearly with <lb/>the number of bunches. <lb/>The beam-beam experience obtained in DAΦNE proved <lb/>the importance of the machine cubic nonlinearity control <lb/>and demonstrated that the cubic nonlinearity tuning may <lb/>lead to substantial gain in luminosity and beam-beam per-<lb/>formance. <lb/></body>

			 <body> DAΦNE with crab waist [4] <lb/>  In high luminosity colliders with conventional collision <lb/>schemes the key requirements to increase the luminosity <lb/>are: very small vertical beta function í»½  í±¦  at the interaction <lb/>point (IP), high beam intensity and large horizontal emit-<lb/>tance í¼ í±¥  and beam size í¼ í±¥  . However, í»½ í±¦  cannot be much <lb/>smaller than the longitudinal rms bunch size (bunch length) <lb/> í¼ í± §  without incurring the &quot; hour-glass &quot; effect. Unfortunately, <lb/>it is very difficult to shorten the bunch in a high current ring <lb/>without exciting collective instabilities. Even then, the large <lb/>beam current may result in high power losses, beam insta-<lb/>bilities and dramatic increase of the wallplug power. These <lb/>problems can be overcome with the recently proposed crab-<lb/>waist (CW) scheme of beambeam collisions [5, 6] , where <lb/>a substantial luminosity increase can be achieved without <lb/>bunch length reduction and with moderate beam currents. <lb/>The CW scheme(see Fig. 1 can substantially increase col-<lb/>lider luminosity since it combines several potentially advan-<lb/>tageous ideas: collisions with a large Piwinski angle, micro-<lb/>beta insertions and suppression of beambeam resonances <lb/>using dedicated ( &quot; crab waist &quot; ) sextupoles. <lb/>Figure 1: Crab-waist collision scheme. The color straight <lb/>lines show directions of motion for particles with different <lb/>horizontal deviations from the central orbit. The arrows in-<lb/>dicate the corresponding í»½ function variations along these <lb/>trajectories. <lb/>The CW vertical í»½ function rotation is provided by sex-<lb/>tupole magnets placed on both sides of the IP in phase with <lb/>the IP in the horizontal plane and at í¼/2 in the vertical one <lb/>(as shown in Fig. 2). The crab sextupole strength should <lb/>satisfy the following condition depending on the crossing <lb/>angle and the í»½ functions at the interaction point (IP) (indi-<lb/>cated with an asterisk) and the sextupole locations: <lb/> í°¾ = <lb/>1 <lb/>í¼ <lb/>1 <lb/>í»½  * <lb/>í±¦ í»½ í±¦ <lb/> √ <lb/>í»½  * <lb/>í±¥ <lb/> í»½ í±¥ <lb/> (1) <lb/>The one-turn map could be represented as follows, <lb/> exp(∶ −−í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ ∶) exp(∶ í°» í±í± ∶) exp(∶ í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ ∶) exp(∶ í°» í±í±í± ∶) <lb/> (2) <lb/>The pure lattice one-turn map at IP without beam-beam in-<lb/>teraction could be represented as <lb/> exp(∶ í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ ∶) exp(∶ í°» í±í±í± ∶) exp(∶ −−í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ ∶) <lb/> (3) <lb/>Figure 2: Crab sextupole locations. <lb/>In order to do the normal form analysis, the one-turn map <lb/>could be rewritten in the format like this <lb/> exp ∶í± 2 (í±)∶ exp ∶í± 3 (í±)∶ exp ∶í± 4 (í±)∶ <lb/> (4) <lb/>where  2  represent the linear map, and <lb/> 3 = (cos í¼ í±¥ − sin í¼ í±¥ í± í±¥ )(sin í¼ í±¦ + cos í¼ í±¦ í± í±¦ ) 2 − í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ <lb/> (5) <lb/> 4 = − <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>∶ exp ∶−í± 2 (í±)∶ í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ ∶ í± 2 <lb/>í±¦ <lb/> (6) <lb/>with ≡ <lb/> í±√í»½ í±¥ <lb/> í»½ í±¦ <lb/> . Then it is easily to obtain the generating <lb/>function at IP. And one could check the lattice if the crab-<lb/>waist transformation is good enough for on/off-momentum <lb/>particles using MADX/PTC for example. <lb/>Fig. 3 demonstrates the resonances suppression applying <lb/>the frequency map analysis (FMA) for the beam-beam in-<lb/>teraction in CW collisions [7]. It shows the beam-beam <lb/>footprint for DAΦNE with CW sextupoles off (left) and on <lb/>(right). <lb/>Figure 3: Beam-beam footprint with crab sextupoles off <lb/>(left) and on (right) obtained by FMA techniques [7] <lb/>The CW scheme has been successfully tested at the <lb/>electron-positron collider DAΦNE. After an upgrade in-<lb/>cluding the implementation of this novel collision scheme, <lb/>the specific luminosity at low beam currents has been <lb/>boosted by more than a factor of 4, while the present peak <lb/>luminosity, 4.53x1032 cm-2s-1, is a factor of 3 higher than <lb/>the maximum value obtained with the original configura-<lb/>tion based on the standard collision scheme [4]. <lb/>The success of cw scheme shows us that the nonlinear-<lb/>ity may also contribute to the beam-beam performance and <lb/>help us increase the luminosity. <lb/> KEKB [9–12] <lb/> KEKB B-Factory has been operating at KEK since 1999 <lb/>for the e+e-collision experiment mainly at the Υ(4S) reso-<lb/></body>

			<body> nance. The highest luminosity (without crab cavity), 1.72 × <lb/>10 34 í± −2 í± −1  , was achieved in Nov. 2006. The peak lu-<lb/>minosity is higher than the design by 70% mainly due to <lb/>smaller í»½  * <lb/>í±¦  (6 mm vs. 10 mm), horizontal betatron tune <lb/>closer to a half integer (LER:0.505 / HER:0.511 vs. 0.52), <lb/>and higher stored current in the HER (1.35 A vs. 1.1 A). <lb/>One of the main design features of KEKB is the horizon-<lb/>tal crossing angle of 22 mrad at IP. Although there are many <lb/>merits in the crossing angle scheme, the beam-beam perfor-<lb/>mance may degrade. Beam-beam simulations showed that <lb/>the crab crossing is expected to boost the luminosity by a <lb/>factor of 2 [13]. The commissioning of KEKB with crab <lb/>cavities began in February 2007. However, the luminosity <lb/>is lower than that predicted at high beam currents at the be-<lb/>ginning [9]. <lb/>The existence of the chromatic x-y coupling was known <lb/>by a measurement of the synchro-beta sideband in the beam <lb/>size on the x-y tune space [14]. Simulations including the <lb/>chromatic coupling has been performed using a symplec-<lb/>tic integration method of the chromaticity [11].

It was found that the chromatic X-Y couplings are not <lb/>small enough and can affect the luminosity at the present <lb/>KEKB work point at around (44.515, 41.606) [11]. When <lb/>chromaticity of one ring in ideal optics is considered in sim-<lb/>ulations, results of weak-strong simulations show that the <lb/>luminosity degradation is around 5%. Further results of <lb/>strong-strong simulations show that the luminosity may de-<lb/>crease by around 10% and that the decrease depends slightly <lb/>on bunch currents. <lb/>Since skew sextupoles can be used to control the chro-<lb/>matic X-Y couplings, in the end of 2008, it was decided <lb/>that skew sextupoles should be installed at both the HER <lb/>and the LER. Tuning with skew sextupoles was commenced <lb/>from May 2, 2009, at KEKB. Since then, beam operation <lb/>at KEKB has been very successful and the chromatic X-Y <lb/>couplings at the IP have been reduced dramatically [8]. The <lb/>corresponding luminosity gain was above 15% [10], and the <lb/>peak luminosity exceeded 2 × 10 34 í± −2 í± −1  , which is twice <lb/>the designed value. <lb/>The story is the success of simulation.

To achieve such high lumi-<lb/>nosity, the SuperKEKB interaction region (IR) is designed <lb/>for large Piwinski angle collision scheme so called &quot; nano-<lb/>beam scheme &quot; . For the nano-beam scheme, the beta func-<lb/>tions at the interaction point (IP) are designed to 32mm / <lb/>270í¼m(horizontal/vertical) for the low energy positron ring <lb/></body>

In order to realize 1/20 times smaller <lb/>beta function at the IP than that achieved by the KEKB B-<lb/>factory, the SuperKEKB IR is designed to use both super-<lb/>conducting quadrupole doublets for final focus and hori-<lb/>zontal/vertical local chromaticity correctors for compensat-<lb/>ing large natural chromaticity. The dynamic aperture is re-<lb/>stricted by strong nonlinearities of final focus magnets. <lb/>The luminosity performance as a function of bunch cur-<lb/>rent products are shown in Fig. 5 [16]. In the figure, the red <lb/>solid lines indicate results of using pure weak-strong model. <lb/>The blue dashed lines indicates results of using pure weak-<lb/>strong model plus perturbations of chromatic aberrations. <lb/>The green dashed lines indicates results of using SAD code <lb/>with weak-strong model. The cyan lines represent the de-<lb/>sign values of luminosity and beam current products. It <lb/>is seen that significant loss of luminosity appears at high <lb/>bunch currents due to interplay of BB and LN in the LER. <lb/>Especially, the specific luminosity drops quickly at very low <lb/>beam currents. These phenomena can not be explained by <lb/>the momentum-dependent LN. The luminosity loss due to <lb/>interplay of BB and LN in the HER is not as serious as in <lb/>the LER, and can be well attributed to the chromatic aber-<lb/>rations in the HER lattice. <lb/> 0 <lb/> 0.5 <lb/>1 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>2 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>2 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>Specific Lum.

There exist some difference <lb/>for the dispersion function in the arc and the chromaticity is <lb/>also changed, see Fig. 8 for í»¼  í±¥  at IP. According to the sim-<lb/>ulation, the luminsoity loss is about 15% due to the model, <lb/>see Fig. 9.
