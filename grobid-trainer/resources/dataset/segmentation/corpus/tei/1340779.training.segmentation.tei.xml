			<front> KP hierarchy for Hodge integrals <lb/> M. Kazarian <lb/> Abstract <lb/> Starting from the ELSV formula, we derive a number of new equations on the <lb/>generating functions for Hodge integrals over the moduli space of complex curves. This <lb/>gives a new simple and uniform treatment of certain known results on Hodge integrals <lb/>like Witten&apos;s conjecture, Virasoro constrains, Faber&apos;s λ  g  -conjecture etc. Among other <lb/>results we show that a properly arranged generating function for Hodge integrals satisfies <lb/>the equations of the KP hierarchy. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> By Hodge integrals we mean intersection numbers of the form <lb/> λ  j  τ  k  1  . . . τ  kn  = <lb/> Mg,n <lb/> λ  j  ψ <lb/> k  1 <lb/> 1  . . . ψ <lb/> kn <lb/>n  , <lb/> where M  g,n  is the moduli space of complex stable curves with n ordered marked points, ψ  i <lb/> is the first Chern class of the line bundle over M  g,n  formed by the cotangent lines at the <lb/> ith marked point and λ  j  is the jth Chern class of the rank g Hodge vector bundle whose <lb/>fibers are the spaces of holomorphic one-forms. These numbers are well defined whenever <lb/>the equality j + <lb/> k  i  = 3g − 3 + n(= dim M  g,n  ) holds. They play an important role in <lb/>various problems related to the Gromov-Witten theory. <lb/>There are several approaches to intersection theory on moduli spaces. Among those <lb/>approaches the one that seems to be the most simple and the most straightforward is that <lb/>based on the Ekedahl-Lando-Shapiro-Vainshtein (ELSV) formula [ELSV]. This formula <lb/>expresses Hurwitz numbers enumerating ramified coverings of the sphere as linear com-<lb/>binations of Hodge integrals. The ELSV formula can be inverted in order to get some <lb/>information about Hodge integrals from known facts about Hurwitz numbers. <lb/>The ELSV formula was applied successfully in many papers, see, e.g. [OP], [KL], [GJV2], <lb/>[CLL], [SZ]. In this note, we undertake a revision of the methods developed in those papers. <lb/>One of our main goals is to give a complete and clear description of the relationship between <lb/>various known equations for Hurwitz numbers on one side and Hodge integrals on the other <lb/>side: equations of integrable hierarchies, the cut-and-join equation, Virasoro constrains, <lb/> λ  g  -conjecture etc. <lb/>The method used in the present paper is close to that of [KL]. The main difference is in <lb/>a new change of variables inverting the ELSV formula. The advantage of the new change <lb/>is that it induces an automorphism of the KP hierarchy. This permits one to derive the <lb/>whole hierarchy of PDE&apos;s at once for the generating function of Hodge integrals, and, as a <lb/>consequence, for the Witten&apos;s potential participating in his conjecture. <lb/>The change of variables explored in the present paper is motivated by that of Goulden-<lb/>Jackson-Vakil used in [GJV2] in their proof of the λ  g  -conjecture and also in the paper [CLL] <lb/></body>

			<body> devoted to the new derivation of the Virasoro constrains for intersection numbers of ψ <lb/> classes. In both papers the GJV change is done via the so called symmetrization operation. <lb/>The symmetrization is used as an intermediate step of computations and is not used in the <lb/>formulation of the final result. It is natural, therefore, to try to skip the symmetrization <lb/>operation and to apply the GJV change directly to the original generating function. The <lb/>main difficulty appearing in this approach is technical: one has to make a change of variables <lb/>in a differential operator containing infinitely many summands and involving infinitely many <lb/>variables. To overcome this difficulty, we apply here the machinery of the boson-fermion <lb/>correspondence. It allows one to reduce the manipulation with differential operators in <lb/>an infinite dimensional space to those in just one variable and containing finitely many <lb/>terms. This makes all computations quite elementary and free of combinatorial difficulties <lb/>(no infinite sums are involved). <lb/>I would like to thank my colleague S. Lando and all participants of our joint seminar <lb/>at the Independent University of Moscow where the preliminary version of the presented <lb/>theory was intensively discussed. <lb/> 2 Main results <lb/> Let us collect Hodge integrals into the following formal series in an infinite set of formal <lb/>commuting variables u, T  0  , T  1  , . . . : <lb/> j,k  0  ,k  1  ,... <lb/> (−1) <lb/> j  λ  j  τ <lb/> k  0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> k  1 <lb/> 1  . . . u <lb/> 2j  T  0 <lb/> k  0 <lb/> k  0  ! <lb/> T  1 <lb/> k  1 <lb/> k  1  ! <lb/> . . . , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where the summation is taken over all possible monomials in the symbols τ  i  and over <lb/>all possible values j ≥ 0. Denote by G(u; q  1  , q  2  , . . . ) the series obtained from (1) by the <lb/>following linear substitution of variables <lb/> T  0  = q  1  , <lb/>T  1  = u <lb/> 2  q  1  + 2 u q  2  + q  3  , <lb/>T  2  = u <lb/> 4  q  1  + 6 u <lb/> 3  q  2  + 12 u <lb/> 2  q  3  + 10 u q  4  + 3 q  5  , <lb/>T  3  = u <lb/> 6  q  1  + 14 u <lb/> 5  q  2  + 61 u <lb/> 4  q  3  + 124 u <lb/> 3  q  4  + 131 u <lb/> 2  q  5  + 70 u q  6  + 15 q  7  , <lb/>. . . . <lb/> In general, the linear combination T  k  of the variables q  i  is defined as follows (the meaning <lb/>of this change will be explained in the next section). Consider the sequence of polynomials <lb/> ϕ  k  (u, z), k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , defined by <lb/> ϕ  0  (u, z) = z, ϕ  k+1  (u, z) = D ϕ  k  (u, z) = D <lb/> k+1  ϕ  0  (u, z), where D = (u + z) <lb/> 2  z <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂z <lb/> : <lb/> ϕ  0  = z, ϕ  1  = u <lb/> 2  z + 2uz <lb/> 2  + z <lb/> 3  , ϕ  2  = u <lb/> 4  z + 6u <lb/> 3  z <lb/> 2  + 12u <lb/> 2  z <lb/> 3  + 10uz <lb/> 4  + 3z <lb/> 5  , . . . . <lb/> Then T  k  is obtained form ϕ  k  by replacing z  m  by q  m  in each monomial. Equivalently, T  k  is <lb/>given by the following recursive equation <lb/> T  k+1  = <lb/> m≥1 <lb/> m (u <lb/> 2  q  m  + 2 u q  m+1  + q  m+2  ) <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂q  m <lb/> T  k  , <lb/> (2) <lb/></body>

			<body> By construction, T  k  is a linear combination of variables q  s  , besides, the variable with the <lb/>maximal index s = 2k + 1 enters with the coefficient (2k − 1)!!, and the coefficients of the <lb/>variables with smaller indices contain positive powers of the parameter u. <lb/> Remark that the result of substitution u = 0 to G only depends on variables q  k  with <lb/>odd k and it turns into the Witten&apos;s potential F for the intersection numbers of ψ classes <lb/>after rescaling q  2d+1  = <lb/> t  d <lb/> (2d−1)!!  . <lb/> Theorem 2.1 The series G is a solution of the KP hierarchy with respect to the variables q  i <lb/> (identically in u). <lb/> Witten&apos;s conjecture (now Kontsevich&apos;s theorem, see [W], [Ko]) claims that F is a solution <lb/>of the KdV hierarchy. This statement is an obvious specialization of the previous theorem. <lb/>Indeed, the equations of the KdV hierarchy are obtained from the equations of the KP <lb/>hierarchy by an additional requirement that the function is independent of even variables. <lb/>As it was shown by C. Faber [F] (based on earlier result of Mumford [Mu], see Section 9 <lb/>below), the computation of Hodge integrals can be reduced to the computation of the in-<lb/>tersection indices of ψ classes. In other words, all coefficients of the series G are determined <lb/>by the coefficients of F . Therefore, one can try to derive Theorem 2.1 from the statement <lb/>of Witten&apos;s conjecture. However, our direct arguments are based on the application of <lb/>the ELSV formula relating Hodge integrals to the Hurwitz numbers. The Hurwitz num-<lb/>bers participating in this formula are discussed in the next section. Here we only remark <lb/>that they are relatively simple combinatorial objects, in particular, the generating series <lb/> H(β; p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) for these numbers can be given by the following explicit closed formula <lb/> e <lb/> H  = e <lb/> βM  0  e <lb/> p  1  , <lb/> (3) <lb/>where M  0  is the so-called cut-and-join operator, <lb/> M  0  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> i,j <lb/> (i + j)p  i  p  j <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  i+j <lb/> + i j p  i+j <lb/> ∂  2 <lb/> ∂p  i  ∂p  j <lb/> . <lb/> As we shall see in Section 4, the very existence of a formula like (3) implies immediately <lb/>the following statement. <lb/> Theorem 2.2 (cf. [Ok, KL]) The generating function H for Hurwitz numbers is a solution <lb/>of the KP hierarchy with respect to the variables p  i  (identically in the formal parameter β). <lb/> The ELSV formula expresses the Hurwitz numbers (the coefficients of H) in terms of <lb/>the Hodge integrals (the coefficients of G). By formal manipulations this formula can be <lb/>reduced to the following one. <lb/>Consider two variables x and z related to one another by the changes of variables <lb/> x = <lb/> z <lb/> 1 + β z <lb/>e <lb/> − <lb/> β z <lb/> 1+β z  = z − 2 β z <lb/> 2  + <lb/>7 <lb/>2 <lb/> β <lb/> 2  z <lb/> 3  − <lb/> 17 <lb/>3 <lb/> β <lb/> 3  z <lb/> 4  + . . . , <lb/>z = <lb/> b≥1 <lb/> b  b <lb/> b! <lb/>β <lb/> b−1  x <lb/> b  = x + 2 β x <lb/> 2  + <lb/>9 <lb/>2 <lb/> β <lb/> 2  x <lb/> 3  + <lb/>32 <lb/>3 <lb/> β <lb/> 3  x <lb/> 4  + . . . . <lb/> (4) <lb/>The fact that these changes of variables are inverse to one another follows from the Lagrange <lb/>inversion theorem, see [GJ, GJV1]. These changes provide a linear isomorphism (depending <lb/></body>

			<body> on the parameter β) of the spaces of formal power series in the variables x and z. If we <lb/>identify the linear span of the variables p  i  with the space of formal power series in x and the <lb/>linear span of the variables q  i  with the space of series in z by means of the correspondence <lb/> p  b  ↔ x <lb/> b  , <lb/>q  k  ↔ z <lb/> k  , <lb/> (5) <lb/>then the isomorphism above provides a linear change of variables (depending on the param-<lb/>eter β) between variables p  i  and q  j  . More explicitly, this change is given by <lb/> p  b  = <lb/> k≥b <lb/> c <lb/> b <lb/>k  β <lb/> k−b  q  k  , <lb/> (6) <lb/>where the rational coefficients c  b <lb/>k  are determined by the expansion <lb/> x <lb/> b  = <lb/> k≥b <lb/> c <lb/> b <lb/>k  β <lb/> k−b  z <lb/> k  . <lb/> Let us set also <lb/> H  0,1  = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> b=1 <lb/> b  b−2 <lb/> b! <lb/>p  b  β <lb/> b−1  , <lb/>H  0,2  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∞ <lb/> b  1  ,b  2  =1 <lb/> b <lb/> b  1 <lb/> 1  b <lb/> b  2 <lb/> 2 <lb/> (b  1  + b  2  )b  1  !b  2  ! <lb/> p  b  1  p  b  2  β <lb/> b  1  +b  2  . <lb/> (7) <lb/> Theorem 2.3 The change (6) in H − H  0,1  − H  0,2  leads to the series G of Theorem 2.1, <lb/> up to the rescaling q  k  → β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> k  q  k  and u → β  1/3  , where H = H(β; p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) is the generating <lb/>function for Hurwitz numbers: <lb/> (H − H  0,1  − H  0,2  )|  p=p(β;q)  = G(β <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  ; β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3  q  1  , β <lb/> 8 <lb/>3  q  2  , β <lb/> 12 <lb/>3  q  3  , . . . ). <lb/> Remark 2.4 The action of the change (6) described by Theorem 2.3 can be characterized <lb/>as follows. Consider the plane of coordinates (m, B) and mark all points of this plane <lb/>corresponding to non-trivial terms of the form const p  b  1  . . . p  bn  β  m  in the series H, where <lb/> B = <lb/> b  i  (see the picture).

			<body> linear transformation of the coefficients in H. Furthermore, a coefficient of the original <lb/>series may contribute to some coefficient of the resulting series only if the corresponding <lb/>points lie on the same diagonal m − B = const and the point corresponding to the original <lb/>series has smaller coordinates m and B. After the application of this change to the series <lb/> H − H  0,1  − H  0,2  , we get, after some &apos;magic cancellations&apos;, a series having no nontrivial <lb/>coefficients in the domain m &lt; <lb/> 4 <lb/>3  B. The terms of the resulting series lying on the line <lb/> m = <lb/> 4 <lb/>3  B form the generating series F for intersection numbers of ψ classes and the other <lb/>terms correspond to other summands of the series G of Theorem 2.1 (after the rescaling <lb/> q  i  → β <lb/> − <lb/> 4 <lb/> 3 <lb/> i  q  i  , β <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  → u). <lb/> Consider now an arbitrary invertible formal series x(z) and associate to this series a <lb/>linear change of variables p → p(q) given by <lb/> p  b  = <lb/> k≥b <lb/> c <lb/> b <lb/>k  q  k  , <lb/> (8) <lb/>whose coefficients c  b <lb/>k  are determined by the expansion x  b  = <lb/> k≥b  c  b <lb/>k  z  k  . <lb/> Theorem 2.5 There is a quadratic function Q(p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) such that the transformation <lb/>sending an arbitrary series Φ(p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) to the series Ψ(q  1  , q  2  , . . . ) = (Φ + Q)|  p→p(q)  is an <lb/>authomorphism of the KP hierarchy: it sends solutions to solutions. <lb/>In the case when x(z) = <lb/> z <lb/> 1+β z  e <lb/> − <lb/> β z <lb/> 1+β z  this quadratic function is Q = −H  0,2  . <lb/> Theorem 2.1 is an obvious corollary of Theorems 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5. Indeed, the transfor-<lb/>mation of Theorem 2.3 differs from that of Theorem 2.5 by linear terms H  0,1  that do not <lb/>affect the equations of the KP hierarchy. The rescaling q  k  → β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> k  q  k  is also an automorphism <lb/>of the hierarchy since its equations are quasihomogeneous. Therefore, the validity of these <lb/>equations for the series G is equivalent to their validity for H, which is guaranteed, in turn, <lb/>by the assertion of Theorems 2.2. <lb/> Remark 2.6 The definition for the change (6) looks unmotivated. Implicitly, the same <lb/>change was used in [GJV1], [GJV2]. The only motivation that we can provide here is that <lb/>&apos;it works&apos;. In fact, there is a freedom in the choice of a change inverting the ELSV formula. <lb/>One of the possible changes was used in [KL]. That change did not preserve the whole KP <lb/>hierarchy but was sufficient to derive the KdV equation for the Witten&apos;s potential F . <lb/> 3 The ELSV formula <lb/> This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.3. <lb/>Consider a ramified covering of the sphere S  2  = CP  1  by a smooth surface of genus g <lb/> such that the point ∞ ∈ CP  1  has n marked preimages of multiplicities b  1  , . . . , b  n  and <lb/>all other critical points are simple (with ramification of the second order each) and have <lb/>pairwise different critical values.

			<body> The Hurwitz number h  g;b  1  ,...,bn  is defined as the number of such coverings with a fixed <lb/>position of the critical values; the coverings are counted with their weights inverse to the <lb/>order of the automorphism group of the covering. The celebrated ELSV formula [ELSV] <lb/>expresses these numbers via Hodge integrals: <lb/> h  g;b  1  ,...,bn <lb/> m! <lb/> = <lb/> n <lb/> i=1 <lb/> b <lb/> b  i <lb/> i <lb/> b  i  ! <lb/> M  g,n <lb/> 1 − λ  1  + λ  2  − · · · ± λ  g <lb/>  n <lb/>i=1  (1 − b  i  ψ  i  ) <lb/> . <lb/> It is convenient to pack Hurwitz numbers into the generating series <lb/> H(β; p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) = <lb/> n≥1 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n! <lb/> g,b  1  ,...,bn <lb/> h  g;b  1  ,...,bn <lb/> β  m <lb/> m! <lb/>p  b  1  . . . p  bn  . <lb/> The ELSV formula is not applicable to coverings of genus 0 with 1 or 2 preimages at infinity <lb/>(since the corresponding moduli spaces M  0,1  and M  0,2  do not exist). The summands H  0,1 <lb/> and H  0,2  , respectively, corresponding to such coverings are presented in Eq. (7) of the <lb/>previous section. Let us represent the remaining summands in the form H − H  0,1  − H  0,2  = <lb/> n≥1 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n!  H  n  , where H  n  contains all terms corresponding to the coverings with exactly n <lb/> preimages at infinity.

			<body> Proof. Under the correspondence (5), the series T  d  corresponds to the following function <lb/>in x: <lb/>T  d  ↔ β <lb/> 4 <lb/> 3 <lb/> + <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/> d <lb/> b≥1 <lb/> b  b+d <lb/> b! <lb/>β <lb/> b−1  x <lb/> b  = (β <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  D) <lb/> d  β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3  z(x), <lb/> where D = x <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂x  and where the series z(x) = <lb/> b≥1 <lb/>b  b <lb/> b!  β  b−1  x  b  is inverse to the series x(z) = <lb/> z <lb/> 1+βz  e <lb/> − <lb/> βz <lb/> 1+βz  . It is easy to check that the differential operator D = x <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂x  takes in terms of the <lb/>coordinate z the form <lb/> D = (1 + β z) <lb/> 2  z <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂z <lb/>. <lb/> Under the correspondence (5) the function β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3  z ↔ T  0  turns into β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3  q  1  , and the operator β <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  D <lb/> turns, respectively, into <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  D = <lb/> m≥1 <lb/> m (β <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  q  m  + 2 β <lb/> 5 <lb/>3  q  m+1  + β <lb/> 8 <lb/>3  q  m+2  ) <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂q  m <lb/> = <lb/> m≥1 <lb/> m (β <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/> + <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> m  q  m  + 2 β <lb/> 1 <lb/>3 <lb/> + <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> (m+1)  q  m+1  + β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> (m+2)  q  m+2  ) <lb/>1 <lb/> β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> m <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂q  m <lb/> . <lb/> After rescaling β <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> m  q  m  → q  m  , β <lb/> 1 <lb/>3  → u this operator coincides with the operator participat-<lb/>ing in the recursive relation (2). This proves Lemma 3.1, and hence, Theorem 2.3. <lb/> 4 KP hierarchy <lb/> In this section we recall several well known facts about the KP hierarchy that are suffi-<lb/>cient for the proof of Theorems 2.2 and 2.5. For a more detailed exposition of the theory <lb/>we refer to the papers [DKJM], [MJD], and to Section 6 of the present paper. The KP <lb/>(Kadomtsev-Petviashvili) hierarchy is a particular system of partial differential equations <lb/>on the unknown function (power series) F in infinite set of variables p  1  , p  2  , . . . . Here are <lb/>several first equations of the hierarchy <lb/> F  2,2  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/>1,1  + F  3,1  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>12 <lb/> F  1,1,1,1  , <lb/>F  3,2  = −F  1,1  F  2,1  + F  4,1  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>6 <lb/> F  2,1,1,1  , <lb/>F  4,2  = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/>2,1  − F  1,1  F  3,1  + F  5,1  + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/>1,1,1 <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>12 <lb/> F  1,1  F  1,1,1,1  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F  3,1,1,1  + <lb/>1 <lb/>120 <lb/> F  1,1,1,1,1,1  , <lb/>F  3,3  = <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> F <lb/> 3 <lb/>1,1  − F <lb/> 2 <lb/>2,1  − F  1,1  F  3,1  + F  5,1  + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> F <lb/> 2 <lb/>1,1,1 <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> F  1,1  F  1,1,1,1  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>3 <lb/> F  3,1,1,1  + <lb/>1 <lb/>45 <lb/> F  1,1,1,1,1,1  . <lb/> (9) <lb/>The exponent τ = e  F  of any solution is called the τ -function of the hierarchy. It is <lb/>known that the space of solutions (or the space of τ -functions) is homogeneous: there is a <lb/>Lie algebra <lb/> gl(∞) acting on the space of solutions and the action of the corresponding Lie <lb/>group is transitive. In other words, any solution can be obtained from any other solution <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body> (say, from the solution τ = 1) by the action of an appropriate transformation from this <lb/>group. The actual definition of the Lie algebra <lb/> gl(∞) and of its action is given in Section 6. <lb/>Here we only present several sample operators (acting on τ -functions) belonging to this <lb/>algebra. <lb/> Example 4.1 The scalar operator (the operator of multiplication by a constant) belongs <lb/>to <lb/> gl(∞). It follows that the τ -function is defined up to a multiplicative constant. This <lb/>constant is usually chosen in such a way that τ (0) = 1. In this case the logarithm F = log(τ ) <lb/>is a correctly defined power series if the function τ is. <lb/> Example 4.2 Set <lb/> a  k  = <lb/>  <lb/>   <lb/>  <lb/> p  k <lb/> k &gt; 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> k = 0 <lb/>(−k) <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  −k <lb/> k &lt; 0 <lb/>Then for all k the operator a  k  belongs to <lb/> gl(∞). For positive k this means that addition <lb/>of a linear function preserves the space of solutions of the hierarchy. For negative k this <lb/>means that a shift of arguments also preserves the hierarchy. Both assertions are obvious. <lb/>Indeed, the equations of the hierarchy have constant coefficients and the partial derivatives <lb/>have order at least two. <lb/> Example 4.3 The following operator also belongs to <lb/> gl(∞) for any integer m  = 0: <lb/>Λ  m  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i=−∞ <lb/> a  i  a  m−i  . <lb/> The right hand side is well defined for any m  = 0 since a  i  and a  m−i  commute. For m = 0 <lb/>the formula should be corrected: <lb/>Λ  0  = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i=1 <lb/> a  i  a  −i  = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i=1 <lb/> i p  i <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  i <lb/> . <lb/> For positive m these operators have the following form <lb/>Λ  m  = <lb/> i≥1 <lb/> i p  i+m <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  i <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> m−2  <lb/> j=1 <lb/> p  j  p  m−1−j  , <lb/>m &gt; 0. <lb/>(10) <lb/>For negative m the operators Λ  m  involve second order partial derivatives. The operators <lb/>Λ  −2m  , m ≥ −1, participate in the Virasoro equations for the Witten&apos;s potential of intersec-<lb/>tion indices of ψ classes (see Section 5). <lb/> Example 4.4 The following operators belong to <lb/> gl(∞) for any integer m, <lb/>M  m  = <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i,j=−∞ <lb/> :a  i  a  j  a  m−i−j  :, <lb/></body>

			<body> where we use notation :a  i  1  . . . a  i  k  : = a  σ(i  1  )  . . . a  σ(i  k  )  , where σ is a permutation of the indices <lb/> i  1  , . . . , i  k  such that σ(i  1  ) ≥ · · · ≥ σ(i  k  ). The operator M  0  is called also the cut-and-join <lb/> operator <lb/> M  0  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i,j=1 <lb/> (i + j) p  i  p  j <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂p  i+j <lb/> + i j p  i+j <lb/> ∂  2 <lb/> ∂p  i  ∂p  j <lb/> . <lb/> It is known (see, e.g. [GJ1]) that the exponent of the generating function for Hurwitz <lb/>numbers satisfies the cut-and-join equation <lb/> ∂e  H <lb/> ∂β <lb/> = M  0  e <lb/> H  . <lb/> (11) <lb/>Since for β = 0 the function H|  β=0  = p  1  satisfies the KP hierarchy by trivial reason and since <lb/>the infinitesimal transformation of H with a change of the parameter β belongs to <lb/> gl(∞), <lb/> we conclude that H satisfies the KP hierarchy for all parameter values β. This proves, in <lb/>particular, Theorem 2.2. <lb/>More explicitly, the solution of the cut-and-join equation is given by <lb/> e <lb/> H  = e <lb/> β M  0  e <lb/> p  1  . <lb/> This expression shows that the τ -function e  H  is obtained from the trivial one 1 = e  0  by the <lb/>action of the composition of the operators e  a  1  and e  βM  0  both of which belong to the Lie <lb/>group of the algebra <lb/> gl(∞). <lb/> We are ready now to fulfil the computations leading to the proof of Theorem 2.5. An <lb/>infinitesimal version of the change z → x(z) is a vector field on the line of the coordinate z <lb/> which can be written as a linear combination of the basic fields z  m+1 ∂ <lb/>∂z  , m ≥ 0. These <lb/>fields can be viewed as linear transformations of the space of power series in z: <lb/>z <lb/> m+1  ∂ <lb/>∂z <lb/> : z <lb/> i  → i z <lb/> i+m  . <lb/> Under the correspondence (5) this operator sending p  i  to i p  i+m  can be written as a linear <lb/>differential operator <lb/> i p  i+m <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂p  i <lb/> which is nothing but the &apos;differential&apos; part of the opera-<lb/>tor Λ  m  (10). Integrating such infinitesimal transformations we obtain a global linear change <lb/>of variables of the form (8). The &apos;polynomial&apos; part of Λ  m  is a quadratic form. Since the <lb/>space of quadratic functions is invariant under linear changes of variables, the first statement <lb/>of Theorem 2.5 follows. <lb/>To prove the second statement, we observe that the change x(z) = <lb/> z <lb/> 1+βz  e <lb/> − <lb/> βz <lb/> 1+βz  can be <lb/>obtained from the identity as the time β flow of the non-autonomous vector field −(2 z + <lb/> β z  2  ) z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  . This assertion is a reformulation of the following easily verified identity <lb/> ∂x(z) <lb/>∂β <lb/> = −(2 z + β z <lb/> 2  ) z <lb/>∂x(z) <lb/>∂z <lb/>. <lb/> The field −(2 z + β z  2  ) z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  corresponds to the operator −(2 Λ  1  + β Λ  2  ) ∈ <lb/> gl(∞). It remains <lb/>to check that the quadratic function Q = −H  0,2  agrees with the &apos;polynomial&apos; part of this <lb/>operator. <lb/>Consider an arbitrary series Φ(p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) and set Z(β; q) = exp(Φ−H  0,2  )|  p→p(β;q)  , where <lb/>the linear change of coordinates p → p(β; q) corresponds to our choice of x(z). <lb/></body>

			<body> Lemma 4.5 The series Z is subject to the differential equation <lb/> ∂Z <lb/>∂β <lb/> = −(2 Λ  1  + β Λ  2  )Z. <lb/> Proof. Differentiating the function Z = e  Φ−H  0,2  we get <lb/> ∂Z <lb/>∂β <lb/> = <lb/> − <lb/> ∂H  0,2 <lb/> ∂β <lb/> p=const <lb/> + <lb/> b≥1 <lb/> ∂p  b <lb/> ∂β <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂p  b <lb/> Z. <lb/> (12) <lb/>We wish to rewrite the right hand side in q-coordinates. The arguments above show <lb/>that the second summand is the &apos;differential&apos; part of the operator −(2 Λ  1  + β Λ  2  ): <lb/> b≥1 <lb/> ∂p  b <lb/> ∂β <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂p  b <lb/> = − <lb/> i≥1 <lb/> i (2 q  i+1  + β q  i+2  ) <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂q  i <lb/> . <lb/> (The reader can check this equality by straightforward computations.) For the first sum-<lb/>mand, we have <lb/> − <lb/> ∂H  0,2 <lb/> ∂β <lb/> p=const <lb/> = − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> i,j≥1 <lb/> i  i <lb/> i! <lb/>j  j <lb/> j! <lb/>β <lb/> i+j−1  p  i  p  j  = − <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> i≥1 <lb/> i  i <lb/> i! <lb/>β <lb/> i−1  p  i <lb/>  2 <lb/> = − <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> q <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  , <lb/> which coincides with the &apos;polynomial&apos; part of the operator −(β Λ  2  + 2 Λ  1  ). The lemma is <lb/>proved. <lb/>The lemma shows that Z is a τ -function for any parameter value β if it is for the initial <lb/>parameter value β = 0. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.5. <lb/> 5 Cut-and-join and the Virasoro constrains <lb/> Consider the cut-and-join equation (11) for the generating function of Hurwitz numbers. <lb/>The change of Theorem 2.3 transforming the series H to the series G of Theorem 2.1 acts on <lb/>differential equations as well. The cut-and-join equation is transformed under this change <lb/>into the following one. <lb/> Theorem 5.1 The exponent of the function G of Theorem 2.1 is subject to the differential <lb/>equation <lb/> 1 <lb/>3 <lb/> u <lb/> −2  ∂e  G <lb/> ∂u <lb/> = <lb/> M  0  + 4u <lb/> −1  M  1  + 6u <lb/> −2  M  2  + 4u <lb/> −3  M  3  + u <lb/> −4  M  4 <lb/> − <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/> u <lb/> −3  Λ  0  − u <lb/> −4  Λ  1  + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> u <lb/> −2  a  2  + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> u <lb/> −3  a  3  + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/> u <lb/> −4  a  4 <lb/> e <lb/> G  , <lb/> where the operators a  m  , Λ  m  , and M  m  are defined in the previous section. <lb/> One of the possible proofs is the direct substitution. The reader can try to compute <lb/>himself the coefficients of the equation starting from the definition of the transformation <lb/>sending H to G. More elementary computations leading to the same equation are explained <lb/>in Section 7. <lb/>Each term in the equation of the theorem has degree greater than or equal to −4 with <lb/>respect to the variable u. Since the series F = G|  u=0  only depends on odd variables, we <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body> obtain from the explicit form of M  4  that the variables p  2m  enter the coefficient of u  −4  at <lb/>most linearly. Extracting the coefficient of p  2m+4  u  −4  in the equation we get the equalities <lb/>(2m + 3) <lb/> ∂e  F <lb/> ∂p  2m+3 <lb/> = <lb/> Λ  −2m  + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/> δ  m,0 <lb/> e <lb/> F  , <lb/>m ≥ −1. <lb/> These equations known as Virasoro constrains for the generating function F of the inter-<lb/>section numbers of ψ-classes form an equivalent reformulation of Witten&apos;s conjecture. The <lb/>derivation of the Virasoro constrains presented above is parallel to that from [CLL]. I hope, <lb/>however, that in the presented form the computations look more clear and natural. <lb/> 6 Boson-fermion correspondence <lb/> In this section we review the basics of the boson-fermion correspondence with application <lb/>to Sato Grassmannian and the KP hierarchy. The basic references are [DKJM] and [MJD]. <lb/>Consider the space C[[p  1  , p  2  , . . . ]] of formal power series and consider the additive basis <lb/>in this space formed by Schur functions <lb/> C[[p  1  , p  2  , . . . ]] ≃ <lb/> λ <lb/> C s  λ  (p). <lb/>Schur functions are certain polynomials labelled by partitions (Young diagrams). One of <lb/>the possible their definitions is given below. Here are several of them <lb/> s  0  = 1, <lb/> s  1  = p  1  , <lb/>s  2  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(p <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  + p  2  ), <lb/> s  3  = <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/>(p <lb/> 3 <lb/>1  + 3p  1  p  2  + 2p  3  ), <lb/> s  1,1  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(p <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  − p  2  ), <lb/> s  2,1  = <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/>(p <lb/> 3 <lb/>1  − p  3  ), <lb/> s  1,1,1  = <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/>(p <lb/> 3 <lb/>1  − 3p  1  p  2  + 2p  3  ). <lb/>There is another space with the basis naturally labelled by Young diagrams. Namely, <lb/>consider first an auxiliary space V = C[z  −1  ][[z]] of formal Laurent series. The semi-infinite <lb/>wedge space Λ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 2  V is, by definition, (the completion of) the vector space whose basic vectors <lb/>are semi-infinite formal wedge products of the form <lb/> v  λ  = z <lb/> k  1  ∧ z <lb/> k  2  ∧ . . . , <lb/>k  i  = λ  i  − i. <lb/> The sequences (k  1  , k  2  , . . . ) appearing in these products are just arbitrary strictly decreas-<lb/>ing sequences of integers such that k  i  = −i for sufficiently large i. The elements of the <lb/>space Λ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 2  V can be represented as linear combinations of infinite wedge products of the <lb/>form ϕ  1  (z) ∧ ϕ  2  (z) ∧ . . . , ϕ  i  ∈ V , such that ϕ  i  = z  −i  + (terms of higher order in z) for <lb/>sufficiently large i. Using polylinearity and skew-symmetry of the wedge product one can <lb/>represent such a wedge product as a (possibly infinite) linear combination of basic ones. <lb/>The boson-fermion correspondence is the coordinate-wise isomorphism of vector spaces <lb/> C[p  1  , p  2  , . . . ] ≃ Λ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 2  V, <lb/>s  λ  ↔ v  λ  . <lb/> The spaces on the left and the right hand sides of the isomorphism are called bosonic and <lb/> fermionic Fock spaces (of zero charge), respectively. The vector v  ∅  = z  −1  ∧ z  −2  ∧ z  −3  ∧ . . . <lb/> corresponding to the function s  ∅  = 1 is called the vacuum vector. <lb/> The geometric viewpoint to the theory of KP hierarchy is formulated as follows. <lb/></body>

			<body> Theorem 6.1 The function τ ∈ C[[p  1  , p  2  , . . . ]] is the exponent of a solution of the KP <lb/>hierarchy if and only if its image under boson-fermion correspondence can be represented <lb/>by a decomposable wedge product <lb/> τ ↔ ϕ  1  (z) ∧ ϕ  2  (z) ∧ . . . . <lb/> Decomposable wedge products are characterized uniquely up to a multiplicative constant <lb/>by the linear span of the vectors ϕ  i  . Therefore, the theorem has geometric reformulation that <lb/> τ -functions form the cone over the Grassmannian G  ∞ <lb/> 2 <lb/> (V ) of half-infinite subspaces Plücker <lb/>embedded to the projective space P Λ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 2  (V ). It is known in algebraic geometry that the <lb/>Plücker embedding of the Grassmannian is given by quadratic equations. These algebraic <lb/>equations on the Taylor coefficients of the series τ are called Hirota bilinear equations. They <lb/>can be represented in a form of partial differential equations on τ . These equations rewritten <lb/>in terms of the logarithm F = log(τ ) are exactly the equations of the KP hierarchy. <lb/> Example 6.2 The wedge product (z  −1  + z  2  ) ∧ z  −2  ∧ z  −3  ∧ · · · = v  0  + v  3  corresponds to the <lb/>function <lb/> s  0  + s  3  = 1 + <lb/>1 <lb/>6 <lb/>(p <lb/> 3 <lb/>1  + 3p  1  p  2  + 2p  3  ). <lb/>It follows that its logarithm log(1 + <lb/> 1 <lb/>6  (p  3 <lb/>1  + 3p  1  p  2  + 2p  3  )) satisfies the equations of the KP <lb/>hierarchy. The reader may check this fact by substituting to the first of the equations (9). <lb/>These computations being elementary occupy several pages and are quite laborious when <lb/>made by hand. <lb/>The Grassmannian is a homogeneous space; every subspace can be obtained from any <lb/>other by a linear transformation. The infinite dimension of the spaces under consideration <lb/>implies some additional phenomena that we describe now. Denote by gl(∞) the Lie al-<lb/>gebra of differential operators in one variable z with Laurent coefficients (completed in a <lb/>suitable way that we do not discuss here). Every element of this algebra can be treated <lb/>as a linear operator acting on the space V . This operator is represented in the basis z  i  , <lb/> i ∈ Z, by an infinite matrix a  i,j  , z  j  → <lb/> i  a  ij  z  i  . This algebra is graded by the agreement <lb/>deg(z  i  (∂/∂z)  j  ) = i − j. For the operators of degree k all non-zero components a  i,j  are situ-<lb/>ated on the diagonal i − j = k, moreover, the component a  i,i−k  has polynomial dependance <lb/>on i. <lb/> To every operator A ∈ gl(∞) we associate the operator <lb/> A acting on the fermionic space <lb/>by the following rule. If the matrix of A has no non-trivial diagonal elements, then the <lb/>action of <lb/> A is determined by the Leibnitz rule: <lb/> A(z <lb/> k  1  ∧ z <lb/> k  2  ∧ . . . ) = A(z <lb/> k  1  ) ∧ z <lb/> k  2  ∧ z <lb/> k  3  ∧ · · · + <lb/> z <lb/> k  1  ∧ A(z <lb/> k  2  ) ∧ z <lb/> k  3  ∧ . . . <lb/>z <lb/> k  1  ∧ z <lb/> k  2  ∧ A(z <lb/> k  3  ) ∧ · · · + . . . . <lb/> In the case when A has zero grading, that is, when A = Diag(. . . , a  −1  , a  0  , a  1  , . . . ) is diagonal, <lb/>the application of the above formula may lead to divergency. Therefore, the action of <lb/> A <lb/> should be regularized and we set, by definition, <lb/> A(z <lb/> k  1  ∧ z <lb/> k  2  ∧ . . . ) = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i=1 <lb/> (a  k  i  − a  −i  ) z <lb/> k  1  ∧ z <lb/> k  2  ∧ . . . . <lb/></body>

			<body> Example 6.3 Consider the operator z <lb/> ∂ <lb/> ∂z  ∈ gl(∞), z  k  → k z  k  . Its image <lb/> z ∂/∂z is called <lb/>the energy operator. Every basic vector v  λ  is an eigenvector for this operator with the <lb/>corresponding eigenvalue |λ| = <lb/> λ  i  . The eigenvalues of the energy operator give rise to the <lb/>grading on the space Λ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 2  V . Under boson-fermion correspondence this grading corresponds <lb/>to the quasihomogeneous grading in the space of power series in the variables p  i  with <lb/>deg p  i  = i. In other words, <lb/> z ∂/∂z = <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> i=1  i p  i <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂p  i <lb/> . <lb/>The correspondence A → <lb/> A is not a Lie algebra homomorphism. For example, the <lb/>operators of the multiplication by x  m  commute for different m, but one can easily compute <lb/>that [ <lb/> x  m  , <lb/> x  n  ] = n δ  m,−n  . In fact, one has [ <lb/> A, <lb/> B] = <lb/> [A, B] + (scalar operator). Therefore, <lb/>we obtain not a linear but a projective representation of the Lie algebra gl(∞). More <lb/>exactly, the value of the scalar correction forms a cocycle. Therefore, we obtain a linear <lb/>representation not of the algebra gl(∞) itself but of its one-dimensional central extension <lb/>denoted by <lb/> gl(∞). This algebra is generated by the operators of the form <lb/> A and by the <lb/>scalar operators. <lb/>Remark, however, that the most part of the operators used in the present paper lie in <lb/>the subalgebra of upper triangular matrices (that is, the operators of non-negative grading). <lb/>The cocycle is trivial on this subalgebra and the correspondence A → <lb/> A is a Lie algebra <lb/>homomorphism. <lb/> Proposition 6.4 The action of the Lie group of the algebra <lb/> gl(∞) preserves the set of <lb/>decomposable vectors. <lb/> Indeed, if the matrix of A has zero diagonal entries, then <lb/> e <lb/> t b <lb/> A  (ϕ  1  ∧ ϕ  2  ∧ . . . ) = e <lb/> tA  ϕ  1  ∧ e <lb/> tA  ϕ  2  ∧ . . . . <lb/> Similarly, if A = Diag(. . . , a  −1  , a  0  , a  1  , . . . ), then <lb/> e <lb/> t b <lb/> A  (ϕ  1  ∧ ϕ  2  ∧ . . . ) = e <lb/> t(A−a  1  )  ϕ  1  ∧ e <lb/> t(A−a  2  )  ϕ  2  ∧ . . . . <lb/> The proposition suggests a natural way to construct solutions of the KP hierarchy. It is <lb/>sufficient to pick any transformation from the corresponding Lie group and to apply it to the <lb/>vacuum vector. The resulting vector corresponds under boson-fermion correspondence to <lb/>the τ -function of some solution. In order to apply this procedure in practice, it is useful to <lb/>have an explicit description of the action of the Lie algebra <lb/> gl(∞) in terms of the variables p  i  . <lb/> Proposition 6.5 The correspondence between the differential operators in z of order at <lb/>most two and the action of these operators in C[[p  1  , p  2  , . . . ]] is presented in the following <lb/>table <lb/> Notation <lb/>Action in  V = C[[z]][z  −1  ] <lb/> Action in  C[[p  1  , p  2  , . . . ]] <lb/> a  m  , m &gt; 0 <lb/> z  m <lb/> p  m <lb/> a  −m  , m &gt; 0 <lb/> z  −m <lb/> m <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂pm <lb/> a  0 <lb/> 1 <lb/>0 <lb/>Λ  m <lb/> z  m  (z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  + <lb/> m+1 <lb/> 2  ) <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> i=−∞  :a  i  a  m−i  : <lb/> M  m <lb/> z  m  ( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  )  2  + <lb/> m+1 <lb/> 2  z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  + <lb/> (m+1)(m+2) <lb/>12 <lb/> ) <lb/> 1 <lb/>6 <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> i,j=−∞  :a  i  a  j  a  m−i−j  : <lb/></body>

			<body> The equality <lb/> z  m  = a  m  = p  m  can be used for an independent invariant definition of the <lb/>boson-fermion correspondence. Namely, the polynomial (or the formal series) P (p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) <lb/>corresponds to the vector P (a  1  , a  2  , . . . )v  ∅  of the semi-infinite wedge space. Conversely, any <lb/>function can be recovered from its partial derivatives by the Taylor formula <lb/> P (p  1  , p  2  , . . . ) = e <lb/> P <lb/> pm <lb/> ∂ <lb/> ∂qm  P (q  1  , q  2  , . . . ) <lb/> q=0 <lb/> . <lb/> Therefore the equality <lb/> z  −m  = a  −m  = m <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂pm  can be used for the inverse homomorphism of <lb/>the boson-fermion correspondence: the vector v ∈ Λ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> 2  V corresponds to the series <lb/> v ←→ e <lb/> P  pma −m <lb/> m <lb/> v  0  , <lb/> where ·  0  denotes the coefficient of the vacuum vector. If these equalities are taken as the <lb/>definition of the boson-fermion correspondence, then its coordinate presentation given in <lb/>the beginning of this section can serve as the definition of Schur functions. <lb/>For the operators Λ  m  the correspondence of the table is proved, for example, in [KS] <lb/>(in a slightly different normalization). The case of the cut-and-join operator M  0  is treated <lb/>in [KL] in the relationship with the Hurwitz theory: this operator is diagonal and the cor-<lb/>respondence is established by comparison of the eigenvalues. Finally, for the operators M  n  , <lb/> n  = 0, the correspondence follows from the commutating relations <lb/>2 n M  n  = [M  0  , Λ  n  ] − <lb/> n  3  − n <lb/> 12 <lb/> a  n  , <lb/> that can be checked independently both in the space of differential operators in one variable z <lb/> and in the space of differential operators in the variables p  1  , p  2  , . . . . <lb/> Example 6.6 Since  1 = 0, the cut-and-join operator can be represented in the form M  0  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  )  2  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>6  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  )  2  . Therefore the exponent e  H  of the generating function <lb/>for the Hurwitz numbers (see Example 4.4) corresponds to the infinite wedge product <lb/> e <lb/> βM  0  e <lb/> a  −1  v  ∅  = ϕ  1  ∧ ϕ  2  ∧ ϕ  3  ∧ . . . , <lb/> where <lb/> ϕ  k  = e <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> [(z <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂z <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> )  2  −( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> −k)  2  ]  e <lb/> z  z <lb/> −k  = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i=0 <lb/> e <lb/> β <lb/> 2 <lb/> [(i−k+ <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> )  2  −( <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> −k)  2  ]  z  −k+i <lb/> i! <lb/>. <lb/> 7 Once again about the change of coordinates in the ELSV <lb/> In the framework of the boson-fermion correspondence, the proof of Theorem 2.5 takes the <lb/>following form. Consider the transformation Ξ sending any function Φ(p) to the function <lb/>Ψ(q) = (Φ − H  0,2  )|  p→p(q)  . This transformation belongs to the Lie group of the Lie alge-<lb/>bra <lb/> gl(∞), therefore, it can be considered, via the boson-fermion correspondence, as a linear <lb/>transformation Ξ of the space L of Laurent series in z. <lb/> Proposition 7.1 The transformation Ξ is given explicitly by <lb/> Ξ : ϕ(z) → ψ(β, z) = (1 + βz) <lb/> − <lb/> 3 <lb/>2  e <lb/> − <lb/> βz <lb/> 2(1+βz)  ϕ <lb/> z <lb/> 1+βz  e <lb/> − <lb/> βz <lb/> 1+βz <lb/> . <lb/> (13) <lb/></body>

			<body> Proof. The transformation Ξ is obtained by integrating the differential equation of <lb/>Lemma 4.5. Using the correspondence from the table of Proposition 6.5 one can rewrite <lb/>this equation as the following one: <lb/> ∂ψ <lb/> ∂β <lb/> = −(2 Λ  1  + β Λ  2  )ψ <lb/>= −2 <lb/> z <lb/> 2  ∂ψ <lb/>∂z <lb/> + z ψ <lb/> − β <lb/> z <lb/> 3  ∂ψ <lb/>∂z <lb/> + <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/> z <lb/> 2  ψ <lb/> = − <lb/> 2 z <lb/> 2  + β z <lb/> 3 <lb/>  ∂ψ <lb/>∂z <lb/> − <lb/> 2 z + <lb/>3 <lb/>2 <lb/> β z <lb/> 2 <lb/> ψ. <lb/> (14) <lb/>This linear PDE can be solved explicitly using, for example, the method of characteristics. <lb/>The solution is presented in the formula of the proposition (as long as the formula is pre-<lb/>sented, there is no difficulty to check its validity by the direct substitution to the equation). <lb/>The proposition is proved. <lb/>The statement of the proposition is applicable also if the initial function ϕ depends on <lb/>additional parameters. Consider the transformation e  γM  0  e  a  1  sending the vacuum vector to <lb/>the exponent e  H(γ;p)  of the generating function for Hurwitz numbers (see Example 4.4; we <lb/>changed temporarily from β to γ the notation for the parameter in this transformation). <lb/>The Laurent series obtained by the action of this transformation satisfy the cut-and-join <lb/>equation <lb/> ∂ϕ <lb/>∂γ <lb/> = M  0  ϕ = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> z <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂z <lb/>  2  + <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  z <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂z <lb/> + <lb/> 1 <lb/>12 <lb/> ϕ. <lb/> The change (13) acts on this equation and the direct substitution shows that for the trans-<lb/>formed function ψ the equation takes the form <lb/> ∂ψ <lb/>∂γ <lb/> = <lb/> M  0  + 4βM  1  + 6β <lb/> 2  M  2  + 4β <lb/> 3  M  3  + β <lb/> 4  M  4  + <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/> β <lb/> 2  z <lb/> 2  + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> β <lb/> 3  z <lb/> 3  + <lb/>1 <lb/>8 <lb/> β <lb/> 4  z <lb/> 4 <lb/> ψ <lb/> (15) <lb/>Since γ = β, we get that the total derivative over the parameter is given by the sum of the <lb/>operators on the right hand sides of (14) and (15). Taking into account the change γ = <lb/> β = u  3  and the corrections arisen from addition of linear terms H  0,1  and from the rescaling <lb/> q  i  → u  −4i  q  i  that can be written in terms of Laurent series as the rescaling z → u  −4  z, we <lb/>obtain finally the equation of Theorem 5.1. <lb/>All these computations being slightly cumbersome are nevertheless absolutely elemen-<lb/>tary; they are fulfilled in the space of differential operators (of order not greater than 2) <lb/>in one variable z. In particular, we have finite number of summands at every step of <lb/>computation. <lb/> 8 Remark on the λ  g  conjecture <lb/> The conjecture of C. Faber (proved by now in several different ways) asserts the equality <lb/> Mg,n <lb/> λ  g  ψ <lb/> d  1 <lb/> 1  . . . ψ <lb/> dn <lb/>n  = <lb/> 2g − 3 + n <lb/>d  1  , . . . , d  n <lb/> c  g  , <lb/> (16) <lb/>where <lb/> d  i  = 2g − 3 + n and where the constant c  g  depends only on g but is independent <lb/>of n and of the exponents d  i  . One of the simplest proofs of this equality is given in [GJV2]. <lb/>Using the language of the present paper this proof becomes even more transparent and is <lb/>reduced to the following. <lb/></body>

The operation Σ  m  provides an <lb/>isomorphism between the space of homogeneous of degree m polynomials in t  0  , t  1  , . . . and <lb/>the space of all symmetric polynomials in x  1  , . . . , x  m  . Besides, we have, by definition, <lb/>Σ  m  P  m,d  = (x  1  + · · · + x  m  )  d  .

			<body> For the proof of Theorem 8.1 consider the generating series G of Theorem 2.1 for Hodge <lb/>integrals. Set v = u  −3  = β  −1  . A simple counting of dimensions shows that the series G can <lb/>be rewritten in the form <lb/> G(q) = v <lb/> −1 <lb/> j,k  0  ,k  1  ,... <lb/> (−1) <lb/> g−j  λ  g−j  τ <lb/> k  0 <lb/> 0  τ <lb/> k  1 <lb/> 1  . . . v <lb/> j <lb/> T <lb/> k  0 <lb/> 0 <lb/> k  0  ! <lb/> T <lb/> k  1 <lb/> 1 <lb/> k  1  ! <lb/> . . . , <lb/> T  k  = v <lb/> 1−k <lb/>3  T  k  , <lb/> where T  k  are linear functions in the variables q  i  defined by (2). Let us make one more <lb/>change of coordinates passing to the variables r  1  , r  2  , . . . related to q  k  by the equalities <lb/> q  k  = <lb/> k <lb/> i=1 <lb/>  k <lb/>i <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k−i  v <lb/> i− <lb/> k <lb/> 3 <lb/> −1  r  i  . <lb/> Under the identification q  k  ↔ z  k  the variable r  k  corresponds to the polynomial r  k  ↔ <lb/> v (v <lb/> − <lb/> 2 <lb/>3  z + v  −1  )  k  − v  1−k  . Up to a rescaling, passing to the new variables r  k  is equivalent to <lb/>the shift z → z + 1 in the space of polynomials in z. In terms of new variables the recursive <lb/>equations (2) take the following form <lb/> T  0  = r  0  , <lb/> T  k+1  = <lb/> m≥1 <lb/> m (v r  m+2  − r  m+1  ) <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂r  m <lb/> T  k  . <lb/> It follows immediately by induction that the summand of the smallest degree in v in <lb/> T  k  is <lb/>equal to (−1)  k  k!r  k+1  : <lb/> T  0  = r  1  , <lb/> T  1  = −r  2  + v r  3  , <lb/> T  2  = 2 r  3  − 5 v q  4  + 3 v <lb/> 2  r  5  , <lb/> T  3  = −6 r  4  + 26 v r  5  − 35 v <lb/> 2  r  6  + 15 v <lb/> 3  r  7  , <lb/>. . . . <lb/> Denote by Ψ = Ψ(v; r  1  , r  2  , . . . ) the series v G expressed in terms of the variables r  k  . We <lb/>conclude <lb/> Proposition 8.2 The series Ψ is a power series with respect to the parameter v; for v = 0 <lb/> this series turns into the generating function F  top  for the top Hodge integrals after the <lb/>substitution <lb/> t  k  = <lb/> T  k  |  v=0  = (−1) <lb/> k  k!r  k+1  . <lb/> We would like to apply the change of variables to the &apos;cat-and-join&apos; equation of Theo-<lb/>rem 5.1 for G in order to obtain the corresponding equation for Ψ. Remark that the change <lb/>corresponding to the shift z → z + 1 in the space of polynomials in z preserves the KP <lb/>hierarchy (in spite of the fact that the action of this shift is not defined on the space of <lb/>Laurent series). However, the subsequent rescaling is not quasihomogeneous and destroys <lb/>the hierarchy. Therefore, it is convenient to introduce &apos;intermediate&apos; variables <lb/>  i  = r  i  /v and <lb/>to denote by <lb/> G the series G expressed in terms of these variables. Then we have <lb/>Ψ(r  1  , r  2  , . . . ) = v <lb/> G(r  1  /v, r  2  /v, . . . ). <lb/>(17) <lb/></body>

			<body> The transition from the variables q  i  tõ <lb/> r  i  corresponds to the linear non-homogeneous <lb/>change z  → v <lb/> − <lb/> 2 <lb/> 3  z + v  −1  in the space of polynomials in z. Applying this change to the <lb/>differential operator in z corresponding to the right hand side of the equality of Theorem 5.1 <lb/>we compute the action of this change on the bosonic side as well. As a result of these <lb/>computations (that are absolutely elementary since they do not require consideration of <lb/>infinite sums) we arrive at the following statement. <lb/> Proposition 8.3 The series <lb/> G in the variables  <lb/>  k  is a solution of the KP hierarchy (iden-<lb/> tically in v) and its dependence in the parameter v is described by the differential equation <lb/> ∂e <lb/> e <lb/> G <lb/> ∂v <lb/> = <lb/> −M  2  + 2 v M  3  − M  4  + Λ  1  + <lb/> v <lb/> 6 <lb/> a  3  − <lb/> v  2 <lb/> 8 <lb/> a  4 <lb/> e <lb/> e <lb/> G  . <lb/> The final rescaling (17) exits the space of solutions of the KP hierarchy. Fortunately, this <lb/>change is simple enough in order to be able to compute its action on differential operators <lb/>in the variables r  1  , r  2  , . . . directly. We get the following. <lb/> Corollary 8.4 The series Ψ of Proposition 8.2 satisfies the equation <lb/> v <lb/>∂Ψ <lb/>∂v <lb/> = Ψ + <lb/> i≥1 <lb/> (v i r  i+1  − r  i  ) <lb/> ∂Ψ <lb/>∂r  i <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> i+j=k <lb/>i,j,k≥1 <lb/> i j v (−r  k+2  + 2 v r  k+3  − v <lb/> 2  r  k+4  ) <lb/> v <lb/>∂  2  Ψ <lb/> ∂r  i  ∂r  j <lb/> + <lb/> ∂Ψ <lb/>∂r  i <lb/> ∂Ψ <lb/>∂r  j <lb/> + r  i  r  j <lb/> −(k − 2) <lb/> ∂Ψ <lb/>∂r  k−2 <lb/> + 2 v (k − 3) <lb/> ∂Ψ <lb/>∂r  k−3 <lb/> − v <lb/> 2  (k − 4) <lb/> ∂Ψ <lb/>∂r  k−4 <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>3 <lb/> r <lb/> 3 <lb/>1  − <lb/> v <lb/> 2 <lb/> r <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  r  2  + <lb/> v  2 <lb/> 6 <lb/> r  3  − <lb/> v  3 <lb/> 8 <lb/> r  4  . <lb/> Setting v = 0 in this equation and denoting t  k  = (−1)  k  k!r  k+1  we obtain the required <lb/>equation of Theorem 8.1. <lb/> 9 Reduction of Hodge integrals <lb/> For completeness, we review in this section a formula expressing the Hodge integrals in terms <lb/>of intersection numbers of just ψ-classes. Denote by F(u, T  0  , T  1  , . . . ) the generating series (1) <lb/>for Hodge integrals written in terms of T -variables. Then F (T ) = F(0, T ) is the Witten&apos;s <lb/>potential for intersection numbers of ψ-classes. The algorithm outlined in [F] allowing one <lb/>to recover F from F is essentially equivalent to the following formula (cf. [FP],[G]): <lb/> e <lb/> F  = e <lb/> W  e <lb/> F  , <lb/>W = − <lb/> ∞ <lb/> k=1 <lb/>B  2k  u  2(2k−1) <lb/> 2k(2k−1) <lb/>  ∂ <lb/>∂t  2k <lb/> − <lb/> ∞ <lb/> i=0 <lb/> t  i <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂t  i+2k−1 <lb/> + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> i+j=2k−2 <lb/> (−1) <lb/> i  ∂  2 <lb/> ∂t  i  ∂t  j <lb/> , <lb/> (18) <lb/>where B  m  &apos;s are the Bernoulli numbers. <lb/>The Chern classes λ  i  of the Hodge bundle over M  g,n  can be expressed via the homoge-<lb/>neous components of its Chern character ch = g + ch  1  + ch  2  + . . . by the identity <lb/>1 − u <lb/> 2  λ  1  + u <lb/> 4  λ  2  − u <lb/> 6  λ  3  + · · · = e <lb/> − <lb/> P  ∞ <lb/> m=1  (m−1)!chmu  2m  . <lb/></body>
