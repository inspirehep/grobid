			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The current understanding of the mechanism leading to time-reversal violation <lb/>(TRV) in particle physics is one of the greatest achievements of the Standard Model <lb/>(SM). At the same time there is a strong push to move the theory beyond the SM, <lb/>both to relate the parameters of the SM to an underlying larger framework and <lb/>to address questions raised by cosmological observations. The search for TRV can <lb/>play an important role in this respect. Theoretical models that try to provide a new <lb/>framework nearly always predict additional sources of TRV that are not in the SM. <lb/>Therefore, establishing new limits for non-SM TRV will constrain these new models. <lb/>In this work we will discuss two approaches involving searches at low energy for <lb/>TRV beyond the SM. The first approach is the measurement of β–ν correlations <lb/>in β-decay, which has the potential for TRV searches but will also allow to obtain <lb/>additional input on the already precise value of the CKM matrix element V  ud  . The <lb/>second approach concerns searches for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) <lb/>of heavy nuclei. <lb/></body>

			<body> The outline of this paper is as follows: We will first discuss the complementarity <lb/>of the two methods and then discuss the current status of experiments for both <lb/>approaches in general, and more specifically for the work undertaken at Kernfysisch <lb/>Versneller Instituut (KVI), in the next two sections. <lb/> 2. Complementarity of searches for TRV <lb/> The correlations in nuclear β-decay can be written schematically as <lb/>d <lb/> 2  Γ <lb/>dΩ  e  dΩ  ν <lb/> ∼ 1 + a ˆ <lb/> p · ˆ <lb/> q + b <lb/>m  e <lb/> E  e <lb/> (1) <lb/>+ <lb/> J · [Aˆ  + B ˆ <lb/> q + D ˆ <lb/> p × ˆ <lb/> q] <lb/> ( 2 ) <lb/>+  σ · <lb/> Gˆ  + N <lb/> J + R <lb/> J × ˆ <lb/> p <lb/> , <lb/> (3) <lb/>wherê <lb/> p = <lb/>p/E  e  and <lb/>  = q/E  ν  are the velocity vectors of the β-particle and neutrino, <lb/>respectively, <lb/>J is the spin of the parent nucleus and σ is the spin of the β-particle. <lb/> The first part (1) describes the β–ν correlation when the parent nucleus is not <lb/>polarized and is characterized by the coefficients a and b. The second part (2) deals <lb/>with correlations with respect to the direction of the spin of the parent nuclei. <lb/>The coefficients A and B are the well-known β and neutrino decay-asymmetry <lb/>coefficients, respectively. The fact that they are not zero expresses parity violation, <lb/>i.e. ˆ <lb/> p and <lb/>  change sign under parity (P ) while  <lb/>J  does not. For the coefficient <lb/> D the correlation is even under P but is odd under time reversal (T ) (all vectors <lb/>change sign). The last part (3) requires measuring the polarization of the β-particle. <lb/> Also for R the correlation is T -odd, but in addition it is P -odd. <lb/>Turning now to the EDM: Because its value can be understood as a displacement <lb/>of charge on the one hand, i.e. <lb/>d = Δqq r (P -odd) and proportional to the spin of <lb/>the particle on the other hand, i.e. <lb/>d = η <lb/> e <lb/>mc  s (T -odd), it follows that <lb/>d must be <lb/>odd under both P and T [1]. <lb/>Therefore, when searching for new sources of TRV the search for an EDM is in <lb/>some way equivalent to searching for a finite triple correlation R. This has been <lb/>reviewed by Herczeg [2] who finds that EDM limits are stronger in restricting the <lb/>boundaries for new physics. In contrast, there might be new interactions (e.g. <lb/>leptoquark exchanges) [3] that cannot be observed from a finite EDM but could be <lb/>found from a finite value of the T -odd triple correlation D [2]. Therefore, in this <lb/>respect, the search for the correlation coefficient D is complementary to search for <lb/>a finite EDM. <lb/>Finally, we note that correlation coefficients in β-decay measure the mixing ratio <lb/> ρ of the Gamow–Teller (GT) and Fermi (F) matrix elements. <lb/> ρ = <lb/> C  A  M  GT <lb/> C  V  M  F <lb/> , <lb/> (4) <lb/>where C  A  and C  V  are the axial-vector and vector coupling coefficients, respectively. <lb/>Therefore, by measuring the correlation coefficients and the strength of the β-decay <lb/></body>

			<body> (ft value) one can, in principle, obtain data of similar quality for mirror transitions <lb/>as in superallowed Fermi transitions that serve as input in the determination of V  ud <lb/> [4]. This point has recently been stressed by Naviliat-Cuncic and Severijns [5] and <lb/>may give additional motivation to study correlations. <lb/> 3. Correlations in β-decay <lb/> Presently the only measurements of the triple correlation coefficient D are for the <lb/>neutron and <lb/> 19  Ne. The neutron experiments have led to values of D = [−0.6 ± <lb/> 1.2(stat.)±0.5(syst.)]×10 <lb/> −3  [6] and = [−2.8±6.4(stat.)±3.0(syst.)]×10 <lb/> −4  [7] from <lb/>the emiT experiment and the TRINE Collaboration, respectively. Measurements <lb/>with <lb/> 19  Ne have been pursued by the Calaprice group, and the combined value of <lb/>four experiments was given as D = (1 ± 6) × 10 <lb/> −4  [8] which is the most precise <lb/>value to date. To push the limit further, final-state interactions (FSI) that mimic a <lb/>non-zero D coefficient have to be taken into account. Recently, it was claimed that <lb/>using effective field theory the effects of FSI can be calculated up to 10 <lb/> −7  [9] (the <lb/>SM value is D ≤ 10 <lb/> −12  [10]). However, experiments need to become much more <lb/>precise to reach a level of 10 <lb/> −7  . <lb/>A new technique is the trapping of a sample in an atom or ion trap and to <lb/>observe the recoiling ion in coincidence with the β-particle. Such traps also allow <lb/>to polarize the sample. Currently, experiments have been limited to measuring the <lb/> β–ν correlation coefficient a of the unpolarized sample. These efforts have resulted <lb/>in precise values of a that can compete with the various indirect techniques that do <lb/>not allow triple correlation measurements. In particular results have been obtained <lb/>for <lb/> 38m  K [11] and <lb/> 21  Na [12]. The values a  exp  /a  SM  = 0.9981 ± 0.0030 <lb/> +0.0032 <lb/> −0.0037  for <lb/> 38m  K and 0.9949 ± 0.0069 ± 0.0091 for <lb/> 21  Na are to be compared with the value <lb/>0.9989 ± 0.0052 ± 0.0039 obtained indirectly for <lb/> 32  Ar [13,14]. Note that for the case <lb/>of <lb/> 21  Na the systematic error includes the uncertainty in the SM prediction, because <lb/>it is a mixed transition. Only mixed transitions can be used for determining the D <lb/> coefficient, i.e. D ∝ δ  JJ   M  F  M  GT  . <lb/>Measurements involving polarization of the trapped sample have also been re-<lb/>ported, particularly on <lb/> 82  Rb [15,16], <lb/> 37  K [17] and <lb/> 80  Rb [18]. These measurements <lb/>can already address issues concerning the β- and ν-asymmetry coefficients A and <lb/> B. The development of this technique is an important step towards measuring D. <lb/> At KVI we are developing a set-up to measure the correlation coefficient D. <lb/> We have set up the TRIμP Facility for these and other studies of fundamental <lb/>symmetries and interactions and to produce radioactive nuclei and to trap these <lb/>in atom and ion traps. In a magnetic separator [19], projectiles are separated <lb/>from products produced in inverse kinematics [20]. The particles are stopped in <lb/>a thermal ionizer [21]. Such a device is well suited to ionize alkali and alkaline-<lb/>earth elements, which are the elements that can be laser cooled and trapped the <lb/>easiest. From the thermal ionizer the radioactive particles can be transported as a <lb/>secondary low-energy ion beam. This beam enters a set-up [22] consisting of two <lb/>chambers configured for a magneto-optical trap (MOT) as shown in figure 1. <lb/>In the first small chamber the ions are collected on a foil that can be heated <lb/>to release atoms. The atoms can then be trapped. We have chosen to work with <lb/>the mirror nucleus <lb/> 21  Na as for this element most of the laser infrastructure was <lb/></body>

			<body> Figure 1. Schematic drawing of the collector and detection trap configura-<lb/>tion. <lb/> available. We have observed the fluorescence of <lb/> 21  Na but it is not yet sufficient to <lb/>start measurements. Currently we are installing a transfer line by which the trapped <lb/>atoms can be pushed towards the second MOT chamber. The second large chamber <lb/>contains a position-sensitive β-detector and a reaction microscope. The latter is a <lb/>device to observe ionized recoils from β-decay and measure their momentum with <lb/>4π efficiency. This instrument has been developed for atomic physics experiments <lb/>[23]. It can be used in the energy range suitable for our work (E  recoil  ≈ 100 eV). <lb/>We recently studied [24] the response of the reaction microscope by ionizing the <lb/>trapped <lb/> 23  Na using a UV laser. Atoms in the excited state of the cooling cycle <lb/>( <lb/> 2  P  3/2  ) can be probed in this way. In figure 2 the ions hitting the 2D sensitive <lb/>multichannel plate (MCP) of the microscope can be seen. The intense region near <lb/>the centre of the spectrum is from particles initially in the MOT cloud. The region <lb/>has a diameter less than 1 mm. It is surrounded by a larger region of several mm <lb/>of atoms that are cooled but not yet trapped (molasses). The sparsely populated <lb/>circular region corresponds approximately to the sensitive area of the MCP and is <lb/>due to random ionization throughout the volume of the microscope and are mostly <lb/>uncorrelated with the UV pulse. Whereas the fluorescence of the atoms in the <lb/>MOT cloud is visible to the naked eye, the halo around is not. Further study <lb/>is required to find if this halo affects correlation measurements. These and other <lb/>studies characterizing the set-up are currently in progress using mostly stable <lb/> 23  Na. <lb/>As a final remark we note that precise lifetimes, branching ratios and Q-values are <lb/>necessary when interpreting correlation coefficients of nuclei with mixed transitions, <lb/>in particular of mirror nuclei, i.e. nuclei relevant for measuring D. A recent eval-<lb/>uation [25] shows which measurements are most relevant. The relevance of mixed <lb/>transitions for measuring V  ud  was already mentioned in the previous section. A <lb/>new measurement of the <lb/> 19  Ne and <lb/> 21  Na was recently made at KVI in collaboration <lb/>with a group from TUNL [26]. <lb/></body>

Searches for a permanent electric dipole moment <lb/> Low-energy searches for EDMs are one of the main constraints on theories that are <lb/>currently pursued in detail.

			<body> Figure 3. Atomic level scheme of low-lying states in Ra and some relevant <lb/>transitions. <lb/> using storage rings [33,34] are being investigated, in particular for the proton and <lb/>deuteron. The deuteron is of relevance because of its sensitivity to T -odd nuclear <lb/>interactions [35]. Nonetheless, the strongest limits in the near future are expected to <lb/>come from heavy atoms and molecules. Writing the dipole of a system schematically <lb/>as a perturbation <lb/> d = <lb/> i <lb/> Ψ  0  |D|Ψ  i  Ψ  i  |H  EDM  |Ψ  0  <lb/> E  0  − E  i <lb/> + c.c., <lb/>(5) <lb/>where D is the usual dipole operator, one observes that systems that are strongly <lb/>polarizable (large Ψ  0  |D|Ψ  i  ) and/or have nearly degenerate opposite parity states <lb/>(small E  0  − E  i  ) will show the strongest effect given the strength of the P -and <lb/> T -odd interaction H  EDM  (for more details, see [1]). For our research we use both <lb/> 225  Ra from a <lb/> 229  Th source and Ra isotopes near <lb/> 213  Ra, the latter is produced in <lb/>our facility using the <lb/> 206  Pb + <lb/> 12  C reaction [36]. Ra has two possible enhancement <lb/>factors apart from being a heavy atom. <lb/>The 7s7p <lb/> 3  P  1  and 7s6d <lb/> 3  D  2  (see figure 3) are nearly degenerate leading to the <lb/>enhancement of a possible electron EDM in Ra of a factor 5000 [37]. In addition, <lb/>for some Ra isotopes, enhancement of the order of 10 <lb/> 5  [37] of the EDM of nuclear <lb/>origin arises due to octupole deformation and using the degeneracy of 7s7p <lb/> 3  P  1  and <lb/>7s6d <lb/> 3  D  2  states. Recently, <lb/> 225,226  Ra was trapped [38] using the <lb/> 1  S  0  – <lb/> 3  P  1  transi-<lb/>tion. This line is inefficient for cooling due to the long lifetime of the <lb/> 3  P  1  state. <lb/>At KVI we are aiming to use the short-lived <lb/> 1  P  1  for the cooling cycle. A draw-<lb/>back is the strong leaking to the metastable D states. Recently, we demonstrated <lb/>in the homologous Ba, which had not been trapped before, that employing suit-<lb/>able lasers for optical repumping can solve this problem and provide large capture <lb/>efficiencies [39]. <lb/></body>
