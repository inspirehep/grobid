These neutrinos come from the decay of π and K mesons (the conventional flux) and <lb/>from the decay of charmed mesons (the prompt flux). Although several flux predictions exist, the electron neutrino flux <lb/>has been measured only up to GeV energies. At TeV energies, where atmospheric neutrinos are an inevitable source <lb/>of background events for astrophysical neutrino searches, the prompt flux becomes important and the flux predictions <lb/>vary greatly. The detection of electromagnetic and hadronic particle showers, which are not only produced by electron <lb/>neutrinos but which can be found in the final states of charged and neutral current interactions of all neutrino flavours, <lb/>remains challenging. Given the sensitivity to all neutrino flavours, the good energy resolution that will be possible with <lb/>fully contained shower events and the possibility to isolate the prompt from the conventional flux, the prospects of this <lb/>detection channel are very promising. This poster will present an analysis done on a data sample collected with IceCube <lb/>in its 40 string configuration as it was running from 2008 to 2009. The development of the event selection on a small part <lb/>of the sample will be discussed. <lb/> Corresponding Author: Eike Middell <lb/> 2  (eike.middell@desy.de) <lb/> 2  DESY Zeuthen, Platanenallee 6, 15738 Zeuthen, Germany <lb/> Keywords: atmospheric neutrinos, IceCube, particle showers <lb/></front>

			<body> 1 Observing Neutrinos at the South Pole <lb/> The possibility to measure or constrain the flux of astro-<lb/>physical neutrinos could help to solve a number of ques-<lb/>tions of which one of the most prominent, the question <lb/>of the origin of cosmic rays, remains unanswered nearly <lb/>a century after their discovery. Experiments that aim at the <lb/>detection of these neutrinos must compensate for the small <lb/>interaction cross sections and the low expected fluxes with <lb/>increased size. With this year&apos;s completion of IceCube [1], <lb/>the biggest neutrino detector to date, such an experiment <lb/>is now available. For the experiment a cubic kilometer of <lb/>glacial ice below the geographical South Pole was instru-<lb/>mented with photomultiplier tubes in order to detect the <lb/>Cherenkov light of charged secondaries generated in neu-<lb/>trino interactions. <lb/>During the last 7 austral summers 86 holes were melted <lb/> 2.5 km deep into the ice and into each a cable holding 60 <lb/>so-called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) has been de-<lb/>ployed. The light sensors on 78 of these strings form a <lb/>grid with a horizontal spacing of 125 m and a vertical dis-<lb/>tance of 17 m. As the spacing basically determines the en-<lb/>ergy threshold, the detector center was augmented with the <lb/>denser DeepCore infill array between 2009 and 2010. The <lb/>data-taking started already during the construction phase. <lb/>This work uses data recorded between April 2008 and May <lb/>2009 when 40 strings were operational (IceCube 40). <lb/>IceCube&apos;s main physics goal is the detection of astrophys-<lb/>ical neutrinos at energies above 100 GeV. These neutrinos <lb/>must be isolated from the much larger flux of leptons cre-<lb/>ated in cosmic ray induced air showers [2]. Among these <lb/>a huge number of muons originating mostly from pion and <lb/>kaon decays form the biggest part of the background. In <lb/>the same air showers also atmospheric neutrinos are cre-<lb/>ated [3]. In order to separate them from the astrophysical <lb/>neutrinos a good understanding of their energy spectrum, <lb/>flavour ratios and angular distribution will be helpful. This <lb/>in turn is tightly coupled to our knowledge of the cosmic <lb/>ray composition and hadronic interactions at energies that <lb/>are out of reach of accelerator experiments. <lb/>The atmospheric neutrino spectrum is expected to consist <lb/>of two components, the conventional flux from decaying <lb/>pions and kaons [4, 5] and the prompt neutrinos from de-<lb/>cays of short lived charmed mesons [6, 7]. The existing <lb/>flux predictions for the latter vary widely and current mea-<lb/>surements of the muon neutrino flux [8] are not yet able <lb/>to resolve any prompt from the conventional component <lb/>(see Fig. 1). Compared to muon neutrinos the flux of at-<lb/>mospheric electron neutrinos is lower and falls with a sim-<lb/>ilar steep power law. Taking advantage of the lower en-<lb/>ergy threshold of the DeepCore array, IceCube has recently <lb/></body>

However, at TeV energies <lb/>this measurement remains challenging, and only recently <lb/>an analysis on the same IceCube 40 dataset started to find <lb/>several promising candidate events [10]. In the energy <lb/>spectrum of neutrino induced particle showers the prompt <lb/>component is expected to emerge from the conventional at <lb/>about 10 <lb/> 5  GeV which is about an order of magnitude lower <lb/>than for muon neutrinos (see Fig. 1 and [11]). This makes <lb/>shower events a suitable tool to isolate the prompt compo-<lb/>nent. <lb/> 2 Neutrino Induced Particle Showers <lb/> The events of interest in this study are particle showers <lb/>emerging from deep-inelastic neutrino nucleon scattering. <lb/>Particle showers can be found in the final states of charged <lb/>current (CC) electron and tau neutrino interactions and in <lb/>all neutral current (NC) interactions. Since IceCube can-<lb/>not distinguish ν  e  and low-energy ν  τ  CC interactions from <lb/>all-flavour NC interactions, analyses tailored to this event <lb/>signature are effectively sensitive to all neutrino flavours. <lb/>In NC interactions neutrinos deposit only parts of their en-<lb/>ergy so they show up as less energetic cascades. This leads <lb/>to a lower effective area for muon neutrinos. <lb/>At TeV energies the particle showers have lengths of a few <lb/>meters. But due to the large DOM spacing and the scatter-<lb/>ing of light in the ice showers appear as nearly point-like <lb/>light sources. This results in spherical hit patterns which at <lb/>higher energies appear significantly different from the hit <lb/>patterns of muon tracks. <lb/>The separation from the muonic background is mostly im-<lb/>peded by the fact that high energetic muons stochasti-<lb/>cally undergo catastrophic energy losses in the form of <lb/>bremsstrahlung showers along the track. Because of the <lb/>considerable energy deposition these bright electromag-<lb/>netic showers change the appearance of the track and make <lb/>them less distinguishable from the searched signal. This <lb/>has also a connection to the cosmic ray composition be-<lb/>cause proton air showers produce more often single highly <lb/>energetic muons than for e.g. iron showers. From the lat-<lb/>ter often whole bundles of muons reach the detector and <lb/>traverse the detector nearly in parallel. As the individual <lb/>muons will have their stochastic energy losses at different <lb/>positions, the whole bundle appears sufficiently different <lb/>from a single particle shower and is easier to reject. Exten-<lb/>sive simulations performed in the context of similar anal-<lb/>yses done on the IceCube 22 dataset confirmed this effect <lb/>albeit with low statistics. Those muons which passed all <lb/>cuts were originating from proton air showers [12]. <lb/>For electromagnetic showers the light yield scales lin-<lb/>early with energy. It has been shown in a Monte Carlo <lb/>study that for electron neutrino interactions with energies <lb/>of 10 TeV-1 PeV and well contained interaction vertices <lb/>the energy may be reconstructed with a precision of about <lb/> Δ log  10  (E  ν  ) = 0.13 [17]. <lb/> 3 Event Selection <lb/> In order to minimize statistical bias a blind analysis is per-<lb/>formed. From the 364 days of usable data, 32 days are <lb/>chosen to develop the event selection. The data was sam-<lb/>pled uniformly over the year in order to reflect seasonal <lb/>variations in the muonic background rate. Secondly, a <lb/>large background sample of simulated muons from more <lb/>than 10 <lb/> 12  air showers were generated. A version of COR-<lb/>SIKA [13] with the Sibyll interaction model was adapted <lb/>for IceCube and used to simulate the Hörandel polygonato <lb/>cosmic ray spectrum [14]. Additionally more statistics of <lb/>protons are currently produced in order to study the impact <lb/>of composition uncertainties on the background prediction. <lb/>For the expected signal interactions electron, muon and tau <lb/>neutrinos were generated with a collaboration-internal sim-<lb/>ulation package that is based on ANIS [15]. <lb/>The IceCube 40 detector operated at a trigger rate of about <lb/> 1300 Hz. An online event selection based on two quickly <lb/>calculable variables selected events at a rate of 16 Hz. A <lb/>straight line fit through all hit DOMs at position x  i  and <lb/>time t  i  yields a parametrization of the form x  i  = x  0  + <lb/> v · (t  i  − t  0  ) where the parameter | v| denotes how fast the <lb/>hit pattern evolves. The second variable uses an analogy <lb/>to classical mechanics in which it interprets the hit pattern <lb/>as a rigid body and the recorded amount of light in each <lb/>DOM as a mass. Spherical hit patterns can then be selected <lb/>by calculating the eigenvalues of the tensor of inertia and <lb/>requiring that all three eigenvalues are nearly of the same <lb/>size. This online filter starts to get efficient above an energy <lb/>threshold of about 1 TeV and is optimized for the search for <lb/>the expected astrophysical E <lb/> −2  flux for which it yields an <lb/>efficiency of about 73%. For the less energetic atmospheric <lb/>electron neutrino flux the efficiency is only about 35%. <lb/></body>

			<body> The selected events were transmitted via satellite to insti-<lb/>tutes in the North where more elaborate track and vertex <lb/>likelihood reconstructions can be performed. They provide <lb/>a sufficient angular resolution for incident muons and with <lb/>the likelihood value of the vertex reconstruction a quality <lb/>parameter to select particle showers. Based on the vertex <lb/>reconstruction also an energy estimator that considers the <lb/>depth dependent optical properties of the ice [16] is run. <lb/>Cuts based on these variables reduce the data rate to 2 Hz <lb/>while keeping about 60% of the atmospheric ν  e  signal. Ac-<lb/>cording to a predicted atmospheric neutrino flux [5] the <lb/>sample contains at this point about 1200 ν  e  and 10000 ν  μ <lb/> (CC+NC) events which are still buried below 50 · 10 <lb/> 6  at-<lb/>mospheric muon events. The effective areas up to this cut <lb/>level are shown in Fig. 2. <lb/>All passing events are fed into a more elaborate likelihood <lb/>reconstruction [17]. This takes into account the full timing <lb/>and amplitude information of the recorded light as well as <lb/>tabulated results of detailed simulations of how light prop-<lb/>agates in the ice [18]. For showers this provides estimates <lb/>for the time and position of the interaction as well as the <lb/>amount of deposited energy. Also the track reconstruction <lb/>is repeated with an iterative optimization strategy in order <lb/>to avoid local minima of the likelihood and to improve the <lb/>angular resolution for background events [19]. <lb/>So-called split reconstructions, which split the recorded <lb/>photons by time into two sets and reconstruct each set indi-<lb/>vidually, provide further information about the event due to <lb/>the different timing behaviour of tracks and showers. For <lb/>a track, later hits are downstream along the track while for <lb/>particle showers they are centered around the vertex but at <lb/>larger distance. <lb/>Based on an argument that shower induced hit patterns <lb/>should be spherical another cut variable can be constructed. <lb/>For an imaginary sphere with a given radius and centered <lb/>at the reconstructed vertex one can calculate the fill ra-<lb/>tio N  hit  /N  sphere  , where N  sphere  denotes the number of <lb/>all DOMs in the sphere and N  hit  the number of triggered <lb/>DOMs. This is especially useful to reject events containing <lb/>several coincident atmospheric muons because the hit pat-<lb/>terns of e.g. two coincident but well separated tracks can <lb/>have many untriggered DOMs in between. <lb/>In order to further reduce the muonic background, DOMs <lb/>at the surface of the instrumented volume are used to veto <lb/>tracks that appear to enter and traverse the detector. Events <lb/>for which the first triggered light sensor is located on the <lb/>outer layer of the detector are rejected. Together with the <lb/>requirement that the reconstructed vertex is located inside <lb/>the fiducial volume, this forms a strict containment cut. <lb/>Finally those variables that still provide separation power <lb/>are combined with a machine learning algorithm. In the <lb/>TMVA framework [20] a boosted decision tree is trained <lb/>which provides a final cut variable to select particle show-<lb/>ers. Current investigations suggest that this event selection <lb/>is able to remove the remaining background while keep-<lb/>ing the prospect to find a few atmospheric neutrinos in the <lb/>whole sample. <lb/> 2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/> log 10 (E ν /GeV) <lb/> 10 -3 <lb/> 10 -2 <lb/> 10 -1 <lb/> 10 0 <lb/> 10 1 <lb/> 10 2 <lb/> 10 3 <lb/> 10 4 <lb/> A <lb/> eff /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> preliminary <lb/> ν e (CC+NC) <lb/>trigger level <lb/>filter level <lb/>level 3 <lb/>2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 <lb/> log 10 (E ν /GeV) <lb/> 10 -3 <lb/> 10 -2 <lb/> 10 -1 <lb/> 10 0 <lb/> 10 1 <lb/> 10 2 <lb/> 10 3 <lb/> 10 4 <lb/> A <lb/> eff /m <lb/> 2 <lb/> preliminary <lb/> ν μ (CC+NC) <lb/>trigger level <lb/>filter level <lb/>level 3 <lb/> Figure 2: Effective areas for electron and muon neutrinos <lb/>for the early stages of the analysis. The width of the bands <lb/>denotes the statistical error. This differs between cut levels <lb/>because datasets of different size have been used. The peak <lb/>at 6.3 PeV for electron neutrinos is due to the Glashow res-<lb/>onance. The drop in effective area for muon neutrinos be-<lb/>tween trigger and online filter level illustrates the effect of <lb/>tailoring the analysis to neutrino induced particle showers. <lb/>At the presented cut levels the contribution of muon tracks <lb/>from charged current interactions is still present. Therefore <lb/>the effective area is still higher for muon than for electron <lb/>neutrinos. <lb/>However, this statement relies on the Monte Carlo back-<lb/>ground prediction which has to be scrutinized before un-<lb/>blinding. Accordingly, studies of the systematic uncertain-<lb/>ties in the simulated background sample (like for example <lb/>a lighter cosmic ray composition) are ongoing and will be <lb/>presented together with the final event selection at the con-<lb/>ference. <lb/></body>
