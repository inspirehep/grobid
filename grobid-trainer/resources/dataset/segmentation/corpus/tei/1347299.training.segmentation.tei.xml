			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> In 2000 the centre-of-mass energies reached by LEP ranged from 204 GeV to 208 GeV, <lb/>and the DELPHI experiment collected an integrated luminosity of 223.53 pb <lb/> −1  . The <lb/>data were analysed to update the searches for sleptons, sgoldstinos and heavy stable <lb/>charged particles in the context of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) <lb/>models [1, 2]. <lb/>Once Supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, the gravitino ( ˜ <lb/> G) can acquire a mass <lb/>by absorbing the degrees of freedom of the goldstino [3]. In GMSB models <lb/>  is the lightest <lb/>supersymmetric particle (LSP) and the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) <lb/>can be either the neutralino ( ˜ <lb/> χ <lb/> 0 <lb/> 1  ) or the sleptons ( ˜ l) [4]. In the search for sleptons, the <lb/>data were analysed under the assumption that the NLSP is a slepton, and in particular <lb/>two scenarios were considered, the <lb/>  1  NLSP (˜ τ  1 <lb/> ±  → τ <lb/> ±  ˜ <lb/> G) and the sleptons co-NLSP <lb/>( ˜ l  R <lb/> ±  → l <lb/> ±  ˜ <lb/> G) scenarios. <lb/>Due to the coupling of the NLSP tõ <lb/> G, the mean decay length ( ˆ <lb/> L) of the former can <lb/>range from micrometres to metres depending on the mass of the gravitino (m  ˜ <lb/> G  ): <lb/>ˆ <lb/> L = 1.76 × 10 <lb/> −3 <lb/>  E  ˜ l <lb/> m  ˜ l <lb/>  2 <lb/> − 1 <lb/> m  ˜ l <lb/> 100 GeV/c <lb/> 2 <lb/>  −5  m  ˜ <lb/> G <lb/> 1 eV/c  2 <lb/>  2 <lb/> cm <lb/>(1) <lb/>For example, for m  ˜ <lb/> G  250 eV/c <lb/> 2  , or equivalently, for a SUSY breaking scale of <lb/> √ <lb/> F <lb/> 1000 TeV (since both parameters are related [5]), the decay of a NLSP with mass greater <lb/>than for example 60 GeV/c <lb/> 2  can take place within the detector. This range of <lb/> √ <lb/> F is in <lb/>fact consistent with astrophysical and cosmological considerations [6]. <lb/>The first search presented in the note concerns   pair production followed by the decay <lb/>of each slepton into a lepton and a gravitino: <lb/> e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → ˜ l <lb/> +  ˜ l <lb/> −  → l <lb/> +  ˜ <lb/> Gl <lb/> −  ˜ <lb/> G <lb/> (2) <lb/>If the decay length is too short (1 eV/c <lb/> 2 <lb/>  m  ˜ <lb/> G  10 eV/c <lb/> 2  ) to allow the reconstruction <lb/>of the slepton, only the corresponding lepton or its decay products will be seen in the <lb/>detector, and the search will then be based on the track impact parameter. If the slepton <lb/>decays inside the tracking devices (10 eV/c <lb/> 2 <lb/>  m  ˜ <lb/> G  1000 eV/c <lb/> 2  ), the signature will be <lb/>at least one track of a charged particle with a kink or a decay vertex. However, for very <lb/>heavy gravitinos (m  ˜ <lb/> G  1000 eV/c <lb/> 2  ), the decay length is large and the slepton decays <lb/>outside the detector. The pair production of such long-lived or stable particles yields <lb/>a characteristic signature with typically two back-to-back charged heavy objects in the <lb/>detector. Finally, for very light gravitino masses (m  ˜ <lb/> G  1 eV/c <lb/> 2  ), the decay takes place <lb/>in the primary vertex and the results from the search for sleptons in gravity mediated <lb/>(MSUGRA) models can be applied. <lb/>Heavy stable charged particles are predicted not only in GMSB models but also in <lb/>Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Models (MSSM) with a very small amount of R-parity <lb/>violation, or with R-parity conservation if the mass difference between the LSP and the <lb/>NLSP becomes very small. In these models the LSP can be a charged slepton or a squark <lb/>and decay with a long lifetime into Standard Model particles [7]. The typical signature <lb/>of these events are two massive particles traversing the detector which do not produce <lb/>Cherenkov radiation in DELPHI&apos;s Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors, but high <lb/>ionization losses in the Time Projection Chamber. Updated lower mass limits on heavy <lb/></body>

			<body> stable charged particles, under the assumption that the LSP is a charged slepton, will be <lb/>provided in this note within both models, GMSB and MSSM. <lb/>Recently it has been pointed out [8] that an appropriate theory must contain also the <lb/>supersymmetric partner of the goldstino called sgoldstino which could be massive. In the <lb/>minimal R-parity conserving model, as considered in [8], the effective theory at the weak <lb/>scale contains two neutral scalar states: S, CP-even and P , CP-odd (from now on the two <lb/>states will be labelled with the generic symbol φ since the discussion applies to both of <lb/>them). It must be pointed out that sgoldstinos have R-even parity, therefore they are not <lb/>necessarily produced in pairs and their decay chains do not necessarily contain an LSP. <lb/>The production of these particles may be relevant at LEP2 energies in light gravitino <lb/>scenarios. One of the most interesting production channels is the process e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → φγ <lb/> which depends on the φ mass (m  φ  ) and on <lb/> √ <lb/> F . The most relevant φ decay modes are <lb/> φ → γγ and φ → gg. The corresponding branching ratios depend on the gaugino masses <lb/> M  1  , M  2  and M  3  , and the total width is Γ ∼ Γ(φ → γγ) + Γ(φ → gg). In this note two <lb/>sets for these parameters as suggested in [8] are considered and listed in Table 1. <lb/> M  1  M  2  M  3  BR(φ → γγ) BR(φ → gg) <lb/> 1) 200 300 400 <lb/>4% <lb/>96% <lb/>2) 350 350 350 <lb/>11% <lb/>89% <lb/>Table 1: Two choices for the gaugino mass parameters (in GeV/c <lb/> 2  ) relevant for the <lb/>sgoldstino production and decay, and the corresponding branching ratios (BR) of the two <lb/>considered channels. <lb/>The total width for a large interval of the parameter space is narrow (below a few <lb/>GeV/c <lb/> 2  ), except for the region with small <lb/> √ <lb/> F where also the production cross section is <lb/>expected to be very large. The two considered decay channels produce events with very <lb/>different topologies. The channel φ → γγ gives events with three high energy photons, <lb/>one of which with energy E  γ  = <lb/> s−m  2 <lb/> φ <lb/> 2 <lb/> √ s <lb/> for the large fraction of the parameter space where <lb/> φ has a negligible width. Despite the lower φ decay branching ratio (4 and 11% for the <lb/>two sets of Table 1, respectively), this final state is worth investigating because the main <lb/>background source is the QED e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → γγ(γ) process, which is expected to be small if <lb/>photons in the forward region are discarded. On the other hand, the channel S → gg gives <lb/>events with one monochromatic photon (except for the region with small <lb/> √ <lb/> F ) and two <lb/>jets. An irreducible background from e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → q ¯ <lb/> qγ events is associated to this topology <lb/>and therefore the signal must be searched for as an excess of events over the background <lb/>expectations for every mass hypothesis. <lb/>The data samples are described in section 2. The efficiencies of the different selection <lb/>criteria and the number of events selected in data and in the Standard Model (SM) <lb/>background are reported in 3. Finally, the results are presented in section 4. <lb/> 2 Data sample and event generators <lb/> The analysis is based on data collected with the DELPHI detector during 2000 at <lb/>centre-of-mass energies from 204 to 208 GeV. The total integrated luminosity analysed is <lb/>223.53 pb <lb/> −1  . A detailed description of the DELPHI detector can be found in [9] and the <lb/>detector performance in [10]. <lb/></body>

			<body> To evaluate the signal efficiencies and background contamination, events were genera-<lb/>ted using different programs, all relying on JETSET 7.4 [11], tuned to LEP 1 data [12] for <lb/>quark fragmentation. <lb/>Slepton pair samples at 208 GeV centre-of-mass energy were produced with PYTHIA <lb/> 5.7[11] with staus having a mean decay length from 0.25 to 200 cm and masses from 60 <lb/>to 104 GeV/c <lb/> 2  . <lb/>Other samples of slepton pairs were produced with at 206 and 208 GeV with <lb/> SUSYGEN [13] for the small impact parameter search with m  ˜ <lb/> τ  from 90 GeV/c <lb/> 2  to <lb/>102 GeV/c <lb/> 2  , and m  ˜ <lb/> µ  equal to 90 GeV/c <lb/> 2  . <lb/>For the search for heavy stable charged particles, signal efficiencies were estimated <lb/>from pair produced heavy smuons, generated at energies of 205 GeV and 206.7 GeV <lb/>and 208 GeV with SUSYGEN. The events were passed through the detector simulation <lb/>as heavy muons. The efficiencies were estimated for masses between 10 GeV/c <lb/> 2  and <lb/>100 GeV/c <lb/> 2  (1000 events were generated per mass point). <lb/>For the sgoldstino search, signal efficiencies were estimated from samples obtained as <lb/>explained in [14]. <lb/>The background process e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → q ¯ <lb/> q(nγ) was generated with PYTHIA 6.125, while <lb/> KORALZ 4.2 [15] was used for µ <lb/> +  µ <lb/> −  (γ) and τ <lb/> +  τ <lb/> −  (γ). The generator BHWIDE [16] was <lb/>used for e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  → e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  events. <lb/>Processes leading to four-fermion final states were generated using EXCALIBUR <lb/>1.08 [17] and GRC4F [18]. <lb/>Two-photon interactions leading to hadronic final states were generated using <lb/> TWOGAM [19], including the VDM, QPM and QCD components. The generators of Berends, <lb/>Daverveldt and Kleiss [20] were used for the leptonic final states. <lb/>The cosmic radiation background was studied using the data collected before the <lb/>beginning of the 2000 LEP run. <lb/>The generated signal and background events were passed through the detailed simu-<lb/>lation [10] of the DELPHI detector and then processed with the same reconstruction and <lb/>analysis programs used for real data. <lb/> 3 Data selection <lb/> 3.1 Slepton pair production <lb/> This section describes the update of the search for slepton pair production as a <lb/>function of the mean decay length. The details of the selection criteria used to search for <lb/>the topologies obtained when the NLSP decays inside the detector volume were described <lb/>in [21, 22]. The efficiencies were derived for different   masses and decay lengths by <lb/>applying the same selection to the simulated signal events. <lb/> 3.1.1 Search for secondary vertices <lb/> This analysis exploits a feature of the   → l ˜ <lb/> G topology when the slepton decays inside <lb/>the tracking devices, namely, one or two tracks originating from the interaction point and <lb/>at least one of them with a secondary vertex or a kink. <lb/>The secondary vertex reconstruction procedure was sensitive to radial decay lengths <lb/>(R) between 20 cm and 90 cm. The Vertex detector and the Inner detector were needed <lb/></body>

			<body> to reconstruct the <lb/>  and the Time Projection Chamber to reconstruct the decay products. <lb/>The shape of the efficiency distribution was quite flat as a function of R decreasing when <lb/>the <lb/>  decayed near the outer surface of the Time Projection Chamber. The decrease was <lb/>due to inefficiencies in the reconstruction of the tracks coming from the decay products <lb/>of the τ . Figure 1-a shows the efficiency distribution as a function of the decay radius <lb/>for <lb/>  masses between 60 and 90 GeV/c <lb/> 2  and <lb/>  = 50 cm. The same selection criteria <lb/>were applied to smuons and selectrons. The efficiency, within the same range of decay <lb/>radius, was around 60% (40%) for m  ˜ <lb/> µ  R  (m  ˜ <lb/> e  R  ) between 60 to 90 GeV/c <lb/> 2  . The efficiency for <lb/>selectrons was lower than for staus or smuons due to an upper cut on total electromagnetic <lb/>energy at the preselection level. <lb/>After applying the selection criteria to search for this topology, two events in real <lb/>data were found to satisfy all the requirements, while 0.94 <lb/> +1.12 <lb/> −0.28  were expected from SM <lb/>backgrounds. <lb/> 3.1.2 Large impact parameter search <lb/> To investigate the region of lower gravitino masses the previous search was extended <lb/>to the case of sleptons with mean decay length between 0.25 cm and approximately 10 cm. <lb/>In this case the   is not reconstructed and only the l (or the decay products in the case <lb/>of <lb/>  ) is detected. The impact parameter search was applied to those events accepted by <lb/>the same general requirements as in the search for secondary vertices, and not selected <lb/>by the secondary vertex analysis. <lb/>The maximum efficiency was around 32% corresponding to a mean decay length of <lb/>2.5 cm. The efficiency decreased sharply for lower decay lengths due to the requirement on <lb/>minimum impact parameter. For longer decay lengths, the appearance of reconstructed <lb/>  in combination with the cut on the maximum number of charged particles in the event <lb/>caused the efficiency to decrease smoothly. This decrease is compensated by a rising <lb/>efficiency in the search for secondary vertices. For masses above 60 GeV/c <lb/> 2  no dependence <lb/>on the <lb/>  mass was found far from the kinematic limit. <lb/>The same selection was applied to smuons and selectrons. For smuons the efficiency <lb/>increased to ∼ 58% for a mean decay length of 2.5 cm and masses over 60 GeV/c <lb/> 2  since <lb/>the smuon always has a one-prong decay. For selectrons the efficiency was ∼ 33% for the <lb/>same mean decay length and range of masses. Figure 1-b shows the efficiency distribution <lb/>as a function of the mean decay length for staus, smuons and selectrons. The contribution <lb/>of the kink and large impact parameter searches is shown. <lb/>Trigger efficiencies were studied simulating the DELPHI trigger response to the events <lb/>selected by the vertex search and by the large impact parameter analysis, and were found <lb/>to be around 99%. <lb/>Two events in the real data sample were selected, while 2.40 <lb/> +1.49 <lb/> −0.45  were expected from <lb/>SM backgrounds. <lb/> 3.1.3 Small impact parameter search <lb/> The large impact parameter search can be extended further to mean decay lengths <lb/>below 0.1 cm. The integrated luminosity used in this search is 164.5 pb <lb/> −1  between 204 <lb/>and 208 GeV center-of-mass energies. The analysis is essentially the same as described in <lb/>detail in previous publications [21, 22], with the addition of the tightening of the cut on the <lb/></body>

			<body> quality of the fastest track. The filter has been applied to the search for long lived <lb/>  and <lb/> . The impact parameters, b  1  and b  2  , of the two leading tracks in low multiplicity events <lb/>are used to discriminate against the SM background. Requiring <lb/> b <lb/> 2 <lb/>1  + b <lb/> 2 <lb/>2  ≥ 600 µm the <lb/>efficiency depends little on the slepton mass and it can be parameterized as a function of <lb/>the slepton decay length in the laboratory system. The efficiency for <lb/>  detection reaches <lb/> ∼ 40% for decay lengths around 2 cm, is still 16% for a decay length of 0.1 cm, and 13% <lb/>for 20 cm. The efficiency for <lb/>  detection reaches 45% around 2 cm, 15% at 0.1 cm, and <lb/>17% at 20 cm. <lb/>With this selection the number of expected SM background events is 3.3 ± 0.3, and <lb/>the number of candidates in the data is 4, compatible with the expected SM background. <lb/> 3.1.4 Heavy Stable Charged particles search <lb/> The analysis described in [21, 23] has been applied to the data taken during 2000. The <lb/>data set has been subdivided into 3 energy bins, corresponding to energies below 206 GeV <lb/>(85 pb <lb/> −1  ), between 206 GeV and 207 GeV (124 pb <lb/> −1  ), and above 207 GeV (11.4 pb <lb/> −1  ). A <lb/>careful run selection ensured that the RICH detectors were fully operational because the <lb/>method used to identify heavy stable particles relies on the lack of Cherenkov radiation <lb/>in DELPHI&apos;s RICH detectors. Signal efficiencies were estimated from Monte Carlo by <lb/>simulating heavy sleptons with SUSYGEN and passing them through the detector simulation <lb/>as heavy muons. The total background of 0.25±0.04 events was estimated from data <lb/>itself by counting the number of tracks passing the individual selection criteria. Only <lb/>events with two or three charged particles were considered. Events were selected, if they <lb/>contained at least one charged particle with: <lb/>1. a momentum above 5 GeV/c, a high ionization loss and no photons in the gas <lb/>radiator were associated to the particle (gas veto) or, <lb/>2. a momentum above 15 GeV/c, an ionization loss at least 0.3 below the expectation <lb/>for a proton and surviving the gas veto or, <lb/>3. a momentum above 15 GeV/c, surviving the gas and the liquid RICH veto. <lb/>An event was also selected if both event hemispheres contained particles with both either <lb/>a high ionization loss or a gas veto, or both having a low ionization loss. Special care <lb/>has been taken about the dE/dx in sector 6 (S6) of the Time Projection Chamber which <lb/>died during the second half of data taking, reducing the efficiency of the search by several <lb/>percent as the dE/dx search windows could not be applied to tracks pointing to S6. To <lb/>recover some sensitivity for tracks pointing to S6, only the double veto search window <lb/>was applied, requiring hits in the Vertex Detector, Inner Detector and Outer Detector to <lb/>ensure a good propagation of the tracks through the RICH. <lb/>No candidate events were selected in data. Figure 2 show the data and the three <lb/>main search windows. The expectation for a 90 GeV/c <lb/> 2  mass signal is also shown. For <lb/>particle masses below 60 GeV/c <lb/> 2  the signal efficiencies are of the order of 30% and rise <lb/>with increasing mass to about 76-78%. Then the efficiency drops when approaching the <lb/>kinematical limit due to saturation effects, and it is assumed to be zero at the kinematical <lb/>limit. <lb/></body>

			<body> 3.2 Sgoldstino search <lb/> 3.2.1 <lb/> φ → γγ channel <lb/> The selection criteria applied in the search for γγγ topologies were the same reported <lb/>in [14] where all the selection cuts are optimized to find three high energy photons one of <lb/>them monochromatic. <lb/>No significant variation in the polar acceptance for a φγ signal and in the selection <lb/>efficiency inside the acceptance region were observed in the 2000 data with respect to <lb/>previous values: polar acceptance=(51 ± 2)% and efficiency = (76.6 ± 2.5)%. As ex-<lb/>plained in [14], the polar acceptance was evaluated by generating 4-vectors corresponding <lb/>to the prompt photon and to the φ decay products, and applying the following polar cut: <lb/>42 <lb/> •  &lt; θ &lt; 89 <lb/> •  (High Projection Chamber acceptance), and 25 <lb/> •  &lt; θ &lt; 32.4 <lb/> •  (Forward <lb/>Electromagnetic Calorimeter acceptance). As in [14], the photon energies are determined <lb/>with a good precision from their measured directions and the energy resolution was eval-<lb/>uated by means of the QED background events generated according to [24]. This energy <lb/>resolution was found to be better than 0.5% in the whole photon energy range, as in the <lb/>previous years. The photon recoil mass spectra obtained for the events collected during <lb/>2000 run and for all the events including those reported in [14] are shown in Figure 3-a. <lb/>The data are superimposed on the expected QED background distribution. <lb/>The number of selected events in data and the expected SM background are 22 and <lb/>20.3 <lb/> +1.5 <lb/> −1.9  , respectively. No significant background was found except for the QED contribu-<lb/>tion. <lb/> 3.2.2 <lb/> φ → gg channel <lb/> This channel is expected to give rise to a final state with one monochromatic pho-<lb/>ton and two jets. Similarly to the γγγ selection, no significant variation in the polar <lb/>acceptance for a φγ signal and in the selection efficiency inside the acceptance region <lb/>were observed in the 2000 data with respect to the previous values: the acceptance is <lb/>(76 ± 2)% and the efficiency ranged from 20 to 55 % depending on the photon energy. <lb/>The energy resolution was also unchanged. The photon recoil mass spectra obtained for <lb/>the events collected during 2000 and previous years are shown in Figure 3-b. The data <lb/>are superimposed on the expected SM background distributions. <lb/>The number of selected events in data and the expected SM background are 766 and <lb/>775 ± 5, respectively. <lb/> 4 Results and interpretation <lb/> Since there was no evidence for a signal above the expected SM background, the <lb/>number of candidates in data and the expected number of background events were used <lb/>to set limits at the 95% confidence level (CL) on the pair production cross-section and <lb/>masses of the sparticles searched for. The limits presented here are at <lb/> √ <lb/> s = 208 GeV after <lb/>combining the results of the searches at lower centre-of-mass energies with the likelihood <lb/>ratio method [25]. <lb/></body>

			<body> 4.1 Slepton pair production <lb/> The results of the search for slepton pair production are presented in the (m  ˜ <lb/> G  ,m  ˜ l  ) <lb/>plane combining the impact parameter, the secondary vertex and the stable heavy lepton <lb/>analyses, and using all DELPHI data from 130 GeV to 208 GeV centre-of-mass energies. <lb/>The <lb/>  1  pair production cross-section depends on the mixing in the stau sector. There-<lb/>fore, in order to put limits on the <lb/>  1  mass the mixing angle had to be fixed. The results <lb/>presented here corresponds to a mixing angle in the stau sector which gives the minimum <lb/>  1  pair production cross-section and at the same time maintains m <lb/> 2 <lb/>˜ <lb/> τ  1  &gt; 0, Figure 4-a. <lb/>Within the <lb/>  1  NLSP scenario, the impact parameter and secondary vertex analyses ex-<lb/>tended the limit m  ˜ <lb/> τ  R  &gt; 82.2 GeV/c <lb/> 2  for m  ˜ <lb/> G  1 eV/c <lb/> 2  , set by MSUGRA searches, <lb/>up to m  ˜ <lb/> G  = 400 eV/c <lb/> 2  , reaching the maximum excluded value of m  ˜ <lb/> τ  R  = 93 GeV/c <lb/> 2  for <lb/> m  ˜ <lb/> G  = 130 eV/c <lb/> 2  . For m  ˜ <lb/> G  &gt; 130 eV/c <lb/> 2  the best lower mass limit was set by the stable <lb/>heavy lepton search. <lb/>Within the sleptons co-NLSP scenario, the cross-section limits were used to derive <lb/>lower limits for   R  (Figure 4-b) masses at 95% CL. Assuming mass degeneracy between <lb/>the sleptons, these searches extended the limit   R  &gt; 89 GeV/c <lb/> 2  set by MSUGRA searches <lb/>for very short NLSP lifetimes, up to m  ˜ <lb/> G  = 700 eV/c <lb/> 2  . For the MSUGRA case no lepton <lb/>combination exists, so the best limit from the <lb/>  R  has been used. The maximum excluded <lb/>value of m  ˜ l  R  = 96.5 GeV/c <lb/> 2  was achieved for m  ˜ <lb/> G  = 150 eV/c <lb/> 2  . For m  ˜ <lb/> G  &gt; 150 eV/c <lb/> 2  the best <lb/>lower mass limit was set by the stable heavy lepton search. ˜ l  R  masses below 35 GeV/c <lb/> 2 <lb/> were excluded by LEP 1 data [26]. In the case of   R  degeneracy, this limit improved to <lb/>41 GeV/c <lb/> 2  . <lb/> 4.2 Heavy stable charged particle pair production <lb/> The results presented in section 3.1.4 were combined with previous DELPHI results <lb/>in this channel, and cross-section limits were derived as indicated in Figure 5. From the <lb/>intersection points with the predicted cross-sections for smuon or staus in the MSSM, <lb/>left(right) handed smuons and staus can be excluded up to masses of 97.4(97.1) GeV/c <lb/> 2 <lb/> at 95% CL. No limits are given on selectrons here, because the cross-section can be highly <lb/>suppressed by an additional t-channel sneutrino exchange contribution. <lb/> 4.3 Sgoldstino production <lb/> No excess of events nor clear evidence of an anomalous production of events with <lb/>monochromatic photons is observed in either of the channels. Therefore a limit on the <lb/>cross-section of the new physics reaction contributing to the two topologies was set. <lb/>Since the expected φ branching ratio and total width depend on the mass parameters <lb/>as explained in [8], the 95% CL cross-section limit was computed as a function of m  φ <lb/> and <lb/> √ <lb/> F for the two sets of parameters listed in Table 1, and is shown in Figure 6. <lb/>By comparing the experimental limits with the expected production cross-section, it is <lb/>possible to determine a 95% CL excluded region on the parameter space as shown in <lb/>Figure 7. As explained in [8], to keep the particle interpretation the total width Γ must <lb/>be much smaller than m  φ  and therefore the region with Γ &gt; 0.5 × m  φ  was not considered. <lb/></body>

			<body> 5 Summary <lb/> Sleptons, sgoldstinos and heavy stable charged particles were searched for in the <lb/>context of light gravitino models. In the case of sleptons two possibilities were explored: <lb/>the <lb/>  1  NLSP and the sleptons co-NLSP scenarios. In the case of heavy stable charged <lb/>particles results within the MSSM interpretation are also given. <lb/>No evidence for signal production was found in any of the searches.
