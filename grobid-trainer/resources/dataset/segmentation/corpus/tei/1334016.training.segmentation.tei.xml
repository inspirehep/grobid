			<front> Krichever–Novikov Type Algebras. An Introduction <lb/> Martin Schlichenmaier <lb/> Abstract. Krichever–Novikov type algebras are generalizations of the Witt, <lb/>Virasoro, affine Lie algebras, and their relatives to Riemann surfaces of ar-<lb/>bitrary genus. We give the most important results about their structure, <lb/>almost-grading and central extensions. This contribution is based on a se-<lb/>quence of introductory lectures delivered by the author at the Southeast Lie <lb/>Theory Workshop 2012 in Charleston, U.S.A. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The Witt algebra and its universal central extension the Virasoro algebra re-<lb/>spectively are in some sense the simplest non-trivial examples of infinite dimensional <lb/>Lie algebras <lb/> 1  . Nevertheless, they already exhibit a very rich algebraic theory of rep-<lb/>resentations. Furthermore, they appear prominently as symmetry algebras of quite <lb/>a number of systems with infinitely many independent degrees of freedom. Their <lb/>appearance in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) [4], [105] is well-known. But this is <lb/>not their only application. At many other places in-and outside of mathematics <lb/>they play an important role. <lb/>The algebras can be given by meromorphic objects on the Riemann sphere <lb/>(genus zero) with possible poles only at {0, ∞}. For the Witt algebra these objects <lb/>are vector fields. More generally one obtains its central extension the Virasoro <lb/>algebra, the current algebras and their central extensions the affine Kac-Moody <lb/>algebras. For Riemann surfaces of higher genus, but still only for two points were <lb/>poles are allowed, they were generalised by Krichever and Novikov [56], [57], [58] <lb/>in 1986. In 1990 the author [77], [78], [79], [80] extended the approach further to <lb/>the general multi-point case. <lb/>These extensions were not at all straight-forward. The main point was to in-<lb/>troduce a replacement of the graded algebra structure present in the &quot; classical &quot; <lb/>case. Krichever and Novikov found that an almost-grading, see Definition 5.1 be-<lb/>low, will be enough to allow for the standard constructions in representation theory. <lb/></body>

			<body> In [79], [80] it was realized that a splitting of the set A of points where poles are <lb/>allowed, into two disjoint non-empty subsets A = I ∪ O is crucial for introduc-<lb/>ing an almost-grading. The corresponding almost-grading was explicitly given. A <lb/>Krichever-Novikov (KN) type algebra is an algebra of meromorphic objects with <lb/>an almost-grading coming from such a splitting. In the classical situation there is <lb/>only one such splitting (up to inversion) possible, Hence, there is only one almost-<lb/>grading, which is indeed a grading. <lb/>From the algebraic point of view these KN type algebras are of course infinite <lb/>dimensional Lie algebras, but they are still defined as (algebraic-)geometric objects. <lb/>This point of view will be very helpful for further examinations. <lb/>As already mentioned above the crucial property is the almost-grading which <lb/>replaces the honest grading in the Witt and Virasoro case. For a number of repre-<lb/>sentation theoretic constructions the almost-grading will be enough. In contrast to <lb/>the classical situation, where there is only one grading, we will have a finite set of <lb/>non-equivalent gradings and new interesting phenomena show up. This is already <lb/>true for the genus zero case (i.e. the Riemann sphere case) with more than two <lb/>points where poles are allowed. These algebras will be only almost-graded, see e.g. <lb/>[81], [29], [30]. <lb/>Quite recently the book Krichever–Novikov type algebras. Theory and applica-<lb/>tions [91] by the author appeared. It gives a more or less complete treatment of <lb/>the state of the art of the theory of KN type algebras including some applications. <lb/>For more applications in direction of integrable systems and description of the Lax <lb/>operator algebras see also the recent book Current algebras on Riemann surfaces <lb/> [102] by Sheinman. <lb/>The goal of the lectures at the workshop and of this extended write-up was <lb/>to give a gentle introduction to the KN type algebras in the multi-point setting, <lb/>their definitions and main properties. Proofs are mostly omitted. They all can be <lb/>found in [91], beside in the original works. KN type algebras carry a very rich <lb/>representation theory. We have Verma modules, highest weight representations, <lb/>Fermionic and Bosonic Fock representations, semi-infinite wedge forms, b − c sys-<lb/>tems, Sugawara representations and vertex algebras. Due to space limitations as <lb/>far as these representations are concerned we are very short here and have to refer <lb/>to [91] too. There also a quite extensive list of references can be found, includ-<lb/>ing articles published by physicist&apos;s on applications in the field theoretical context. <lb/>This review extends and updates in certain respects the previous review [89] and <lb/>has consequently some overlap with it. <lb/>It is a pleasure for me to thank the organisers Iana Anguelova, Ben Cox, Eliz-<lb/>abeth Jurisich, and Oleg Smirnov of the Southeast Lie Theory Workshop 2012 in <lb/>Charleston, for the invitation to this very inspiring activity. Particular thank goes <lb/>also to the audience for their lively feed-back. I acknowledge partial support by <lb/>Internal Research Project GEOMQ11, University of Luxembourg, and in the frame <lb/>of the OPEN scheme of the Fonds National de la Recherche (FNR) with the project <lb/>QUANTMOD O13/570706. <lb/> 2. A Reminder of the Virasoro Algebra and its Relatives <lb/> These algebras are in some sense the simplest non-trivial infinite dimensional <lb/>Lie algebras. For the convenience of the reader we will start by recalling their <lb/>conventional algebraic definitions. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2.1. The Witt algebra. The Witt algebra W , sometimes also called Virasoro <lb/>algebra without central term, is the Lie algebra generated as vector space by the <lb/>basis elements {e  n  | n ∈ Z} with Lie structure <lb/>(2.1) <lb/>[e  n  , e  m  ] = (m − n)e  n+m  , n, m ∈ Z. <lb/> The algebra W is more than just a Lie algebra. It is a graded Lie algebra. If <lb/>we set for the degree deg(e  n  ) := n then <lb/>(2.2) <lb/> W = <lb/> n∈Z <lb/> W  n  , <lb/> W  n  = e  n   C  . <lb/> Obviously, deg([e  n  , e  m  ]) = deg(e  n  ) + deg(e  m  ). <lb/>Algebraically W can also be given as Lie algebra of derivations of the algebra <lb/>of Laurent polynomials C[z, z <lb/> −1  ]. <lb/> Remark 2.1. In the purely algebraic context our field of definition C can be <lb/>replaced by an arbitrary field K of characteristics 0. This concerns all cases in this <lb/>section. <lb/> 2.2. The Virasoro algebra. For the Witt algebra the universal central ex-<lb/>tension is the Virasoro algebra V. As vector space it is the direct sum V = C ⊕ W. <lb/> If we set for x ∈ W, ˆ <lb/> x := (0, x), and t := (1, 0) then its basis elements arê <lb/> e  n  , n ∈ Z <lb/> and t with the Lie product <lb/> 2 <lb/> . <lb/>(2.3) <lb/>[ˆ e  n  , ˆ <lb/> e  m  ] = (m − n)ˆ e  n+m  + <lb/>1 <lb/>12 <lb/>(n <lb/> 3  − n)δ <lb/> −m <lb/> n <lb/> t, <lb/> [ˆ e  n  , t] = [t, t] = 0, <lb/>for all n, m ∈ Z. By setting deg(ˆ e  n  ) := deg(e  n  ) = n and deg(t) := 0 the Lie <lb/>algebra V becomes a graded algebra. The algebra W will only be a subspace, <lb/>not a subalgebra of V. But it will be a quotient. Up to equivalence of central <lb/>extensions and rescaling the central element t, this is beside the trivial (splitting) <lb/>central extension the only central extension of W. <lb/> 2.3. The affine Lie algebra. Given g a finite-dimensional Lie algebra (e.g. <lb/>a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra) then the tensor product of g with the as-<lb/>sociative algebra of Laurent polynomials C[z, z <lb/> −1  ] carries a Lie algebra structure <lb/>via <lb/>(2.4) <lb/>[x ⊗ z <lb/> n  , y ⊗ z <lb/> m  ] := [x, y] ⊗ z <lb/> n+m  . <lb/> This algebra is called current algebra or loop algebra and denoted by g. Again <lb/>we consider central extensions. For this let β be a symmetric, bilinear form for g <lb/> which is invariant (e.g. β([x, y], z) = β(x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z ∈ g). Then a central <lb/>extension is given by <lb/>(2.5) <lb/>[ <lb/> x ⊗ z  n  , <lb/> y ⊗ z  m  ] := <lb/> [x, y] ⊗ z  n+m  − β(x, y) · m δ <lb/> −m <lb/> n <lb/> · t. <lb/> This algebra is denoted by  g and called affine Lie algebra. With respect to the <lb/>classification of Kac-Moody Lie algebras, in the case of a simple g they are exactly <lb/>the Kac-Moody algebras of affine type, [47], [48], [68]. <lb/></body>

			<body> 2.4. The Lie superalgebra. To complete the description I will give introduce <lb/>the Lie superalgebra of Neveu-Schwarz type. The centrally extended superalgebra <lb/>has as basis (we drop theˆ <lb/>(2.6) <lb/> e  n  , n ∈ Z, ϕ  m  , m ∈ Z + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> , t <lb/> with structure equations <lb/>(2.7) <lb/>[e  n  , e  m  ] = (m − n)e  m+n  + <lb/>1 <lb/>12 <lb/>(n <lb/> 3  − n) δ <lb/> −m <lb/> n <lb/> t, <lb/> [e  n  , ϕ  m  ] = (m − <lb/> n <lb/> 2 <lb/>) ϕ  m+n  , <lb/> [ϕ  n  , ϕ  m  ] = e  n+m  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>6 <lb/>(n <lb/> 2  − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/>) δ <lb/> −m <lb/> n <lb/> t. <lb/> By &quot; setting t = 0 &quot; we obtain the non-extended superalgebra. The elements e  n <lb/> (and t) are a basis of the subspace of even elements, the elements ϕ  m  a basis of the <lb/>subspace of odd elements. <lb/>These algebras are indeed Lie superalgebras. For completeness I recall their <lb/>definition here. <lb/> Remark 2.2. ( Definition of a Lie superalgebra). Let S be a vector space which <lb/>is decomposed into even and odd elements S = S¯  0  ⊕ S¯  1  , i.e. S is a Z/2Z-graded <lb/> vector space. Furthermore, let [., .] be a Z/2Z-graded bilinear map S × S → S such <lb/>that for elements x, y of pure parity <lb/>(2.8) <lb/>[x, y] = −(−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> x¯ y  [y, x]. <lb/> Here ¯ <lb/> x is the parity of x, etc. These conditions say that <lb/>(2.9) <lb/>[S¯  0  , S¯  0  ] ⊆ S¯  0  , <lb/> [S¯  0  , S¯  1  ] ⊆ S¯  1  , <lb/> [S¯  1  , S¯  1  ] ⊆ S¯  0  , <lb/> and that [x, y] is symmetric for x and y odd, otherwise anti-symmetric. Now S is a <lb/> Lie superalgebra if in addition the super-Jacobi identity (for x, y, z of pure parity) <lb/>(2.10) <lb/>(−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> x¯ z  [x, [y, z]] + (−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> y ¯ <lb/> x  [y, [z, x]] + (−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> z ¯ <lb/> y  [z, [x, y]] = 0 <lb/>is valid. As long as the type of the arguments is different from (even, odd, odd) all <lb/>signs can be put to +1 and we obtain the form of the usual Jacobi identity. In the <lb/>remaining case we get <lb/>(2.11) <lb/>[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] − [z, [x, y]] = 0. <lb/>By the definitions S  0  is a Lie algebra. <lb/> 3. The Geometric Picture <lb/> In the previous section I gave the Virasoro algebra and its relatives by purely <lb/>algebraic means, i.e. by basis elements and structure equations. The full importance <lb/>and strength will become more visible in a geometric context. Also from these <lb/>geometric realization the need for a generalization as obtained via the Krichever– <lb/>Novikov type algebras will become evident. <lb/></body>

			<body> 3.1. The geometric realisations of the Virasoro algebra. One of its <lb/>realization is as complexification of the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields <lb/> V ect  pol  (S <lb/> 1  ) on the circle S <lb/> 1  . This is a subalgebra of V ect(S <lb/> 1  ), die Lie algebra <lb/>of all C <lb/> ∞  vector fields on the circle. In this realization the basis elements are <lb/>(3.1) <lb/> e  n  := −i exp i nϕ <lb/>d <lb/>dϕ <lb/>, <lb/>n ∈ Z , <lb/> where ϕ is the angle variable. The Lie product is the usual Lie bracket of vector <lb/>fields. <lb/>If we extend analytically these generators to the whole punctured complex <lb/>plane we obtain e  n  = z <lb/> n+1 d <lb/>dz  . This gives another realization of the Witt algebra as <lb/>the algebra of those meromorphic vector fields on the Riemann sphere S <lb/> 2  = P <lb/> 1  (C) <lb/>which are holomorphic outside {0} and {∞}. <lb/> Let z be the (quasi) global coordinate z (quasi, because it is not defined at <lb/> ∞). Let w = 1/z be the local coordinate at ∞. A global meromorphic vector field <lb/> v on P <lb/> 1  (C) will be given on the corresponding subsets where z respectively w are <lb/>defined as <lb/>(3.2) <lb/> v = <lb/> v  1  (z) <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/>, v  2  (w) <lb/> d <lb/>dw <lb/> , <lb/>v  2  (w) = −v  1  (z(w))w <lb/> 2  . <lb/> The function v  1  will determine the vector field v. Hence, we will usually just write <lb/>down v  1  and in fact identify the vector field v with its local representing function <lb/> v  1  , which we will denote by the same letter. <lb/>For the Lie bracket we calculate <lb/>(3.3) <lb/>[v, u] = <lb/> v <lb/>d <lb/>dz <lb/>u − u <lb/>d <lb/>dz <lb/>v <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/>. <lb/> The space of all meromorphic vector fields constitute a Lie algebra. <lb/>The subspace of those meromorphic vector fields which are holomorphic outside <lb/>of {0, ∞} is a Lie subalgebra. Its elements can be given as <lb/>(3.4) <lb/> v(z) = f (z) <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/> where f is a meromorphic function on P <lb/> 1  (C), which is holomorphic outside {0, ∞}. <lb/> Those are exactly the Laurent polynomials C[z, z <lb/> −1  ]. Consequently, this subalgebra <lb/>has the set {e  n  , n ∈ Z} as basis. The Lie product is the same and the subalgebra <lb/>can be identified with the Witt algebra W. The subalgebra of global holomorphic <lb/>vector fields is e  −1  , e  0  , e  1   C  . It is isomorphic to the Lie algebra sl(2, C). <lb/> Similarly, the algebra C[z, z <lb/> −1  ] can be given as the algebra of meromorphic <lb/>functions on S <lb/> 2  = P(C) holomorphic outside of {0, ∞}. <lb/> 3.2. Arbitrary genus generalizations. In the geometric setup for the Vira-<lb/>soro algebra the objects are defined on the Riemann sphere and might have poles at <lb/>most at two fixed points. For a global operator approach to conformal field theory <lb/>and its quantization this is not sufficient. One needs Riemann surfaces of arbitrary <lb/>genus, Moreover, one needs more than two points were singularities are allowed <lb/> 3 <lb/> . <lb/>Such a generalizations were initiated by Krichever and Novikov [56], [57], [58], who <lb/>considered arbitrary genus and the two-point case. As far as the current algebras <lb/></body>

The multi-point case was <lb/>systematically examined by the author [77], [78], [79], [80], [81] [82], [83], [84]. <lb/>For some related approach see also Sadov [76]. <lb/>For the whole contribution let Σ be a compact Riemann surface without any <lb/>restriction for the genus g = g(Σ). Furthermore, let A be a finite subset of Σ. <lb/>Later we will need a splitting of A into two non-empty disjoint subsets I and O, i.e. <lb/> A = I ∪ O. Set N := #A, K := #I, M := #O, with N = K + M . More precisely, <lb/>let <lb/>(3.5) <lb/> I = (P  1  , . . . , P  K  ), and O = (Q  1  , . . . , Q  M  ) <lb/>be disjoint ordered tuples of distinct points ( &quot; marked points &quot; , &quot; punctures &quot; ) on the <lb/>Riemann surface. In particular, we assume P  i  = Q  j  for every pair (i, j). The <lb/>points in I are called the in-points, the points in O the out-points. Occasionally we <lb/>consider I and O simply as sets. <lb/>Sometimes we refer to the classical situation. By this we understand <lb/>(3.6) <lb/>Σ = P <lb/> 1  (C) = S <lb/> 2  , I = {z = 0}, O = {z = ∞}, <lb/> and the situation considered in Section 3.1. <lb/>The following figures should indicate the geometric picture. Figure 1 shows the <lb/>classical situation. Figure 2 is genus 2, but still two-point situation. Finally, in <lb/>Figure 3 the case of a Riemann surface of genus 2 with two incoming points and <lb/>one outgoing point is visualized. <lb/> Remark 3.1. We stress the fact, that these generalizations are needed also in <lb/>the case of genus zero if one considers more than two points. Even there in the case <lb/>of three points interesting algebras show up. <lb/></body>

To introduce the elements of the generalised al-<lb/>gebras we first have to discuss forms of of certain (conformal) weights. Recall that <lb/>Σ is a compact Riemann surface of genus g ≥ 0. Let A be a fixed finite subset of Σ. <lb/>In fact we could allow for this and the following sections (as long as we do not talk <lb/>about almost-grading) that A is an arbitrary subset. This includes the extremal <lb/>cases A = ∅ or A = Σ. <lb/>Let K = K  Σ  be the canonical line bundle of Σ. Its local sections are the <lb/>local holomorphic differentials. If P ∈ Σ is a point and z a local holomorphic <lb/>coordinate at P then a local holomorphic differential can be written as f (z)dz <lb/>with a local holomorphic function f defined in a neighbourhood of P . A global <lb/>holomorphic section can be described locally in coordinates (U  i  , z  i  )  i∈J  by a system <lb/>of local holomorphic functions (f  i  )  i∈J  , which are related by the transformation rule <lb/>induced by the coordinate change map z  j  = z  j  (z  i  ) and the condition f  i  dz  i  = f  j  dz  j  . <lb/>This yields <lb/>(3.7) <lb/> f  j  = f  i  · <lb/> dz  j <lb/> dz  i <lb/>  −1 <lb/> . <lb/> A meromorphic section of K, i.e. a meromorphic differential is given as a collec-<lb/>tion of local meromorphic functions (h  i  )  i∈J  with respect to a coordinate covering <lb/>for which the transformation law (3.7) is true. We will not make any distinction <lb/>between the canonical bundle and its sheaf of sections, which is a locally free sheaf <lb/>of rank 1. <lb/>In the following λ is either an integer or a half-integer. If λ is an integer then <lb/>(1) K <lb/> λ  = K <lb/> ⊗λ  for λ &gt; 0, <lb/>(2) K <lb/> 0  = O, the trivial line bundle, and <lb/>(3) K <lb/> λ  = (K <lb/>  *  ) <lb/> ⊗(−λ)  for λ &lt; 0. <lb/>Here K <lb/>  *  denotes the dual line bundle of the canonical line bundle. This is the <lb/>holomorphic tangent line bundle, whose local sections are the holomorphic tangent <lb/>vector fields f (z)(d/dz). <lb/>If λ is a half-integer, then we first have to fix a &quot; square root &quot; of the canonical line <lb/>bundle, sometimes called a theta characteristics. This means we fix a line bundle <lb/> L for which L <lb/> ⊗2  = K. After such a choice of L is done we set K <lb/> λ  := K <lb/> λ <lb/>L  := L <lb/> ⊗2λ  . <lb/>In most cases we will drop the mentioning of L, but we have to keep the choice in <lb/>mind. The fine-structure of the algebras we are about to define will depend on the <lb/>choice. But the main properties will remain the same. <lb/> Remark 3.2. A Riemann surface of genus g has exactly 2 <lb/> 2g  non-isomorphic <lb/>square roots of K. For g = 0 we have K = O(−2), and L = O(−1), the tautological <lb/>bundle, is the unique square root. Already for g = 1 we have four non-isomorphic <lb/></body>

			<body> ones. As in this case K = O one solution is L  0  = O. But we have also other bundles <lb/> L  i  , i = 1, 2, 3. Note that L  0  has a nonvanishing global holomorphic section, whereas <lb/>this is not the case for L  1  , L  2  and L  3  . In general, depending on the parity of the <lb/>dimension of the space of globally holomorphic sections, i.e. dim H <lb/> 0  (Σ, L), one <lb/>distinguishes even and odd theta characteristics L. For g = 1 the bundle O is an <lb/>odd, the others are even theta characteristics. The choice of a theta characteristic <lb/>is also called a spin structure on Σ [3]. <lb/>We set <lb/>(3.8) <lb/> F <lb/> λ  (A) := {f is a global meromorphic section of K <lb/> λ  | <lb/> f is holomorphic on Σ \ A}. <lb/> Obviously this is a C-vector space. To avoid cumbersome notation, we will often <lb/>drop the set A in the notation if A is fixed and/or clear from the context. Recall <lb/>that in the case of half-integer λ everything depends on the theta characteristic L. <lb/> Definition 3.3. The elements of the space F <lb/> λ  (A) are called meromorphic <lb/> forms of weight λ (with respect to the theta characteristic L). <lb/> Remark 3.4. In the two extremal cases for the set A we obtain F <lb/> λ  (∅) the <lb/>global holomorphic forms, and F <lb/> λ  (Σ) all meromorphic forms. By compactness <lb/>each f ∈ F <lb/> λ  (Σ) will have only finitely many poles. In the case that f ≡ 0 it will <lb/>also have only finitely many zeros. <lb/>Let us assume that z  i  and z  j  are local coordinates for the same point P ∈ Σ. <lb/>For the bundle K both dz  i  and dz  j  are frames. If we represent the same form f <lb/> locally by f  i  dz  i  and f  j  dz  j  then we conclude from (3.7) that f  j  = f  i  · c  1  and that <lb/>the transition function c  1  is given by <lb/>(3.9) <lb/> c  1  = <lb/> dz  j <lb/> dz  i <lb/>  −1 <lb/> = <lb/> dz  i <lb/> dz  j <lb/> . <lb/> For sections of K <lb/> λ  with λ ∈ Z the transition functions are c  λ  = (c  1  ) <lb/> λ  . The corre-<lb/>sponding is true also for half-integer λ. In this case the basic transition function of <lb/>the chosen theta characteristics L is given as c  1/2  and all others are integer powers <lb/>of it. Symbolically, we write <lb/> √ <lb/> dz  i  or (dz) <lb/> 1/2  for the local frame, keeping in mind <lb/>that the signs for the square root is not uniquely defined but depends on the bundle <lb/> L. <lb/> If f is a meromorphic λ-form it can be represented locally by meromorphic <lb/>functions f  i  . If f ≡ 0 the local representing functions have only finitely many zeros <lb/>and poles. Whether a point P is a zero or a pole of f does not depend on the <lb/>coordinate z  i  chosen, as the transition function c  λ  will be a nonvanishing function. <lb/>Moreover, we can define for P ∈ Σ the order <lb/> (3.10) <lb/>ord  P  (f ) := ord  P  (f  i  ), <lb/>where ord  P  (f  i  ) is the lowest nonvanishing order in the Laurent series expansion of <lb/> f  i  in the variable z  i  around P . It will not depend on the coordinate z  i  chosen. The <lb/>order ord  P  (f ) is (strictly) positive if and only if P is a zero of f . It is negative if <lb/>and only if P is a pole of f . Moreover, its value gives the order of the zero and pole <lb/>respectively. By compactness our Riemann surface Σ can be covered by finitely <lb/></body>

			<body> many coordinate patches. Hence, f can only have finitely many zeros and poles. <lb/>We define the (sectional) degree of f to be <lb/>(3.11) <lb/>sdeg(f ) := <lb/> P ∈Σ <lb/> ord  P  (f ). <lb/> Proposition 3.5. Let f ∈ F <lb/> λ  , f ≡ 0 then <lb/> (3.12) <lb/>sdeg(f ) = 2λ(g − 1). <lb/>For this and related results see [85]. <lb/> 4. Algebraic Structures <lb/> Next we introduce algebraic operations on the vector space of meromorphic <lb/>forms of arbitrary weights. This space is obtained by summing over all weights <lb/>(4.1) <lb/> F := <lb/> λ∈ <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2  Z <lb/> F <lb/> λ  . <lb/> The basic operations will allow us to introduce finally the algebras we are heading <lb/>for. <lb/> 4.1. Associative structure. In this section A is still allowed to be an arbi-<lb/>trary subset of points in Σ. Mostly, we will drop the subset A in the notation. The <lb/>natural map of the locally free sheaves of rang one <lb/>(4.2) <lb/> K <lb/> λ  × K <lb/> ν  → K <lb/> λ  ⊗ K <lb/> ν  ∼ = K <lb/> λ+ν  , (s, t) → s ⊗ t, <lb/> defines a bilinear map <lb/>(4.3) <lb/> · : F <lb/> λ  × F <lb/> ν  → F <lb/> λ+ν  . <lb/> With respect to local trivialisations this corresponds to the multiplication of the <lb/>local representing meromorphic functions <lb/>(4.4) <lb/>(s dz <lb/> λ  , t dz <lb/> ν  ) → s dz <lb/> λ  · t dz <lb/> ν  = s · t dz <lb/> λ+ν  . <lb/> If there is no danger of confusion then we will mostly use the same symbol for the <lb/>section and for the local representing function. <lb/>The following is obvious <lb/> Proposition 4.1. The space F is an associative and commutative graded (over <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  Z) algebra. Moreover, A = F <lb/> 0  is a subalgebra and the F <lb/> λ  are modules over A. <lb/> Of course, A is the algebra of those meromorphic functions on Σ which are holo-<lb/>morphic outside of A. In case that A = ∅, it is the algebra of global holomorphic <lb/>functions. By compactness, these are only the constants, hence A(∅) = C. In case <lb/>that A = Σ it is the field of all meromorphic functions M(Σ). <lb/> 4.2. Lie and Poisson algebra structure. Next we define a Lie algebra <lb/>structure on the space F. The structure is induced by the map <lb/>(4.5) <lb/> F <lb/> λ  × F <lb/> ν  → F <lb/> λ+ν+1  , <lb/> (e, f ) → [e, f ], <lb/>which is defined in local representatives of the sections by <lb/>(4.6) <lb/>(e dz <lb/> λ  , f dz <lb/> ν  ) → [e dz <lb/> λ  , f dz <lb/> ν  ] := <lb/> (−λ)e <lb/> df <lb/>dz <lb/> + νf <lb/>de <lb/>dz <lb/> dz <lb/> λ+ν+1  , <lb/> and bilinearly extended to F. Of course, we have to show the following <lb/></body>

			<body> Proposition 4.2. [91, Prop. 2.6 and 2.7] The prescription [., .] given by (4.6) <lb/>is well-defined and defines a Lie algebra structure on the vector space F. <lb/> Proof. It is a nice exercise to show that the expressions on the right hand <lb/>side in (4.6) transform correctly as local representing functions for λ + ν + 1 forms. <lb/>That the Jacobi identity is true follows from direct calculations, see the above <lb/>reference. <lb/> Proposition 4.3. [91, Prop. 2.8] The subspace L = F <lb/> −1  is a Lie subalgebra, <lb/>and the F <lb/> λ  &apos;s are Lie modules over L. <lb/> Proof. For illustration we supply the proof. For λ = ν = −1 we get as weight <lb/>of the Lie product λ + ν + 1 = −1, hence the subspace is closed under the bracket <lb/>and a Lie subalgebra. For e ∈ L and h ∈ F <lb/> λ  the Lie module structure is given by <lb/> e . h := [e, h] ∈ F <lb/> λ  . The Jacobi identity for e, f ∈ L and h ∈ F <lb/> λ  reads as <lb/>(4.7) <lb/>0 = [[e, f ], h] + [[f, h], e] + [[h, e], f ] = [e, f ] . h − e . (f . h) + f . (e . h). <lb/> This is exactly the condition for F <lb/> λ  being a Lie module. <lb/> Definition 4.4. An algebra (B, ·, [., .]) such that · defines the structure of an <lb/>associative algebra on B and [., .] defines the structure of a Lie algebra on B is called <lb/>a Poisson algebra if and only if the Leibniz rule is true, i.e. <lb/>(4.8) <lb/> ∀e, f, g ∈ B : [e, f · g] = [e, f ] · g + f · [e, g]. <lb/> In other words, via the Lie product [., .] the elements of the algebra act as <lb/>derivations on the associative structure. The reader should be warned that [., .] is <lb/>not necessarily the commutator of the algebra (B, ·). <lb/> Theorem 4.5. [91, Thm. 2.10] The space F with respect to · and [., .] is a <lb/>Poisson algebra. <lb/> Next we consider important substructures. We already encountered the subal-<lb/>gebras A and L. But there are more structures around. <lb/> 4.3. The vector field algebra and the Lie derivative. First we look again <lb/>on the Lie subalgebra L = F <lb/> −1  . Here the Lie action respect the homogeneous <lb/>subspaces F <lb/> λ  . As forms of weight −1 are vector fields, it could also be defined as <lb/>the Lie algebra of those meromorphic vector fields on the Riemann surface Σ which <lb/>are holomorphic outside of A. For vector fields we have the usual Lie bracket and <lb/>the usual Lie derivative for their actions on forms. For the vector fields we have <lb/>(again naming the local functions with the same symbol as the section) for e, f ∈ L <lb/> (4.9) <lb/>[e, f ]  |  = [e(z) <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/>, f (z) <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/> ] = <lb/> e(z) <lb/>df <lb/>dz <lb/> (z) − f (z) <lb/> de <lb/>dz <lb/> (z) <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/>. <lb/> For the Lie derivative we get <lb/>(4.10) <lb/> ∇  e  (f )  |  = L  e  (g)  |  = e . g  |  = <lb/> e(z) <lb/>df <lb/>dz <lb/> (z) + λf (z) <lb/> de <lb/>dz <lb/> (z) <lb/> d <lb/>dz <lb/>. <lb/> Obviously, these definitions coincide with the definitions already given above.

			<body> 4.4. The algebra of differential operators. If we look at F, considered <lb/>as Lie algebra, more closely, we see that F <lb/> 0  is an abelian Lie subalgebra and the <lb/>vector space sum F <lb/> 0  ⊕ F <lb/> −1  = A ⊕ L is also a Lie subalgebra. In an equivalent <lb/>way this can also be constructed as semidirect sum of A considered as abelian Lie <lb/>algebra and L operating on A by taking the derivative. <lb/> Definition 4.6. The Lie algebra of differential operators of degree ≤ 1 is de-<lb/>fined as the semidirect sum of A with L and is denoted by D <lb/> 1  . <lb/>In terms of elements the Lie product is <lb/>(4.11) <lb/>[(g, e), (h, f )] = (e . h − f . g , [e, f ]). <lb/>Using the fact, that A is an abelian subalgebra in F this is exactly the definition <lb/>for the Lie product given for this algebra. Hence, D <lb/> 1  is a Lie algebra. <lb/>The projection on the second factor (g, e) → e is a Lie homomorphism and we <lb/>obtain a short exact sequences of Lie algebras <lb/>(4.12) <lb/>0 − −−− → A − −−− → D <lb/> 1  − −−− → L − −−− → 0 . <lb/> Hence A is an (abelian) Lie ideal of D <lb/> 1  and L a quotient Lie algebra. Obviously L <lb/> is also a subalgebra of D <lb/> 1  . <lb/> Proposition 4.7. The vector space F <lb/> λ  becomes a Lie module over D <lb/> 1  by the <lb/>operation <lb/> (4.13) <lb/>(g, e).f := g · f + e.f, (g, e) ∈ D <lb/> 1  (A), f ∈ F <lb/> λ  (A). <lb/> 4.5. Differential operators of all degree. We want to consider also dif-<lb/>ferential operators of arbitrary degree acting on F <lb/> λ  . This is obtained via some <lb/>universal constructions. First we consider the universal enveloping algebra U (D <lb/> 1  ). <lb/>We denote its multiplication by  and its unit by 1. <lb/> The universal enveloping algebra contains many elements which act in the same <lb/>manner on F <lb/> λ  . For example, if h  1  and h  2  are functions different from constants <lb/>then h  1  · h  2  and h  1  h  2  are different elements of U (D <lb/> 1  ). Nevertheless, they act in <lb/>the same way on F <lb/> λ  . <lb/>Hence we will divide out further relations <lb/>(4.14) <lb/> D = U (D <lb/> 1  )/J, respectively D  λ  = U (D <lb/> 1  )/J  λ <lb/> with the two-sided ideals <lb/> J := ( a  b − a · b, 1 − 1 | a, b ∈ A ), <lb/> J  λ  := ( a  b − a · b, 1 − 1, a  e − a · e + λ e . a | a, b ∈ A, e ∈ L ). <lb/>By universality the F <lb/> λ  are modules over U (D <lb/> 1  ). The relations in J are fulfilled as <lb/>(a  b) · f = a · (b · f ) = (a · b) · f . Hence for all λ the F <lb/> λ  are modules over D. <lb/> If λ is fixed then the additional relations in J  λ  are also true. For this we <lb/>calculate <lb/>(4.15) <lb/>(a  e) . f = a · (e . f ) = ae <lb/>df <lb/>dz <lb/> + λaf <lb/>de <lb/>dz <lb/>, <lb/> (a · e) . f = (ae) <lb/> df <lb/>dz <lb/> + λf <lb/>d(ae) <lb/>dz <lb/> = (ae) <lb/> df <lb/>dz <lb/> + λf e <lb/>da <lb/>dz <lb/> + λf a <lb/>de <lb/>dz <lb/>λ(e . a) · f = λ ef <lb/>da <lb/>dz <lb/></body>

			<body> Hence, <lb/> (4.16) <lb/> a  e − a · e + λ(e . a) <lb/> . f = 0. <lb/>Consequently, for a fixed λ the space F <lb/> λ  is a module over D  λ  . <lb/> Definition 4.8. ([36, IV,16.8,16.11] and [9]) A linear map D : F <lb/> λ  → F <lb/> λ  is <lb/>called an (algebraic) differential operator of degree ≤ n with n ≥ 0 if and only if <lb/>(1) If n = 0 then D = b, the multiplication with a function b ∈ A. <lb/> (2) If n &gt; 0, then for a ∈ A (considered as multiplication operator) <lb/>[D, a] : F <lb/> λ  → F <lb/> λ <lb/> is a differential operator of degree ≤ (n − 1). <lb/>Let Diff <lb/> (n)  (F <lb/> λ  ) be the subspace of all differential operators on F <lb/> λ  of degree ≤ n. <lb/> By composing the operators <lb/>Diff(F <lb/> λ  ) := <lb/> n∈N0 <lb/> Diff <lb/> (n)  (F <lb/> λ  ) <lb/>becomes an associative algebra which is a subalgebra of End(F <lb/> λ  ). <lb/>Let D ∈ D and assume that D is one of the generators <lb/>(4.17) <lb/> D = a  0  e  1  a  1  e  2  · · · a  n−1  e  n  a  n <lb/> with e  i  ∈ L and a  i  ∈ A (written as element in U (D <lb/> 1  )). <lb/> Proposition 4.9. [91, Prop. 2.14] Every element D ∈ D respectively of D  λ  of <lb/>the form (4.17) operates as (algebraic) differential operator of degree ≤ n on F <lb/> λ  . <lb/> In fact, we get (associative) algebra homomorphisms <lb/>(4.18) <lb/> D → Diff(F <lb/> λ  ), <lb/> D  λ  → Diff(F <lb/> λ  ) . <lb/> In case that the set A of points where poles are allowed is finite and non-empty the <lb/>complement Σ \ A is affine [39, p.297]. Hence, as shown in [36] every differential <lb/>operator can be obtained by successively applying first order operators, i.e. by <lb/>applying elements from U (D <lb/> 1  ). In other words the homomorphisms (4.18) are <lb/>surjective. <lb/> 4.6. Lie superalgebras of half forms. Recall from Remark 2.2 the defini-<lb/>tion of a Lie superalgebra. <lb/>With the help of our associative product (4.2) we will obtain examples of Lie <lb/>superalgebras. First we consider <lb/>(4.19) <lb/> · F <lb/> −1/2  × F <lb/> −1/2  → F <lb/> −1  = L , <lb/> and introduce the vector space S with the product <lb/>(4.20) <lb/> S := L ⊕ F <lb/> −1/2  , [(e, ϕ), (f, ψ)] := ([e, f ] + ϕ · ψ, e . ϕ − f . ψ). <lb/> The elements of L are denoted by e, f, . . . , and the elements of F <lb/> −1/2  by ϕ, ψ, . . .. <lb/> The definition (4.20) can be reformulated as an extension of [., .] on L to a <lb/>super-bracket (denoted by the same symbol) on S by setting <lb/>(4.21) <lb/>[e, ϕ] := −[ϕ, e] := e . ϕ = (e <lb/> dϕ <lb/>dz <lb/> − <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> ϕ <lb/>de <lb/>dz <lb/> )(dz) <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> and <lb/>(4.22) <lb/>[ϕ, ψ] := ϕ · ψ . <lb/></body>

			<body> We call the elements of L elements of even parity, and the elements of F <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> elements of odd parity. For such elements x we denote by ¯ <lb/> x ∈ { ¯ 0, ¯ 1} their parity. <lb/>The sum (4.20) can also be described as S = S¯  0  ⊕ S¯  1  , where S¯  i  is the subspace <lb/>of elements of parity ¯ i. <lb/> Proposition 4.10. [91, Prop. 2.15] The space S with the above introduced <lb/>parity and product is a Lie superalgebra. <lb/> Remark 4.11. The choice of the theta characteristics corresponds to choosing <lb/>a spin structure on Σ. For the relation of the Neveu-Schwarz superalgebra to the <lb/>geometry of graded Riemann surfaces see Bryant [17]. <lb/> 4.7. Jordan superalgebra. Leidwanger and Morier-Genoux introduced in <lb/>[61] a Jordan superalgebra in our geometric setting. They put <lb/>(4.23) <lb/> J := F <lb/> 0  ⊕ F <lb/> −1/2  = J¯  0  ⊕ J¯  1  . <lb/> Recall that A = F <lb/> 0  is the associative algebra of meromorphic functions. They <lb/>define the (Jordan) product • via the algebra structures for the spaces F <lb/> λ  by <lb/>(4.24) <lb/> f • g := f · g ∈ F <lb/> 0  , <lb/>f • ϕ := f · ϕ ∈ F <lb/> −1/2  , <lb/>ϕ • ψ := [ϕ, ψ] ∈ F <lb/> 0  . <lb/> By rescaling the second definition with the factor 1/2 one obtains a Lie anti-algebra <lb/> as introduced by Ovsienko [72]. See [61] for more details and additional results on <lb/>representations. <lb/> 4.8. Higher genus current algebras. We fix an arbitrary finite-dimensional <lb/>complex Lie algebra g. Our goal is to generalize the classical current algebra to <lb/>higher genus. For this let (Σ, A) be the geometrical data consisting of the Riemann <lb/>surface Σ and the subset of points A used to define A, the algebra of meromorphic <lb/>functions which are holomorphic outside of the set A ⊆ Σ. <lb/> Definition 4.12. The higher genus current algebra associated to the Lie alge-<lb/>bra g and the geometric data (Σ, A) is the Lie algebra g = g(A) = g(Σ, A) given as <lb/>vector space by g = g ⊗  C  A with the Lie product <lb/>(4.25) <lb/>[x ⊗ f, y ⊗ g] = [x, y] ⊗ f · g, <lb/>x, y ∈ g, f, g ∈ A. <lb/> Proposition 4.13. g is a Lie algebra. <lb/> Proof. The antisymmetry is clear from the definition. Moreover <lb/>[[x ⊗ f, y ⊗ g], z ⊗ h] = [[x, y], z] ⊗ ((f · g) · h). <lb/> As A is associative and commutative summing up cyclically the Jacobi identity <lb/>follows directly from the Jacobi identity for g. <lb/> As usual we will suppress the mentioning of (Σ, A) if not needed. The elements <lb/>of g can be interpreted as meromorphic functions Σ → g from the Riemann surface <lb/>Σ to the Lie algebra g, which are holomorphic outside of A. <lb/> Later we will introduce central extensions for these current algebras. They will <lb/>generalize affine Lie algebras, respectively affine Kac-Moody algebras of untwisted <lb/>type. <lb/></body>

			<body> For some applications it is useful to extend the definition by considering differ-<lb/>ential operators (of degree ≤ 1) associated to g. We define D <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  := g ⊕ L and take <lb/>in the summands the Lie product defined there and put additionally <lb/>(4.26) <lb/>[e, x ⊗ g] := −[x ⊗ g, e] := x ⊗ (e.g). <lb/>This operation can be described as semidirect sum of g with L and we get <lb/> Proposition 4.14. [91, Prop. 2.15] D <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  is a Lie algebra. <lb/> 4.9. Krichever–Novikov type algebras. Above the set A of points where <lb/>poles are allowed was arbitrary. In case that A is finite and moreover #A ≥ 2 the <lb/>constructed algebras are called Krichever–Novikov (KN) type algebras. In this way <lb/>we get the KN vector field algebra, the function algebra, the current algebra, the <lb/>differential operator algebra, the Lie superalgebra, etc. The reader might ask what <lb/>is so special about this situation so that these algebras deserve special names. In <lb/>fact in this case we can endow the algebra with a (strong) almost-graded structure. <lb/>This will be discussed in the next section. The almost-grading is a crucial tool for <lb/>extending the classical result to higher genus. Recall that in the classical case we <lb/>have genus zero and #A = 2. <lb/>Strictly speaking, a KN type algebra should be considered to be one of the above <lb/>algebras for 2 ≤ #A &lt; ∞ together with a fixed chosen almost-grading induced by <lb/>the splitting A = I ∪ O into two disjoint non-empty subset, see Definition 5.1. <lb/> 5. Almost-Graded Structure <lb/>5.1. Definition of almost-gradedness. In the classical situation discussed <lb/>in Section 2 the algebras introduced in the last section are graded algebras. In the <lb/>higher genus case and even in the genus zero case with more than two points where <lb/>poles are allowed there is no non-trivial grading anymore. As realized by Krichever <lb/>and Novikov [56] there is a weaker concept, an almost-grading, which to a large <lb/>extend is a valuable replacement of a honest grading. Such an almost-grading is <lb/>induced by a splitting of the set A into two non-empty and disjoint sets I and O. <lb/> The (almost-)grading is fixed by exhibiting certain basis elements in the spaces F <lb/> λ <lb/> as homogeneous. <lb/> Definition 5.1. Let L be a Lie or an associative algebra such that L = ⊕  n∈Z  L  n <lb/> is a vector space direct sum, then L is called an almost-graded (Lie-) algebra if <lb/>(i) dim L  n  &lt; ∞, <lb/> (ii) There exists constants L  1  , L  2  ∈ Z such that <lb/> L  n  · L  m  ⊆ <lb/> n+m+L2 <lb/> h=n+m−L1 <lb/> L  h  , <lb/> ∀n, m ∈ Z. <lb/> The elements in L  n  are called homogeneous elements of degree n, and L  n  is called <lb/> homogeneous subspace of degree n. <lb/> If dim L  n  is bounded with a bound independent of n we call L strongly almost-<lb/>graded. If we drop the condition that dim L  n  is finite we call L weakly almost-graded. <lb/> In a similar manner almost-graded modules over almost-graded algebras are <lb/>defined. We can extend in an obvious way the definition to superalgebras, respec-<lb/>tively even to more general algebraic structures. This definition makes complete <lb/>sense also for more general index sets J. In fact we will consider the index set <lb/></body>

			<body> J = (1/2)Z in the case of superalgebras. The even elements (with respect to the <lb/>super-grading) will have integer degree, the odd elements half-integer degree. <lb/> 5.2. Separating cycle and Krichever-Novikov pairing. Before we give <lb/>the almost-grading we introduce an important structure. Let C  i  be positively ori-<lb/>ented (deformed) circles around the points P  i  in I, i = 1, . . . , K and C <lb/>  * <lb/> j  positively <lb/>oriented circles around the points Q  j  in O, j = 1, . . . , M . <lb/>A cycle C  S  is called a separating cycle if it is smooth, positively oriented of <lb/>multiplicity one and if it separates the in-points from the out-points. It might have <lb/>multiple components. In the following we will integrate meromorphic differentials <lb/>on Σ without poles in Σ \ A over closed curves C. Hence, we might consider the C <lb/> and C <lb/>  as equivalent if [C] = [C <lb/>  ] in H  1  (Σ \ A, Z). In this sense we can write for <lb/>every separating cycle <lb/>(5.1) <lb/>[C  S  ] = <lb/> K <lb/> i=1 <lb/> [C  i  ] = − <lb/> M <lb/> j=1 <lb/> [C <lb/>  * <lb/> j  ]. <lb/>The minus sign appears due to the opposite orientation. Another way for giving <lb/>such a C  S  is via level lines of a &quot; proper time evolution &quot; , for which I refer to [91, <lb/>Section 3.9]. <lb/>Given such a separating cycle C  S  (respectively cycle class) we define a linear <lb/>map <lb/>(5.2) <lb/> F <lb/> 1  → C, <lb/> ω → <lb/> 1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> ω. <lb/> The map will not depend on the separating line C  S  chosen, as two of such will be <lb/>homologous and the poles of ω are only located in I and O. <lb/> Consequently, the integration of ω over C  S  can also be described over the spe-<lb/>cial cycles C  i  or equivalently over C <lb/>  * <lb/> j  . This integration corresponds to calculating <lb/>residues <lb/>(5.3) <lb/> ω → <lb/> 1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> ω = <lb/> K <lb/> i=1 <lb/> res  Pi  (ω) = − <lb/> M <lb/> l=1 <lb/> res  Q  l  (ω). <lb/> Definition 5.2. The pairing <lb/>(5.4) <lb/> F <lb/> λ  × F <lb/> 1−λ  → C, (f, g) → f, g := <lb/>1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> f · g, <lb/> between λ and 1 − λ forms is called Krichever-Novikov (KN) pairing. <lb/> Note that the pairing depends not only on A (as the F <lb/> λ  depend on it) but also <lb/>critically on the splitting of A into I and O as the integration path will depend on <lb/>it. Once the splitting is fixed the pairing will be fixed too. <lb/>In fact there exit dual basis elements (see (5.9)) hence the pairing is non-<lb/>degenerate. <lb/> 5.3. The homogeneous subspaces. Given the vector spaces F <lb/> λ  of forms <lb/>of weight L we will now single out subspaces F <lb/> λ <lb/>m  of degree m by giving a basis of <lb/>these subspaces. This has been done in the 2-point case by Krichever and Novikov <lb/>[56] and in the multi-point case by the author [77], [78], [79], [80], see also Sadov <lb/>[76]. See in particular [91, Chapters 3,4,5] for a complete treatment. All proofs of <lb/>the statements to come can be found there. <lb/></body>

			<body> Depending on whether the weight λ is integer or half-integer we set J  λ  = Z <lb/> or J  λ  = Z + 1/2. For F <lb/> λ  we introduce for m ∈ J  λ  subspaces F <lb/> λ <lb/>m  of dimension <lb/> K, where K = #I, by exhibiting certain elements f <lb/> λ <lb/>m,p  ∈ F <lb/> λ  , p = 1, . . . , K which <lb/>constitute a basis of F <lb/> λ <lb/>m  . Recall that the spaces F <lb/> λ  for λ ∈ Z + 1/2 depend on the <lb/>chosen square root L (the theta characteristic) of the bundle chosen. The elements <lb/>are the elements of degree m. As explained in the following, the degree is in an <lb/>essential way related to the zero orders of the elements at the points in I. <lb/> Let I = {P  1  , P  2  , . . . , P  K  } then we have for the zero-order at the point P  i  ∈ I <lb/> of the element f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p <lb/> (5.5) <lb/>ord  Pi  (f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p  ) = (n + 1 − λ) − δ <lb/> p <lb/>i  , i = 1, . . . , K . <lb/> The prescription at the points in O is made in such a way that the element f <lb/> λ <lb/>m,p <lb/> is essentially uniquely given. Essentially unique means up to multiplication with <lb/>a constant <lb/> 4 <lb/> . After fixing as additional geometric data a system of coordinates z  l <lb/> centered at P  l  for l = 1, . . . , K and requiring that <lb/>(5.6) <lb/> f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p  (z  p  ) = z <lb/> n−λ <lb/>p <lb/> (1 + O(z  p  ))(dz  p  ) <lb/> λ <lb/> the element f  n,p  is uniquely fixed. In fact, the element f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p  only depends on the <lb/>first jet of the coordinate z  p  . <lb/> Example. Here we will not give the general recipe for the prescription at the <lb/>points in O. Just to give an example which is also an important special case, assume <lb/> O = {Q} is a one-element set.

It is also possible (and for certain applications necessary) to <lb/>write explicitely down the basis elements f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p  in terms of usual objects defined <lb/>on the Riemann surface Σ. For genus zero they can be given with the help of <lb/>rational functions in the quasi-global variable z. For genus one (i.e. the torus case) <lb/>representations with the help of Weierstraß σ and Weierstraß ℘ functions exists. For <lb/>genus ≥ 1 there exists expressions in terms of theta functions (with characteristics) <lb/>and prime forms. Here the Riemann surface has first to be embedded into its <lb/>Jacobian via the Jacobi map. See [91, Chapter 5], [78], [81] for more details. <lb/> 5.4. The algebras. <lb/> Theorem 5.5. [91, Thm. 3.8] There exists constants R  1  and R  2  (depending <lb/>on the number and splitting of the points in A and on the genus g) independent of <lb/> λ and ν and independent of n, m ∈ J such that for the basis elements <lb/> (5.13) <lb/> f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p  · f <lb/> ν <lb/>m,r  = f <lb/> λ+ν <lb/>n+m,r  δ <lb/> r <lb/>p <lb/> + <lb/> n+m+R1 <lb/> h=n+m+1 <lb/>K <lb/> s=1 <lb/> a <lb/> (h,s) <lb/>(n,p)(m,r)  f <lb/> λ+ν <lb/>h,s  , <lb/>a <lb/> (h,s) <lb/>(n,p)(m,r)  ∈ C, <lb/> [f <lb/> λ <lb/>n,p  , f <lb/> ν <lb/>m,r  ] = <lb/>(−λm + νn) f <lb/> λ+ν+1 <lb/>n+m,r  δ <lb/> r <lb/>p <lb/> + <lb/> n+m+R2 <lb/> h=n+m+1 <lb/>K <lb/> s=1 <lb/> b <lb/> (h,s) <lb/>(n,p)(m,r)  f <lb/> λ+ν+1 <lb/>h,s <lb/> , b <lb/> (h,s) <lb/>(n,p)(m,r)  ∈ C. <lb/> This says in particular that with respect to both the associative and Lie struc-<lb/>ture the algebra F is weakly almost-graded.

			<body> In the definition of our KN type algebra only finitely many λ are involved, <lb/>hence the following is immediate <lb/> Theorem 5.6. The Krichever-Novikov type vector field algebras L, function al-<lb/>gebras A, differential operator algebras D <lb/> 1  , Lie superalgebras S, and Jordan super-<lb/>algebras J are all (strongly) almost-graded algebras and the corresponding modules <lb/> F <lb/> λ  are almost-graded modules. <lb/> We obtain with n ∈ J  λ <lb/> (5.15) <lb/>dim L  n  = dim A  n  = dim F <lb/> λ <lb/>n  = K, <lb/> dim S  n  = dim J  n  = 2K, dim D <lb/> 1 <lb/> n  = 3K . <lb/> If U is any of these algebras, with product denoted by [ . ] then <lb/>(5.16) <lb/>[U  n  , U  m  ] ⊆ <lb/> n+m+Ri <lb/> h=n+m <lb/> U  h  , <lb/> with R  i  = R  1  for U = A and R  i  = R  2  otherwise. <lb/>For further reference let us specialize the lowest degree term component in <lb/>(5.13) for certain special cases. <lb/>(5.17) <lb/> A  n,p  · A  m,r  = A  n+m,r  δ <lb/> p <lb/>r  + h.d.t. <lb/> A  n,p  · f <lb/> λ <lb/>m,r  = f <lb/> λ <lb/>n+m,r  δ <lb/> p <lb/>r  + h.d.t. <lb/>[e  n,p  , e  m,r  ] = (m − n) · e  n+m,r  δ <lb/> p <lb/>r  + h.d.t. <lb/> e  n,p  . f <lb/> λ <lb/>m,r  = (m + λn) · f <lb/> λ <lb/>n+m,r  δ <lb/> p <lb/>r  + h.d.t. <lb/>Here h.d.t. denote linear combinations of basis elements of degree between n+m+1 <lb/> and n + m + R  i  , <lb/>Finally, the almost-grading of A induces an almost-grading of the current al-<lb/>gebra g by setting g  n  = g ⊗ A  n  .

Let U be one of the above <lb/>introduced algebras (including the current algebra). On the basis of the almost-<lb/>grading we obtain a triangular decomposition of the algebras <lb/>(5.19) <lb/> U = U  [+]  ⊕ U  [0]  ⊕ U  [−]  , <lb/> where <lb/>(5.20) <lb/> U  [+]  := <lb/> m&gt;0 <lb/> U  m  , U  [0]  = <lb/> m=0 <lb/> m=−Ri <lb/> U  m  , U  [−]  := <lb/> m&lt;−Ri <lb/> U  m  . <lb/> By the almost-gradedness the [+] and [−] subspaces are (infinite dimensional) sub-<lb/>algebras.

			<body> Proposition 5.7. [91, Prop. 3.15] <lb/>(5.22) <lb/> F <lb/> λ <lb/> (n)  = { f ∈ F <lb/> λ  | ord  Pi  (f ) ≥ n − λ, ∀i = 1, . . . , K }. <lb/> This proposition is very important. In case that O has more than one point <lb/>there are certain choices, e.g. numbering of the points in O, different rules, etc. <lb/>involved in defining the almost-grading. Hence, if the choices are made differently <lb/>the subspaces F <lb/> λ <lb/>n  might depend on them, and consequently also the almost-grading. <lb/>But by this proposition the induced filtration is indeed canonically defined via the <lb/>splitting of A into I and O. <lb/> Moreover, different choices will give equivalent almost-grading. We stress the <lb/>fact, that under a KN algebra we will always understand one of introduced algebras <lb/>together with an almost-grading (respectively equivalence class of almost-grading, <lb/>respectively filtration) introduced by the splitting A = I ∪ O. <lb/> 6. Central Extensions <lb/> Central extension of our algebras appear naturally in the context of quantiza-<lb/>tion and regularization of actions. Of course they are also of independent mathe-<lb/>matical interest. <lb/> 6.1. Central extensions and cocycles. For the convenience of the reader <lb/>let us repeat the relation between central extensions and the second Lie algebra <lb/>cohomology with values in the trivial module. A central extension of a Lie algebra <lb/> W is a special Lie algebra structure on the vector space direct sum <lb/> W = C ⊕ W . <lb/>If we denotê <lb/> x := (0, x) and t := (1, 0) then the Lie structure is given by <lb/>(6.1) <lb/>[ˆ x, ˆ <lb/> y] = <lb/> [x, y] + ψ(x, y) · t, [t, <lb/> W ] = 0, x, y ∈ W , <lb/> with bilinear form ψ. The map x → ˆ <lb/> x = (0, x) is a linear splitting map. <lb/> W will be a <lb/>Lie algebra, e.g. will fulfill the Jacobi identity, if and only if ψ is an antisymmetric <lb/>bilinear form and fulfills the Lie algebra 2-cocycle condition <lb/>(6.2) <lb/>0 = d  2  ψ(x, y, z) := ψ([x, y], z) + ψ([y, z], x) + ψ([z, x], y). <lb/> Two central extensions are equivalent if they essentially correspond only to the <lb/>choice of different splitting maps. A 2-cochain ψ is a coboundary if there exists a <lb/>linear form ϕ : W → C such that <lb/>(6.3) <lb/> ψ(x, y) = ϕ([x, y]). <lb/> Every coboundary is a cocycle. The second Lie algebra cohomology H <lb/> 2  (W, C) of <lb/> W with values in the trivial module C is defined as the quotient of the space of <lb/>cocycles modulo coboundaries. Moreover, two central extensions are equivalent if <lb/>and only if the difference of their defining 2-cocycles ψ and ψ <lb/>  is a coboundary. In <lb/>this way the second Lie algebra cohomology H <lb/> 2  (W, C) classifies equivalence classes <lb/>of central extensions. The class [0] corresponds to the trivial central extension. In <lb/>this case the splitting map is a Lie homomorphism. To construct central extensions <lb/>of our algebras we have to find such Lie algebra 2-cocycles. <lb/>Clearly, equivalent central extensions are isomorphic. The opposite is not true. <lb/>In our case we can always rescale the central element by multiplying it with a <lb/>nonzero scalar. This is an isomorphism but not an equivalence of central extensions. <lb/>Nevertheless it is an irrelevant modification. Hence we will be mainly interested in <lb/></body>

			<body> central extensions modulo equivalence and rescaling. They are classified by [0] and <lb/>the elements of the projectivized cohomology space P(H <lb/> 2  (W, C)). <lb/> In the classical case we have dim H <lb/> 2  (W, C) = 1, hence there are only two <lb/>essentially different central extensions, the splitting one given by the direct sum <lb/> C ⊕ W of Lie algebras and the up to equivalence and rescaling unique non-trivial <lb/>one, the Virasoro algebra V. <lb/> 6.2. Geometric cocycles. The defining cocycle <lb/>(6.4) <lb/>1 <lb/>12 <lb/>(n <lb/> 3  − n)δ <lb/> −m <lb/> n <lb/> for the Virasoro algebra is very special. Obviously it does not make any sense in <lb/>the higher genus and/or multi-point case. We need to find a geometric description. <lb/>For this we have first to introduce connections. <lb/>6.2.1. Projective and affine connections. Let (U  α  , z  α  )  α∈J  be a covering of <lb/>the Riemann surface by holomorphic coordinates with transition functions z  β  = <lb/> f  βα  (z  α  ). <lb/> Definition 6.1. (a) A system of local (holomorphic, meromorphic) functions <lb/> R = (R  α  (z  α  )) is called a (holomorphic, meromorphic) projective connection if it <lb/>transforms as <lb/>(6.5) R  β  (z  β  ) · (f <lb/> β,α  ) <lb/> 2  = R  α  (z  α  ) + S(f  β,α  ), <lb/>with S(h) = <lb/> h <lb/> h   − <lb/> 3 <lb/>2 <lb/> h <lb/> h  <lb/>  2 <lb/> , <lb/> the Schwartzian derivative. Here <lb/>  denotes differentiation with respect to the coor-<lb/>dinate z  α  . <lb/>(b) A system of local (holomorphic, meromorphic) functions T = (T  α  (z  α  )) is <lb/>called a (holomorphic, meromorphic) affine connection if it transforms as <lb/>(6.6) <lb/> T  β  (z  β  ) · (f <lb/> β,α  ) = T  α  (z  α  ) + <lb/> f <lb/> β,α <lb/> f  <lb/> β,α <lb/> . <lb/> Every Riemann surface admits a holomorphic projective connection [40],[38]. <lb/>Given a point P then there exists always a meromorphic affine connection holo-<lb/>morphic outside of P and having maximally a pole of order one there [80]. <lb/>From their very definition it follows that the difference of two affine (projec-<lb/>tive) connections will be a (quadratic) differential. Hence, after fixing one affine <lb/>(projective) connection all others are obtained by adding (quadratic) differentials. <lb/>6.2.2. The function algebra A. We consider it as abelian Lie algebra. Let C be <lb/>an arbitrary smooth but not necessarily connected curve. We set <lb/>(6.7) <lb/> ψ <lb/> 1 <lb/> C  (g, h) := <lb/>1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C <lb/> gdh, g, h ∈ A. <lb/> 6.2.3. The current algebra g. For g = g ⊗ A we fix a symmetric, invariant, <lb/>bilinear form β on g (not necessarily non-degenerate). Recall, that invariance means <lb/>that we have β([x, y], z) = β(x, [y, z]) for all x, y, z ∈ g. Then a cocycle is given as <lb/>(6.8) <lb/> ψ <lb/> 2 <lb/> C,β  (x ⊗ g, y ⊗ h) := β(x, y) · <lb/> 1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C <lb/> gdh, x, y ∈ g, g, h ∈ A. <lb/></body>

			<body> 6.2.4. The vector field algebra L. Here it is a little bit more delicate. First we <lb/>have to choose a (holomorphic) projective connection R. We define <lb/>(6.9) <lb/> ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C,R  (e, f ) := <lb/>1 <lb/>24πi <lb/> C <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(e <lb/>  f − ef <lb/>  ) − R · (e <lb/>  f − ef <lb/>  ) <lb/> dz . <lb/> Only by the term coming with the projective connection it will be a well-defined <lb/>differential, i.e. independent of the coordinate chosen. It is shown in [80] (and <lb/>[91]) that it is a cocycle. Another choice of a projective connection will result in <lb/>a cohomologous one. Hence, the equivalence class of the central extension will be <lb/>the same. <lb/>6.2.5. The differential operator algebra D <lb/> 1  . For the differential operator algebra <lb/>the cocycles of type (6.7) for A can be extended by zero on the subspace L. The <lb/>cocycles for L can be pulled back. In addition there is a third type of cocycles <lb/>mixing A and L: <lb/> (6.10) <lb/> ψ <lb/> 4 <lb/> C,T  (e, g) := <lb/>1 <lb/>24πi <lb/> C <lb/> (eg <lb/>  + T eg <lb/>  )dz, <lb/> e ∈ L, g ∈ A, <lb/> with an affine connection T , with at most a pole of order one at a fixed point in O. <lb/> Again, a different choice of the connection will not change the cohomology class. <lb/>For more details on the cocycles see [83], [91]. <lb/>6.2.6. The Lie superalgebra S. Here we have to take into account that it is not <lb/>a Lie algebra. Hence, the Jacobi identity has to be replaced by the super-Jacobi <lb/>identity. The conditions for being a cocycle for the superalgebra cohomology will <lb/>change too. Recall the definition of the algebra from Section 4.6, in particular that <lb/>the even elements (parity 0) are the vector fields and the odd elements (parity 1) are <lb/>the half-forms. A bilinear form c is a cocycle if the following is true. The bilinear <lb/>map c will be symmetric if both x and y are odd, otherwise it will be antisymmetric: <lb/>(6.11) <lb/> c(x, y) = −(−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> x¯ y  c(x, y). <lb/> The super-cocycle condition reads as <lb/>(6.12) <lb/>(−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> x¯ z  c(x, [y, z]) + (−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> y ¯ <lb/> x  c(y, [z, x]) + (−1) <lb/> ¯ <lb/> z ¯ <lb/> y  c(z, [x, y]) = 0. <lb/>With the help of c we can define central extensions in the Lie superalgebra sense. <lb/>If we put the condition that the central element is even then the cocycle c has to <lb/>be an even map and c vanishes for pairs of elements of different parity. <lb/>By convention we denote vector fields by e, f, g, ... and -1/2-forms by ϕ, ψ, χ, .. <lb/> and get <lb/>(6.13) <lb/> c(e, ϕ) = 0, e ∈ L, ϕ ∈ F <lb/> −1/2  . <lb/> The super-cocycle conditions for the even elements is just the cocycle condition for <lb/>the Lie subalgebra L. The only other nonvanishing super-cocycle condition is for <lb/>the (even,odd,odd) elements and reads as <lb/>(6.14) <lb/> c(e, [ϕ, ψ]) − c(ϕ, e . ψ) − c(ψ, e . ϕ) = 0. <lb/>Here the definition of the product [e, ψ] := e . ψ was used. <lb/>If we have a cocycle c for the algebra S we obtain by restriction a cocycle for <lb/>the algebra L. For the mixing term we know that c(e, ψ) = 0. A naive try to <lb/>put just anything for c(ϕ, ψ) (for example 0) will not work as (6.14) relates the <lb/>restriction of the cocycle on L with its values on F <lb/> −1/2  . <lb/></body>

			<body> Proposition 6.2. [88] Let C be any closed (differentiable) curve on Σ not <lb/>meeting the points in A, and let R be any (holomorphic) projective connection then <lb/>the bilinear extension of <lb/> (6.15) <lb/>Φ  C,R  (e, f ) := <lb/>1 <lb/>24πi <lb/> C <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(e <lb/>  f − ef <lb/>  ) − R · (e <lb/>  f − ef <lb/>  ) <lb/> dz <lb/> Φ  C,R  (ϕ, ψ) := − <lb/> 1 <lb/>24πi <lb/> C <lb/> (ϕ <lb/>  · ψ + ϕ · ψ <lb/>  − R · ϕ · ψ) dz <lb/> Φ  C,R  (e, ϕ) := 0 <lb/> gives a Lie superalgebra cocycle for S, hence defines a central extension of S. A <lb/>different projective connection will yield a cohomologous cocycle. <lb/> A similar formula was given by Bryant in [17]. By adding the projective con-<lb/>nection in the second part of (6.15) he corrected some formula appearing in [12]. <lb/>He only considered the two-point case and only the integration over a separating <lb/>cycle. See also [54] for the multi-point case, where still only the integration over a <lb/>separating cycle is considered. <lb/>In contrast to the differential operator algebra case the two parts cannot be <lb/>prescribed independently. Only with the same integration path (more precisely, <lb/>homology class) and the given factors in front of the integral it will work. The <lb/>reason for this is that (6.14) relates both. <lb/> 6.3. Uniqueness and classification of central extensions. The above in-<lb/>troduced cocycles depend on the choice of the connections R and T . Different <lb/>choices will not change the cohomology class. Hence, this ambiguity does not <lb/>disturb us. What really matters is that they depend on the integration curve C <lb/> chosen. <lb/>In contrast to the classical situation, for the higher genus and/or multi-point <lb/>situation there are many essentially different closed curves and hence many non-<lb/>equivalent central extensions defined by the integration. <lb/>But we should take into account that we want to extend the almost-grading <lb/>from our algebras to the centrally extended ones. This means we take deg <lb/>  := deg x <lb/> and assign a degree deg(t) to the central element t, and still we want to obtain <lb/>almost-gradedness. <lb/>This is possible if and only if our defining cocycle ψ is &quot; local &quot; in the following <lb/>sense (the name was introduced in the two point case by Krichever and Novikov in <lb/>[56]). There exists M  1  , M  2  ∈ Z such that <lb/>(6.16) <lb/> ∀n, m : ψ(W  n  , W  m  )  = 0 =⇒ M  1  ≤ n + m ≤ M  2  . <lb/> Here W stands for any of our algebras (including the supercase). Very important, <lb/> &quot; local &quot; is defined in terms of the almost-grading, and the almost-grading itself <lb/>depends on the splitting A = I ∪ O. Hence what is &quot; local &quot; depends on the splitting <lb/>too. <lb/>We will call a cocycle bounded (from above) if there exists M ∈ Z such that <lb/>(6.17) <lb/> ∀n, m : ψ(W  n  , W  m  )  = 0 =⇒ n + m ≤ M. <lb/> Similarly bounded from below can be defined. Locality means bounded from above <lb/>and from below. <lb/>Given a cocycle class we call it bounded (respectively local) if and only if <lb/>it contains a representing cocycle which is bounded (respectively local).

			<body> cocycles in a bounded class have to be bounded. If we choose as integration path <lb/>a separating cocycle C  S  , or one of the C  i  then the above introduced geometric <lb/>cocycles are local, respectively bounded. Recall that in this case integration can <lb/>be done by calculating residues at the in-points or at the out-points. All these <lb/>cocycles are cohomologically nontrivial. The theorems in the following concern the <lb/>opposite direction. They were treated in my works [83], [84], [88]. See also [91] <lb/>for a complete and common treatment. <lb/>The following result for the vector field algebra L gives the principal structure <lb/>of the classification results. <lb/> Theorem 6.3. [83], [91, Thm. 6.41] Let L be the Krichever–Novikov vector <lb/>field algebra with a given almost-grading induced by the splitting A = I ∪ O. <lb/> (a) The space of bounded cohomology classes is K-dimensional (K = #I). A <lb/>basis is given by setting the integration path in (6.9) to C  i  , i = 1, . . . , K the little <lb/>(deformed) circles around the points P  i  ∈ I. <lb/> (b) The space of local cohomology classes is one-dimensional. A generator is given <lb/>by integrating (6.9) over a separating cocycle C  S  , i.e. <lb/> (6.18) <lb/> ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C  S  ,R  (e, f ) = <lb/>1 <lb/>24πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(e <lb/>  f − ef <lb/>  ) − R · (e <lb/>  f − ef <lb/>  ) <lb/> dz . <lb/> (c) Up to equivalence and rescaling there is only one non-trivial one-dimensional <lb/>central extension <lb/> L of the vector field algebra L which allows an extension of the <lb/>almost-grading. <lb/> Remark 6.4. In the classical situation, Part (c) shows also that the Virasoro <lb/>algebra is the unique non-trivial central extension of the Witt algebra (up to equiv-<lb/>alence and rescaling). This result extends to the more general situation under the <lb/>condition that one fixes the almost-grading, hence the splitting A = I ∪ O. Here I <lb/>like to repeat the fact that for L depending on the set A and its possible splittings <lb/>into two disjoint subsets there are different almost-gradings. Hence, the &quot; unique &quot; <lb/>central extension finally obtained will also depend on the splitting. Only in the two <lb/>point case there is only one splitting possible. In the case that the genus g ≥ 1 <lb/>there are even integration paths possible in the definition of (6.9) which are not <lb/>homologous to a separating cycle of any splitting. Hence, there are other central <lb/>extensions possible not corresponding to any almost-grading. <lb/>The above theorem is a model for all other classification results. We will always <lb/>obtain a statement about the bounded (from above) cocycles and then for the local <lb/>cocycles. <lb/>If we consider the function algebra A as an abelian Lie algebra then every <lb/>skew-symmetric bilinear form will be a non-trivial cocycle. Hence, there is no hope <lb/>of uniqueness. But if we add the condition of L-invariance, which is given as <lb/>(6.19) <lb/> ψ(e.g, h) + ψ(g, e.h) = 0, ∀e ∈ L, g, h ∈ A <lb/> things will change. <lb/>Let us denote the the subspace of local cohomology classes by H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  , and the <lb/>subspace of local and L-invariant cohomology classes by H <lb/> 2 <lb/> L,loc  . Note that the <lb/>condition is only required for at least one representative in the cohomology class. <lb/>We collect a part of the results for the cocycle classes of the other algebras in the <lb/>following theorem. <lb/></body>

			<body> Theorem 6.5. [91, Cor. 6.48] <lb/> (a) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> L,loc  (A, C) = 1, <lb/> (b) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  (L, C) = 1, <lb/> (c) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  (D <lb/> 1  , C) = 3, <lb/> (d) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  (g, C) = 1 for g a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra, <lb/>(e) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  (S, C) = 1, <lb/> A basis of the cohomology spaces are given by taking the cohomology classes of the <lb/>cocycles (6.7), (6.9), (6.10), (6.8), (6.15) obtained by integration over a separating <lb/>cycle C  S  . <lb/> Consequently, we obtain also for these algebras the corresponding result about <lb/>uniqueness of almost-graded central extensions. For the differential operator algebra <lb/>we get three independent cocycles. This generalizes results of [2] for the classical <lb/>case. <lb/>For result on the bounded cocycle classes we have to multiply the dimensions <lb/>above by K. For the supercase with odd central element the bounded cohomology <lb/>vanishes. <lb/>For g a reductive Lie algebra and the cocycle L-invariant if restricted to the <lb/>abelian part, a complete classification of local cocycle classes for both g and D <lb/> 1 <lb/> g  can <lb/>be found in [84], [91, Chapter 9]. See also the examples below. Note that in the <lb/>case of a simple Lie algebra every symmetric, invariant bilinear form β is a multiple <lb/>of the Cartan-Killing form. <lb/>I like to mention that in all the applications I know of, the cocycles coming <lb/>from representations, regularizations, etc. are local. Hence, the uniqueness or <lb/>classification result above can be used. <lb/> 7. Examples and Generalizations <lb/>7.1. Examples: sl(n) and gl(n). For illustration we give the cocycles for <lb/>the important special cases sl(n) (which is a simple algebra) and the case of gl(n) <lb/> (which is reductive but not semisimple). We will study the current and the affine <lb/>algebras, the differential operator algebras, and their central extensions. <lb/>7.1.1. sl(n). This is the Lie algebra of trace-less complex n × n matrices. Up to <lb/>multiplication with a scalar the Cartan-Killing form β(x, y) = tr(xy) is the unique <lb/>symmetric invariant bilinear form. It is non-degenerate. <lb/> Proposition 7.1. [91, Prop. 9.47] (a) Every local cocycle for the current al-<lb/>gebra sl(n) is cohomologous to <lb/> (7.1) <lb/> γ(x(g), y(h)) = r <lb/> tr(xy) <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> gdh, r ∈ C. <lb/> (b) Every L-invariant local cocycle equals the cocycle (7.1) with a suitable r. <lb/> (c) Every local cocycle for the differential operator algebra D <lb/> 1 <lb/> sl(n)  is cohomologous <lb/>to a linear combination of (7.1) and the standard local cocycle (6.18) for the vector <lb/>field algebra. In particular, no cocycles of pure mixing type exists. <lb/></body>

			<body> 7.1.2. gl(n). This is the Lie algebra of all complex n × n-matrices. Recall that <lb/> gl(n) can be written as Lie algebra direct sum <lb/>(7.2) <lb/> gl(n) = s(n) ⊕ sl(n) ∼ = C ⊕ sl(n). <lb/> Here s(n) denotes the n × n scalar matrices. This decomposition is the decompo-<lb/>sition as reductive Lie algebra into its abelian and semisimple summands. <lb/>After tensoring with A we obtain <lb/>(7.3) <lb/> gl(n) = s(n) ⊕ sl(n) ∼ = A ⊕ sl(n). <lb/> Proposition 7.2. [91, Prop. 9.48] (a) A cocycle γ for gl(n) is local and re-<lb/>stricted to s(n) is L-invariant if and only if it is cohomologous to a linear combi-<lb/>nation γ <lb/>  of the following two cocycles <lb/> (7.4) <lb/> γ  1  (x(g), y(h)) = <lb/>tr(xy) <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> gdh, <lb/>γ  2  (x(g), y(h)) = <lb/>tr(x)tr(y) <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> gdh. <lb/> (b) If the cocycle γ of (a) is L-invariant then γ is equal to a linear combination <lb/> r  1  γ  1  + r  2  γ  2  of the cocycles (7.4) <lb/>(c) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  (gl(n), C) = 2. <lb/> Proposition 7.3. [91, Prop. 9.49] (a) Every local cocycle γ for D <lb/> 1 <lb/> gl(n)  is coho-<lb/>mologous to a linear combination of the cocycles γ  1  and γ  2  of (7.4), of the mixing <lb/>cocycle <lb/> (7.5) <lb/> γ <lb/> (m) <lb/> S,tr,T  (e, x(g)) = <lb/>tr(x) <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> ˜ <lb/> eg <lb/>  + T ˜ <lb/> eg <lb/> dz, <lb/> and of the standard local cocycle ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C  S  ,R  for the vector field algebra, i.e. <lb/> (7.6) <lb/> γ = r  1  γ  1  + r  2  γ  2  + r  3  γ <lb/> (m) <lb/> S,tr,T  + r  4  ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C  S  ,R  + coboundary, <lb/>with suitable r  1  , r  2  , r  3  , r  4  ∈ C. <lb/> (b) If the cocycle γ is local and restricted to gl(n) is L-invariant, and r  3  , r  4  = 0 <lb/> then there exist an affine connection T <lb/>  and a projective connection R <lb/>  holomorphic <lb/>outside A such that γ = r  1  γ  1  + r  2  γ  2  + r  3  γ  S,tr,T   + r  4  γ <lb/> L <lb/> S,R   . <lb/>(c) dim H <lb/> 2 <lb/> loc  (D <lb/> 1 <lb/> gl(n)  , C) = 4. <lb/> 7.2. The genus zero and three-point situation. For illustration let us <lb/>consider the the three-point KN type algebras of genus zero. We consider the <lb/>Riemann sphere S <lb/> 2  = P <lb/> 1  and a set A consisting of 3 points. Given any triple of 3 <lb/>points there exists always an analytic automorphism of P <lb/> 1  mapping this triple to <lb/> {a, −a, ∞}, with a  = 0. In fact a = 1 would suffice. Without restriction we can <lb/>take <lb/> I := {∞}, O := {a, −a} . <lb/> Due to the symmetry of the situation it is more convenient to take a symmetrized <lb/>basis of A (with k ∈ Z) <lb/> (7.7) <lb/> A  2k  := (z − a) <lb/> k  (z + a) <lb/> k  , <lb/>A  2k+1  := z(z − a) <lb/> k  (z + a) <lb/> k  , <lb/> for L (with k ∈ Z) <lb/> (7.8) <lb/> V  2k  := z(z − a) <lb/> k  (z + a) <lb/> k  d <lb/>dz <lb/>, <lb/>V  2k+1  := (z − a) <lb/> k+1  (z + a) <lb/> k+1  d <lb/>dz <lb/>, <lb/></body>

By straight-forward calculations we obtain for the <lb/>algebras the following structures. <lb/> The function algebra. <lb/> (7.10) <lb/> A  n  · A  m  = <lb/> A  n+m  , <lb/>n or m even, <lb/> A  n+m  + a <lb/> 2  ⊗ A  n+m−2  , n and m odd. <lb/> The vector field algebra. <lb/> (7.11) [V  n  , V  m  ] = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> (m − n)V  n+m  , <lb/>n, m odd, <lb/>(m − n) <lb/> V  n+m  + a <lb/> 2  V  n+m−2  ), <lb/> n, m even, <lb/>(m − n)V  n+m  + (m − n − 1)a <lb/> 2  V  n+m−2  , n odd, m even. <lb/> The current algebra. <lb/> (7.12) [x ⊗ A  n  , y ⊗ A  m  ] = <lb/> [x, y] ⊗ A  n+m  , <lb/>n or m even, <lb/>[x, y] ⊗ A  n+m  + a <lb/> 2  [x, y] ⊗ A  n+m−2  , n and m odd. <lb/>The structure equations for the superalgebra look similar and can be easily <lb/>calculated. <lb/>The central extensions can be given by determining the cocycle values by cal-<lb/>culating the residues of the integrand at ∞. For example the local cocycle ψ <lb/> 1 <lb/> C  S <lb/> for <lb/>the function algebra calculates as (see [30, A.13 and A.14]) <lb/>(7.13) <lb/>1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> A  n  dA  m  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> −nδ <lb/> −n <lb/> m  , <lb/>n, m even, <lb/>0, <lb/> n, m different parity, <lb/> −nδ <lb/> −n <lb/> m  + a <lb/> 2  (−n + 1)δ <lb/> −n+2 <lb/> m <lb/> , n, m odd. <lb/>The affine algebra is now given as the almost-graded central extension  g  β,S  of the <lb/>current algebra given by the cocycle <lb/>(7.14) <lb/> ψ <lb/> 2 <lb/> C  S  ,β  (x ⊗ A  n  , y ⊗ A  m  ) = β(x, y) · <lb/> 1 <lb/>2πi <lb/> C  S <lb/> A  n  dA  m  = β · ψ <lb/> 1 <lb/> C  S  . <lb/> Three-point sl(2, C)-current algebra for genus 0. <lb/> Given a simple Lie algebra g with generators and structure equations the relations <lb/>above can be written in these terms. An important example is sl(2, C) with the <lb/>standard generators <lb/> h := <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>0 −1 <lb/> , e := <lb/> 0 1 <lb/>0 0 <lb/> , f := <lb/> 0 0 <lb/>1 0 <lb/> . </body>

			<body> We set e  n  := e ⊗ A  n  , n ∈ Z and in the same way f  n  and h  n  . Recall that the <lb/>invariant bilinear form β(x, y) = tr(x · y). We calculate <lb/>[e  n  , f  m  ] = <lb/> h  n+m  , <lb/>n or m even, <lb/> h  n+m  + a <lb/> 2  h  n+m−2  , n and m odd, <lb/>(7.15) <lb/>[h  n  , e  m  ] = <lb/> 2e  n+m  , <lb/>n or m even, <lb/>2e  n+m  + 2a <lb/> 2  e  n+m−2  , n and m odd, <lb/>(7.16) <lb/>[h  n  , f  m  ] = <lb/> −2f  n+m  , <lb/>n or m even, <lb/> −2f  n+m  − 2a <lb/> 2  f  n+m−2  , n and m odd. <lb/>(7.17) <lb/>For the central extension we obtain <lb/>(7.18) [e  n  , f  m  ] = <lb/> h  n+m  − nδ <lb/> −n <lb/> m  , <lb/>n or m even, <lb/> h  n+m  + a <lb/> 2  h  n+m−2  − nδ <lb/> −n <lb/> m  − a <lb/> 2  (n − 1)δ <lb/> −n+2 <lb/> m <lb/> , n and m odd. <lb/>For the other commutators we do not have contributions to the center. <lb/> 7.3. Deformations. As the second Lie algebra cohomology of the Witt and <lb/>Virasoro algebra in their adjoint module vanishes [87], [27], [28] both are formally <lb/>and infinitesimally rigid. This means that all formal (and infinitesimal) families <lb/>with special fiber these algebras are equivalent to the trivial one. If we consider <lb/>the examples of Section 7.2 parameterized by a variable a, then they are non-<lb/>trivial (even locally non-trivial) families which have themselves as special elements <lb/>for a = 0 the classical algebras. The geometric context is clear: the two points <lb/> a and −a move together. By Fialowski and Schlichenmaier [29], [30], [31] the <lb/>above algebras and similar families of algebras on tori, were used to exhibit the <lb/>fact, that e.g. the Witt and Virasoro algebra despite their formal rigidity allow <lb/>non-trivial algebraic-geometric deformations. This is an effect that cannot appear <lb/>in the finite-dimensional algebra setting. For families on tori see the above quoted <lb/>results, respectively [91, Chapter 12]. See also [78], [13], [15], [19] [24], [74]. <lb/> 7.4. Genus zero multi-point algebras – integrable systems. Already <lb/>the Witt and Virasoro algebra in genus zero with two points where poles are al-<lb/>lowed are mathematically highly interesting objects which have e.g. a non-trivial <lb/>representation theory. If we remain on the Riemann sphere but now allow more than <lb/>two poles we obtain an even more demanding mathematical theory. For the multi-<lb/>point case the related systems are important. For example the classical Knizhnik-<lb/>Zamolodchikov models of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) are of this type, see e.g. <lb/>[53]. Integrable systems show up. <lb/>Due to the connection between CFT and statistical mechanics it is not a surprise <lb/>that the genus zero multi-point Krichever–Novikov algebras turn out to be related <lb/>to algebras appearing in statistical mechanics. For example the Onsager algebra <lb/> appears as subalgebra of the three-point, g = 0, sl(2, C)-Krichever–Novikov algebra. <lb/>In this context see e.g. the work of Terwilliger and collaborators [41], [5], [46]. <lb/>For the genus zero multi-point situation quite a number of publications ap-<lb/>peared. Some references are [78], [29], [30], [31], [14], [16], [86], [1], [21]. <lb/>From the point of view of symmetries of integrable systems the concept of auto-<lb/>morphic Lie algebras shows up. It was e.g. developed by Lombardo, Mikailov, and <lb/>Sanders in [64], [65], [66]. Invariant objects under finite subgroups of P GL(2, C), <lb/></body>

			<body> the symmetry group of the Riemann sphere, are studied. Of course, there are re-<lb/>lations to the g = 0, multi-point Krichever–Novikov type algebras. Chopp [20] <lb/>obtained some results for the genus one multi-point setting. <lb/> 7.5. Toroidal Lie algebras. The path of generalization starting from the <lb/>classical picture as taken by Krichever–Novikov goes from genus zero to higher <lb/>genus. There is another path by considering instead of the classical algebra of <lb/>Laurent polynomial C[z <lb/> −1  , z] as starting point, the algebra generated by several <lb/> &quot; Laurent variables &quot; . This generalization is in the context of current algebras quite <lb/>natural, as there the finite-dimensional Lie algebra can be tensorized by an arbitrary <lb/>commutative algebra. The algebras obtained in this way are called toroidal algebras. <lb/> They correspond to increasing the dimension instead of the genus. A short collection <lb/>of references and names is given by Bermann, Billig, Buelk, Cox, Futorny, Hu, <lb/>Jurisich, Kashuba, Penkov, Szmigielski, Xia, Yokunuma, [8], [18], [35], [6], [7], <lb/>[22], [10], [25], [69], [70], [107]. <lb/> 7.6. Other generalizations of KN type algebras. We considered geomet-<lb/>ric vector fields, respectively differential operators. Donin and Khesin [26] showed <lb/>that also pseudo-differential symbols could be treated via some Krichever–Novikov <lb/>like objects. <lb/>Furthermore there are discretized and q-deformed Krichever–Novikov type alge-<lb/>bras. In the definition of the KN vector field algebra the differential can be replaced <lb/>by a difference operator assuming that we have a geometric situation appropriate <lb/>to this discretization. See e.g. Meiler and Ruffing [73], [67]. <lb/>Such discretizations are related to q-deformed versions of the Krichever–Novikov <lb/>vector field algebra -again for special geometric cases. In some sense the struc-<lb/>ture equations are deformed by expressions depending on a formal parameter q. <lb/> One does not obtain Lie algebras anymore, but q-Lie algebras. The q-Witt and <lb/> q-Virasoro algebras are of certain importance in the context of integrable systems. <lb/>One might guess that the same will be the case for the q-deformed Krichever– <lb/>Novikov vector field algebra. See e.g. the references Kuang [60], Oh and Singh <lb/>[71]. <lb/> 8. Lax Operator Algebras <lb/> Recently, a new class of current type algebras appeared, the Lax operator <lb/>algebras. As the naming indicates, they are related to integrable systems [101]. <lb/>The algebras were introduced by Krichever [55], and Krichever and Sheinman [59]. <lb/>Here I will report on their definition. See the book [102] of Sheinman for more <lb/>details. <lb/>Compared to the KN current type algebra we will allow additional singularities <lb/>which will play a special role. The points where these singularities are allowed are <lb/>called weak singular points. The set of such points is denoted by <lb/>(8.1) <lb/> W = {γ  s  ∈ Σ \ A | s = 1, . . . , R}. <lb/> Here let g be one of the classical matrix algebras gl(n), sl(n), so(n), sp(2n). We <lb/>assign to every point γ  s  a vector α  s  ∈ C <lb/> n  (respectively ∈ C <lb/> 2n  for sp(2n)). The <lb/>system <lb/>(8.2) <lb/> T := {(γ  s  , α  s  ) ∈ Σ × C <lb/> n  | s = 1, . . . , R} <lb/></body>

			<body> is called Tyurin data. <lb/> Remark 8.1. In case that R = n · g and for generic values of (γ  s  , α  s  ) with <lb/> α  s  = 0 the tuples of pairs (γ  s  , [α  s  ]) with [α  s  ] ∈ P <lb/> n−1  (C) parameterize semi-stable <lb/>rank n and degree n g framed holomorphic vector bundles as shown by Tyurin <lb/>[106]. Hence, the name Tyurin data. <lb/>We consider g-valued meromorphic functions <lb/> 5 <lb/> (8.3) <lb/> L : Σ → g, <lb/> which are holomorphic outside W ∪ A, have at most poles of order one (respectively <lb/>of order two for sp(2n)) at the points in W , and fulfill certain conditions at W <lb/> depending on T . To describe them let us fix local coordinates w  s  centered at γ  s  , <lb/> s = 1, . . . , R. For gl(n) the conditions are as follows. For s = 1, . . . , R we require <lb/>that there exist β  s  ∈ C <lb/> n  and κ  s  ∈ C such that the function L has the following <lb/>expansion at γ  s  ∈ W <lb/> (8.4) <lb/> L(w  s  ) = <lb/> L  s,−1 <lb/> w  s <lb/> + L  s,0  + <lb/> k&gt;0 <lb/> L  s,k  w <lb/> k <lb/>s  , <lb/> with <lb/>(8.5) <lb/> L  s,−1  = α  s  β <lb/> t <lb/>s  , tr(L  s,−1  ) = β <lb/> t <lb/>s  α  s  = 0, L  s,0  α  s  = κ  s  α  s  . <lb/> In particular, if L  s,−1  is non-vanishing then it is a rank 1 matrix, and if α  s  = 0 <lb/>then it is an eigenvector of L  s,0  . The requirements (8.5) are independent of the <lb/>chosen coordinates w  s  . <lb/>It is not at all clear that the commutator of two such matrix functions fulfills <lb/>again these conditions. But it is shown in [59] that they indeed close to a Lie <lb/>algebra (in fact in the case of gl(n) they constitute an associative algebra under <lb/>the matrix product). If one of the α  s  = 0 then the conditions at the point γ  s <lb/> correspond to the fact, that L has to be holomorphic there. If all α  s  &apos;s are zero <lb/>or W = ∅ we obtain back the current algebra of KN type. For the algebra under <lb/>consideration here, in some sense the Lax operator algebras generalize them. In <lb/>the bundle interpretation of the Tyurin data the KN case corresponds to the trivial <lb/>rank n bundle. <lb/>For sl(n) the only additional condition is that in (8.4) all matrices L  s,k  are <lb/>trace-less. The conditions (8.5) remain unchanged. <lb/>In the case of so(n) one requires that all L  s,k  in (8.4) are skew-symmetric. In <lb/>particular, they are trace-less. Following [59] the set-up has to be slightly modified. <lb/>First only those Tyurin parameters α  s  are allowed which satisfy α <lb/> t <lb/>s  α  s  = 0. Then, <lb/>(8.5) is changed in the following way: <lb/>(8.6) <lb/> L  s,−1  = α  s  β <lb/> t <lb/>s  − β  s  α <lb/> t <lb/>s  , tr(L  s,−1  ) = β <lb/> t <lb/>s  α  s  = 0, L  s,0  α  s  = κ  s  α  s  . <lb/> For sp(2n) we consider a symplectic form <lb/>  for C <lb/> 2n  given by a non-degenerate <lb/>skew-symmetric matrix σ. The Lie algebra sp(2n) is the Lie algebra of matrices X <lb/> such that X <lb/> t  σ + σX = 0. The condition tr(X) = 0 will be automatic. At the weak <lb/>singularities we have the expansion <lb/>(8.7) <lb/> L(w  s  ) = <lb/> L  s,−2 <lb/> w  2 <lb/> s <lb/> + <lb/> L  s,−1 <lb/> w  s <lb/> + L  s,0  + L  s,1  w  s  + <lb/> k&gt;1 <lb/> L  s,k  w <lb/> k <lb/>s  . <lb/></body>

			<body> The condition (8.5) is modified as follows (see [59]): there exist β  s  ∈ C <lb/> 2n  , ν  s  , κ  s  ∈ C <lb/> such that <lb/>(8.8) <lb/> L  s,−2  = ν  s  α  s  α <lb/> t <lb/>s  σ, L  s,−1  = (α  s  β <lb/> t <lb/>s  + β  s  α <lb/> t <lb/>s  )σ, β  s <lb/>t  σα  s  = 0, L  s,0  α  s  = κ  s  α  s  . <lb/> Moreover, we require α <lb/> t <lb/>s  σL  s,1  α  s  = 0. Again under the point-wise matrix commu-<lb/>tator the set of such maps constitute a Lie algebra. <lb/>It is possible to introduce an almost-graded structure for these Lax operator <lb/>algebras induced by a splitting of the set A = I ∪ O. This is done for the two-point <lb/>case in [59] and for the multi-point case in [90]. From the applications there is <lb/>again a need to classify almost-graded central extensions. <lb/>The author obtained this jointly with O. Sheinman in [95] for the two-point <lb/>case. For the multi-point case see [90]. For the Lax operator algebras associated to <lb/>the simple algebras sl(n), so(n), sp(n) it will be unique (meaning: given a splitting of <lb/> A there is an almost-grading and with respect to this there is up to equivalence and <lb/>rescaling only one non-trivial almost-graded central extension). For gl(n) we obtain <lb/>two independent local cocycle classes if we assume L-invariance on the reductive <lb/>part. Both in the definition of the cocycle and in the definition of L-invariance a <lb/>connection shows up. <lb/> Remark 8.2. Recently, Sheinman extended the set-up to G  2  [103] and more-<lb/>over gave a recipe for all semi-simple Lie algebras [104]. <lb/> 9. Fermionic Fock Space <lb/>9.1. Semi-Infinite forms and fermionic Fock space representations. <lb/> Our Krichever-Novikov vector field algebras L have as Lie modules the spaces F <lb/> λ  . <lb/>These representations are not of the type physicists are usually interested in. There <lb/>are neither annihilation nor creation operators which can be used to construct the <lb/>full representation out of a vacuum state. <lb/>To obtain representation with the required properties the almost-grading again <lb/>comes into play. First, using the grading of F <lb/> λ  it is possible to construct starting <lb/>from F <lb/> λ  the forms of weight λ ∈ 1/2Z, the semi-infinite wedge forms H <lb/> λ  s. <lb/>The vector space H <lb/> λ  is generated by basis elements which are formal expressions <lb/>of the type <lb/>(9.1) <lb/>Φ = f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i1)  ∧ f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i2)  ∧ f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i3)  ∧ · · · , <lb/> where (i  1  ) = (m  1  , p  1  ) is a double index indexing our basis elements. The indices are <lb/>in strictly increasing lexicographical order. They are stabilizing in the sense that <lb/>they will increase exactly by one starting from a certain index, depending on Φ. <lb/>The action of L should be extended by Leibniz rule from F <lb/> λ  to H <lb/> λ  . But a problem <lb/>arises. For elements of the critical strip L  [0]  of the algebra L it might happen that <lb/>they produce infinitely many contributions. The action has to be regularized (as <lb/>physicists like to call it), which is a well-defined mathematical procedure. <lb/>Here the almost-grading has his second appearance. By the (strong) almost-<lb/>graded module structure of F <lb/> λ  the algebra L can be embedded into the Lie algebra <lb/>of both-sided infinite matrices <lb/>(9.2) gl(∞) := {A = (a  ij  )  i,j∈Z  | ∃r = r(A), such that a  ij  = 0 if |i − j| &gt; r }, <lb/></body>

			<body> with  &quot; finitely many diagonals &quot; . The embedding will depend on the weight λ. For <lb/> gl(∞) there exists a procedure for the regularization of the action on the semi-<lb/>infinite wedge product [23], [50], see also [51]. In particular, there is a unique <lb/>non-trivial central extension <lb/> gl(∞). If we pull-back the defining cocycle for the <lb/>extension we obtain a central extension <lb/> L  λ  of L and the required regularization <lb/>of the action of <lb/> L  λ  on H <lb/> λ  . As the embedding of L depends on the weight λ <lb/> the cocycle will depend too. The pull-back cocycle will be local. Hence, by the <lb/>classification results of Section 6.3 it is the unique central extension class defined <lb/>by (6.9) integrated over C  S  (up to a rescaling). <lb/>In H <lb/> λ  there are invariant subspaces, which are generated by a certain &quot; vacuum <lb/>vectors &quot; . The subalgebra L  [+]  annihilates the vacuum, the central element and the <lb/>other elements of degree zero act by multiplication with a constant and the whole <lb/>representation state is generated by L  [−]  ⊕ L  [0]  from the vacuum. <lb/>As the function algebra A operates as multiplication operators on F <lb/> λ  the above <lb/>representation can be extended to the algebra D <lb/> 1  (see details in [80], [91]) after one <lb/>passes to central extensions. The cocycle again is local and hence, up to coboundary, <lb/>it will be a certain linear combination of the 3 generating cocycles for the differential <lb/>operator algebra. In fact its class will be <lb/>(9.3) <lb/> c  λ  [ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C  S  ] + <lb/>2λ − 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>[ψ <lb/> 4 <lb/> C  S  ] − [ψ <lb/> 1 <lb/> C  S  ], <lb/> c  λ  := −2(6λ <lb/> 2  − 6λ + 1). <lb/>Recall that ψ <lb/> 3  is the cocycle for the vector field algebra, ψ <lb/> 1  the cocycle for the <lb/>function algebra, and ψ <lb/> 4  the mixing cocycle. Note that the expression for c  λ  appears <lb/>also in Mumford&apos;s formula [85] relating divisors on the moduli space of curves. <lb/>For L we could rescale the central element. Hence essentially, the central exten-<lb/>sion <lb/> L did not depend on the weight. Here this is different. The central extension <lb/> D  1 λ  depends on it. Furthermore, the representation on H <lb/> λ  gives a projective rep-<lb/>resentation of the algebra of D  λ  of differential operators of all orders. It is exactly <lb/>the combination (9.3) which lifts to a cocycle for D  λ  and gives a central extension <lb/> D  λ  . <lb/>For the centrally extended algebras  g in a similar way fermionic Fock space <lb/>representations can be constructed, see [100], [93]. <lb/> 9.2. b – c systems. Related to the above there are other quantum algebra <lb/>systems which can be realized on H <lb/> λ  . On the space H <lb/> λ  the forms F <lb/> λ  act by wedging <lb/>elements f <lb/> λ  ∈ F <lb/> λ  in front of the semi-infinite wedge form, i.e. <lb/>(9.4) <lb/>Φ → f <lb/> λ  ∧ Φ. <lb/>Using the Krichever-Novikov duality pairing (5.4) and by contracting the elements <lb/>in the semi-infinite wedge forms the forms f <lb/> 1−λ  ∈ F <lb/> 1−λ  will act on them too. For <lb/>Φ a basis element (9.1) of H <lb/> λ  the contraction is defines via <lb/>(9.5) <lb/> i(f <lb/> 1−λ  )Φ = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> l=1 <lb/> (−1) <lb/> l−1  f <lb/> 1−λ  , f <lb/> λ <lb/>i  l <lb/> · f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i1)  ∧ f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i2)  ∧ · · · ˇ <lb/> f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i  l  )  . <lb/> Herě <lb/> f <lb/> λ <lb/> (i  l  )  indicates as usual that this element will not be there anymore. <lb/>Both operations create a Clifford algebra like structure, which is sometimes <lb/>called a b − c system, see [91, Chapters 7 and 8]. <lb/></body>

			<body> 9.3. Vertex algebras. From b − c systems it is not far to describe the math-<lb/>ematical notion of a global operator field. Furthermore, it is possible to describe <lb/>operator product expansions also in the Krichever–Novikov setting. Above we <lb/>discussed fermionic representations. In physics also bosonic representations are <lb/>needed. From the physicists&apos; point of view vertex operators give a &quot; boson-fermion <lb/>correspondence &quot; . <lb/>For the mathematical background of vertex algebras in the classical genus zero <lb/>setting see [48], [52], [34], [49]. We will not recall their definition here. Let me <lb/>only say, that there is a state-field correspondence fulfilling certain axioms. <lb/>It has to be pointed out that vertex algebras do not only play a role in field the-<lb/>ory. They were also crucial in understanding the Monster and Moonshine phenom-<lb/>ena which refers to the fact that the dimensions of the irreducible representations <lb/>of the largest sporadic finite group, the monster group, show up in the coefficients <lb/>of the q-expansion of the elliptic modular function j. This was first seen experi-<lb/>mentally and later explained with the help of representations of a certain vertex <lb/>algebra which was related to the monster. The j-function appears as graded di-<lb/>mension of a representation of this vertex algebra. The details can be found in [34]. <lb/>Also with the help of vertex algebras representations of Kac-Moody algebras can <lb/>be constructed. <lb/>To construct vertex algebras in higher genus there are different strategies. One <lb/>is by some kind of semi-local approach very much in the spirit of Tsuchiya, Ueno <lb/>and Yamada [105]. An example is given by Zhu [108]. Another direction is based <lb/>on an operadic approach. See for example Huang and Lepowsky [42], [43], [44], <lb/>[45]. Also there is a sheaf theoretic approach due to Frenkel and Ben-Zvi [32], [33]. <lb/>A mathematical treatment via the Krichever–Novikov objects which stays very <lb/>close to the axiomatic treatment in genus zero is given by Linde [62], [63]. Strictly <lb/>speaking, he does it only for the two-point case. His objects, as they are formulated <lb/>in terms of the KN basis, should extend to the multi-point situation too. The details <lb/>are not yet done. <lb/>A physicists approach via Krichever–Novikov objects in the context of explicit <lb/>types of field theories and their special properties is given by Bonora and collabo-<lb/>rators [11], [75]. For a general use of KN type algebras in Quantum Field Theory <lb/>by physicists see [91, Section 14.5]. There an extensive list of names and references <lb/>can be found. <lb/> 10. Sugawara Representation <lb/> In the classical set-up the Sugawara construction relates to a representation <lb/>of the classical affine Lie algebra  g a representation of the Virasoro algebra, see <lb/>e.g. [48], [51]. In joint work with O. Sheinman the author succeeded in extending <lb/>it to arbitrary genus and the multi-point setting [92]. For an updated treatment, <lb/>incorporating also the uniqueness results of central extensions, see [91, Chapter <lb/>10]. Here we will give an extremely rough sketch. <lb/>We start with an admissible representation V of a centrally extended current <lb/>algebra  g. Admissible means, that the central element operates as constant × <lb/> identity, and that every element v in the representation space will be annihilated <lb/>by the elements in  g of sufficiently high degree (the degree depends on the element <lb/> v). <lb/></body>

			<body> For simplicity let g be either abelian or simple and β the non-degenerate sym-<lb/>metric invariant bilinear form used to construct  g (now we need that it is non-<lb/>degenerate). Let {u  i  }, {u <lb/> j  } be a system of dual basis elements for g with respect <lb/>to β, i.e. β(u  i  , u <lb/> j  ) = δ <lb/> j <lb/>i  . Note that the Casimir element of g can be given by <lb/> i  u <lb/> i  . <lb/>For x ∈ g we consider the family of operators x(n, p) given by the operation of <lb/> x ⊗ A  n,p  on V . We group them together in a formal sum <lb/>(10.1) <lb/> x(Q) := <lb/> n∈Z <lb/>K <lb/> p=1 <lb/> x(n, p)ω <lb/> n,p  (Q), Q ∈ Σ. <lb/>Such a formal sum is called a field if applied to a vector v ∈ V it gives again a formal <lb/>sum (now of elements from V ) which is bounded from above. By the condition of <lb/>admissibility <lb/> x(Q) is a field. It is of conformal weight one, as the one-differentials <lb/> ω <lb/> n,p  show up. <lb/>The current operator fields are defined as <lb/> 6 <lb/> (10.2) <lb/> J  i  (Q) := <lb/> u  i  (Q) = <lb/> n,p <lb/> u  i  (n, p)ω <lb/> n,p  (Q). <lb/>The Sugawara operator field T (Q) is defined by <lb/>(10.3) <lb/> T (Q) := <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> i <lb/> :J  i  (Q)J <lb/> i  (Q): . <lb/> Here :...: denotes some normal ordering, which is needed to make the product of <lb/>two fields again a field. The standard normal ordering is defined as <lb/>(10.4) <lb/>:x(n, p)y(m, r): := <lb/> x(n, p)y(m, r), (n, p) ≤ (m, r) <lb/>y(m, r)x(n, p), (n, p) &gt; (m, r) <lb/> where the indices (n, p) are lexicographically ordered. By this prescription the <lb/>annihilation operator, i.e. the operators of positive degree, are brought as much as <lb/>possible to the right so that they act first. <lb/>As the current operators are fields of conformal weights one the Sugawara <lb/>operator field is a field of weight two. Hence we write it as <lb/>(10.5) <lb/> T (Q) = <lb/> k∈Z <lb/>K <lb/> p=1 <lb/> L  k,p  · Ω <lb/> k,p  (Q) <lb/>with certain operators L  k,p  . The L  k,p  are called modes of the Sugawara field T or <lb/>just Sugawara operators. <lb/>Let 2κ be the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator in the adjoint representation. <lb/>For g abelian κ = 0. For g simple and β normalized that such the longest roots <lb/>have square length 2 then κ is the dual Coxeter number. Recall that the central <lb/>element t acts on the representation space V as c · id with a scalar c. This scalar <lb/>is called the level of the representation. The key result is (where x(g) denotes the <lb/>operator corresponding to the element x ⊗ g) <lb/> Proposition 10.1. [91, Prop. 10.8] Let g be either an abelian or a simple Lie <lb/>algebra. Then <lb/> (10.6) <lb/>[L  k,p  , x(g)] = −(c + κ) · x(e  k,p  . g) . <lb/></body>

			<body> (10.7) <lb/> [L  k,p  , <lb/> x(Q)] = (c + κ) · (e  k,p  . <lb/> x(Q)) . <lb/> Recall that e  k,p  are the KN basis elements for the vector field algebra L. <lb/> In the next steps the commutators of the operators L  k,p  can be calculated. In <lb/>the case the c+κ = 0, called the critical level, these operators generate a subalgebra <lb/>of the center of gl(V ). If c + κ  = 0 (i.e. at a non-critical level) the L  k,p  can be <lb/>replaced by rescaled elements L <lb/>  * <lb/> k,p  = <lb/> −1 <lb/> c+κ  L  k,p  and we we denote by T [..] the linear <lb/>representation of L induced by <lb/>(10.8) <lb/> T [e  k,p  ] = L <lb/>  * <lb/> k,p  . <lb/> The result is that T defines a projective representation of L with a local cocy-<lb/>cle. This cocycle is up to rescaling our geometric cocycle ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C  S  ,R  with a projective <lb/>connection <lb/> 7  R. In detail, <lb/>(10.9) <lb/> T [[e, f ]] = [T [e], T [f ]] + <lb/> c dim g <lb/> c + κ <lb/>ψ <lb/> 3 <lb/> C  S  ,R  (e, f )id. <lb/>Consequently, by setting <lb/>(10.10) <lb/> T [ˆ e] := T [e], T [t] := <lb/> c dim g <lb/> c + κ <lb/>id . <lb/> we obtain a honest Lie representation of the centrally extended vector field algebra <lb/> L given by this local cocycle. For the general reductive case, see [91, Section 10.2.1]. <lb/> 11. Application to Moduli Space <lb/> This application deals with Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models and Knizhnik-<lb/>Zamolodchikov Connection. Despite the fact, that it is a very important application, <lb/>the following description is very condensed. More can be found in [93], [94]. See <lb/>also [91], [102]. Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) models are defined on <lb/>the basis of a fixed finite-dimensional simple (or semi-simple) Lie algebra g. One <lb/>considers families of representations of the affine algebras  g (which is an almost-<lb/>graded central extension of g) defined over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces <lb/>of genus g with K + 1 marked points and splitting of type (K, 1). The single point <lb/>in O will be a reference point. The data of the moduli of the Riemann surface <lb/>and the marked points enter the definition of the algebra  g and the representation. <lb/>The construction of certain co-invariants yields a special vector bundle of finite <lb/>rank over moduli space, called the vector bundle of conformal blocks, or Verlinde <lb/>bundle. With the help of the Krichever Novikov vector field algebra, and using the <lb/>Sugawara construction, the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connection is given. It is <lb/>projectively flat. An essential fact is that certain elements in the critical strip L  [0] <lb/> correspond to infinitesimal deformations of the moduli and to moving the marked <lb/>points. This gives a global operator approach in contrast to the semi-local approach <lb/>of Tsuchia, Ueno, and Yamada [105]. <lb/></body>
