			<front> Theory of Higgs to tau tau signatures at the LHC <lb/> Hiroshi Yokoya <lb/> Department of Physics, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-8555, Japan <lb/> Abstract <lb/> In this report, selected topics of tau leptons are collected in view of the high-energy collider experiments and <lb/>the Higgs-boson search. Those topics include decay modes, tau-jet tagging, collinear approximation and the tau <lb/>polarization. Using these unique properties of tau leptons, it is possible to observe various properties of the Higgs <lb/>boson or the associated scalars in the extended Higgs models at the LHC. <lb/> Keywords: Higgs boson, tau lepton, collider experiments <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> In 2012, an evidence of the Higgs-boson-like parti-<lb/>cle was observed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider <lb/>experiments (LHC) [1, 2]. To identify the particle as a <lb/>Higgs-boson, its spin and parity properties, as well as <lb/>couplings to the stantard-model particles must be con-<lb/>firmed. Among the charged leptons, e, μ and τ, because <lb/>of that the Yukawa coupling is proportional to the mass <lb/>of the fermion, τ has the largest coupling to the Higgs-<lb/>boson in the standard-model (SM). This is in clear con-<lb/>trast to the gauge coulings which are universal for three <lb/>generations. <lb/>Furthermore, the Yukawa couplings of scalar-bosons <lb/>to charged leptons in the extended Higgs-sector can be <lb/>more enhanced, decays into τ pair may be the dominant <lb/>decay mode. Thus, τ lepton can be the critial probe of <lb/>the Higgs-boson and also the additional scalars. <lb/>In this report, some basic properties of tau leptons are <lb/>briefly introduced in view of the collider experiments, <lb/>and their usage is presented for the signals of Higgs-<lb/>boson and extended scalars into tau leptons at colliders. <lb/> 2. Tau at colliders <lb/> In this section, some basic properties of τ lepton is <lb/>collected in view of the collider experiments. Subjects <lb/>to discuss include the major decay modes, τ-jet tagging, <lb/>collinear approximation and the polarization. <lb/> 2.1. Tau decays <lb/> τ decay always includes ν τ  , thus, missing momentum. <lb/>Leptonic decay includes τ <lb/> − <lb/> → μ <lb/> −  ¯ <lb/> ν μ ν τ  and τ <lb/> − <lb/> → e <lb/> −  ¯ <lb/> ν  e  ν τ <lb/> with the branching ratio of 17.4% and 17.8%, respec-<lb/>tively [3]. The fragmentation functions of these decays <lb/>in the collinear limit are [5] <lb/> F <lb/> L  (z) = <lb/> 4 <lb/>3 <lb/>(1 − z <lb/> 3 ), <lb/>(1a) <lb/> F <lb/> R  (z) = 2(1 − z) <lb/> 2 (1 + 2z) , <lb/> (1b) <lb/>where z is the energy fraction of  to τ. <lb/> Hadronic decay of τ <lb/> −  is characterized by the number <lb/>of charged hadrons, which are mostly π <lb/> −  . 1-prong de-<lb/>cays amount to 50% and 3-prong decays to 15%. These <lb/>are accompanied by a few neutral hadrons, mostly π <lb/> 0 . <lb/>The branching ratio of the τ <lb/> − <lb/> → π <lb/> − <lb/> ν mode is about <lb/>11%. The branching ratio of the τ <lb/> − <lb/> → π <lb/> − <lb/> π <lb/> 0 <lb/> ν mode is <lb/>about 25%, and that of the τ <lb/> − <lb/> → π <lb/> − <lb/> π <lb/> 0 <lb/> π <lb/> 0 <lb/> ν mode is about <lb/>10%. <lb/>The fragmentation functions of the τ → πν mode are <lb/>given as <lb/> F <lb/> π <lb/> L  (z) = 2(1 − z), <lb/> (2a) <lb/> F <lb/> π <lb/> R  (z) = 2z, <lb/>(2b) <lb/></body>

			<body> Figure 1: Branching ratio of tau&apos;s decay modes. <lb/> in the collinear limit [5]. The fragmentation functions <lb/>for the other hadronic decay modes are also known [5, <lb/>4]. <lb/> 2.2. Tau-jet tagging <lb/> At collider experiments, τ is highly boosted, γ τ  = <lb/> E  τ /m τ  1. Thus, decay products of the τ are also <lb/>boosted, and would be found in a same direction of the <lb/>parent τ&apos;s momentum. It is called a τ-jet or a jet with <lb/> τ-tagging. Among the all hadronic jets, τ-jet candidates <lb/>can be identified, for example, by the following criteria; <lb/>a jet with p T  ≥ 10 GeV and |η| ≤ 2.5 which contains 1 or <lb/>3 charged hadrons in a small cone (R = 0.15) centered at <lb/>the jet momentum direction with the transverse energy <lb/>deposit to this small cone more than 95% of the jet. The <lb/>original jet cone (e.g. R = 0.5) acts as an isolation cone <lb/>to reduce the mis-tagging probability for non-tau jets. <lb/>Furthermore, it is possible to extract the pionic τ-jet by <lb/>requiring e.g. that the jet has only one charged track (1-<lb/>prong) and its transverse energy dominates more than <lb/>0.95 of the jet. Typically, at the LHC, about 50-70% <lb/>tagging efficiency with a few percent mis-tagging prob-<lb/>ability for light-flavor jets would be expected [6, 7]. <lb/> 2.3. Collinear approximation <lb/> τ&apos;s decays always include missing energies, which <lb/>make event reconstructions rather complicated. How-<lb/>ever, for an energetic τ, the missing momentum from <lb/>its decay tends to be oriented to the same direction of <lb/>the observed charged track. Therefore, it is a good ap-<lb/>proximation to assume the τ&apos;s momentum direction to <lb/>that of the charged track. The energy fraction of the <lb/> τ to the charge track is only the remaining uncertainty. <lb/>Depending on the process, it could be resolved by us-<lb/>ing the energy-momentum conservation or the on-shell <lb/>condition for the resonance particles. <lb/>At hadron colliders, since only the transverse mo-<lb/>mentum conservation condition are available to resolve <lb/> τ&apos;s momenta from missing momentum, events kinemat-<lb/>ics with up to two τ&apos;s can be reconstructed, if there is no <lb/>other source of large missing transverse momentum [8]. <lb/>On the other hand, at e <lb/> +  e <lb/> −  colliders, all the four compo-<lb/>nents of the energy-momentum conservation are avail-<lb/>able, therefore event kinematics with up to four τ&apos;s can <lb/>be reconstructed [9]. The 4τ event reconstruction at the <lb/>ILC and the LHC is discussed in Sec. 3.2. <lb/> 2.4. Polarization <lb/> The polarization of τ&apos;s is known to be probed by the <lb/>energy distributions of its decay products. The analyz-<lb/>ing power is large for hadronic decay mode, especially <lb/>for single-pionic decay. On the other hand, it is small <lb/>for the leptonic decay mode. With this property, τ is the <lb/>unique indicator to probe the spin structure of the parent <lb/>particle [5, 10]. <lb/>In Fig. 2, polarization dependence of the pionic and <lb/>general τ-jets, which are defined in Sec. 2.2 is shown <lb/>by the numerical simulation using TAUOLA. The pionic <lb/> τ-jet indicates large polarization dependence which re-<lb/>flect the maximum spin analyzing power of the τ → πν <lb/> decay. The generic τ-jet has still measurable polariza-<lb/>tion dependence [11]. <lb/> τ <lb/> π <lb/> z <lb/> 0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1200 <lb/> τ <lb/> j <lb/> z <lb/> 0 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.4 <lb/>0.6 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1000 <lb/>2000 <lb/>3000 <lb/>4000 <lb/>5000 <lb/> Figure 2: Polarization dependence of the energy distributions for the <lb/>pionic tau-jet (left) and the general tau-jet (right) . Red dashed curves <lb/>are for left-handed and blue solid curves are for right-handed. <lb/> 3. Tau and Higgs physics <lb/> Both ATLAS and CMS collaborations have already <lb/>reported the search for the SM Higgs-boson in the h → <lb/> ττ decay mode using the 2011 and 2012 data [12, 13]. <lb/>Although the error is still large, it is consistent with the <lb/>SM predictions. The advantage of this decay mode is <lb/>that it could be observed with various production mech-<lb/>anism, such as the gluon-fusion, vector-boson-fusion <lb/></body>

			<body> and associated Vh production processes. Thus, by mea-<lb/>suring these processes, universality of the h → ττ decay <lb/>and the ratio of the cross-sections for the above produc-<lb/>tion mechanism could be probed. <lb/> 3.1. Multi-Tau signatures at the LHC <lb/> The two Higgs doublet model (THDM) is one of the <lb/>simple extension of the SM Higgs sector. Since it re-<lb/>spects the custodial symmetry, therefore free from the <lb/>constraint by electroweak precision test, namely the ρ-<lb/> parameter. The constraint from the flavor changing neu-<lb/>tral current can be avoided by imposing the Z  2 symme-<lb/>try to the two doublets. Under the symmetry, there are <lb/>four types of Yukawa interactions depending on the Z  2 <lb/> charge assignments. <lb/>An interesting possibility would be the Type-X <lb/>THDM, where one Higgs doublet couples with quarks <lb/>and the other with leptons [14]. In the limit that one <lb/>of the CP-even scalar behave as the SM Higgs-boson, <lb/>the Yukawa couplings of the other scalar-bosons, CP-<lb/> even H, CP-odd A and charged H <lb/> ±  , tend to be lepton-<lb/>specific. Since Yukawa coupling constants are propor-<lb/>tional to the fermion mass, these scalars predominantly <lb/>decay into τ&apos;s for the wide range of the parameter space. <lb/>At hadron colliders, these scalars are produced in pair <lb/>followed by their decays involving τ&apos;s: <lb/> q ¯ <lb/> q → Z <lb/>  * <lb/> → HA → ττττ, <lb/> (3) <lb/> q ¯ <lb/> q <lb/> → W <lb/>  * <lb/> → H(A)H <lb/> ± <lb/> → τττν. <lb/> (4) <lb/>Thus, it would be observed as the multi-τ events (4τ&apos;s <lb/>or 3τ&apos;s). Depending on the decay patterns of τ&apos;s, there <lb/>are various signatures at the LHC [15]. In the Type-X <lb/>THDM, the masses of these scalars are less constrained. <lb/>Thus, the search for the rather light scalars would be <lb/>interesting at the LHC. <lb/>In Ref. [15], detailed simulation studies are per-<lb/>formed and it is shown that these signatures could be <lb/>observed with large signal-to-background ratio by re-<lb/>quiring high-p  T  τ-jets, especially for 4 τ-jets, 3 τ-jets + <lb/> 1 lepton and 2 τ-jets + 2 leptons events. The expected <lb/>background processes are di-boson productions, t ¯ <lb/> t pro-<lb/>duction and V + jets where V = W or Z. The mass <lb/>reconstruction of the scalars is also possible in princi-<lb/>pal, however thousands fb <lb/> −1  of the integrated luminos-<lb/>ity may be required to have enough number of events. <lb/> 3.2. Kinematical reconstruction in the 4-Tau events <lb/> Finally, we consider the event kinematics of the 4τ <lb/>events at the LHC and the ILC. Such events can be a sig-<lb/>nature of the doubly charged scalar bosons in the Higgs <lb/>triplet model (HTM) or the Type-X THDM. It is able <lb/>to replace some τ-jets by leptons which are supposed to <lb/>come from the decay of τ&apos;s. However, the event selec-<lb/>tion to reduce background events becomes more com-<lb/>plicated. <lb/>At the ILC, the event kinematics can be resolved with <lb/>no ambiguity by solving the 4-momentum conservation <lb/>conditions, <lb/> 0 =  p  τ  1  +  p  τ  2  +  p  τ  3  +  p  τ  4  , <lb/> (5) <lb/> √ <lb/> s = E  τ  1  + E  τ  2  + E  τ  3  + E  τ  4  , <lb/> (6) <lb/>with p <lb/> μ <lb/>τ  i  = p <lb/> μ <lb/> j  τi <lb/> /z  i  , where p <lb/> μ <lb/> j  τi <lb/> is the four-momentum of <lb/>the ith τ-jet. <lb/> In Ref. [9] the 4τ event reconstruction is demon-<lb/>strated for the e <lb/> +  e <lb/> − <lb/> → HA → 4τ process where <lb/> H and A are the CP-even and odd scalars in the <lb/>Type-X THDM. In Fig. 3, histograms of the τ-jet <lb/> pair invariant-masses (left) and the reconstructed di-τ <lb/>invariant-masses (right) are plotted. In order to con-<lb/>struct the di-τ invariant-mass from 4τ&apos;s, we choose the <lb/>combination of the opposite-signed τ pair which gives <lb/>the highest p T  pair. <lb/> Figure 3: Two-dimensional histograms of the j  τ  j  τ  invariant-masses <lb/>(left) and the reconstructed ττ invariant-masses (right) for the e  +  e  − → <lb/> HA → 4τ process with m H  = 130 GeV and m A  = 170 GeV. <lb/> At the LHC, it is not the case that the full event <lb/>kinematics is resolved, because only the transverse-<lb/>momentum conservation conditions are available. How-<lb/>ever, when the di-τ&apos;s come from the decay of particles <lb/>with the same mass, it is possible to determine the res-<lb/>onance mass and fully solve the kinematics [16]. The <lb/>method is described as follows: (1) By putting the mass <lb/>of the two resonances to the trial mass M in  , solve the <lb/>system of equations: <lb/> z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 1  p T, j  τ1  + z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 2  p T, j  τ2  + z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 3  p T, j  τ3  + z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 4  p T, j  τ4  = <lb/> Q T  , (7) <lb/>(z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 1  p j  τ1  + z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 2  p j  τ2  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> = (z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 3  p j  τ3  + z <lb/> −1 <lb/> 4  p j  τ4  ) <lb/> 2 <lb/> = M <lb/> 2 <lb/> in  . (8) <lb/>Here, <lb/> Q T  = − <lb/> j  p T, j  is the recoil transverse momen-<lb/>tum from initial-state-radiation (ISR) jets. The equa-<lb/>tions reduce to a quartic equation, therefore up to four <lb/></body>

			<body> solutions are obtained after removing unphysical ones. <lb/>(2) Count the number of solutions over all the available <lb/>4τ events for a given M  in  . Then, see the number-of-<lb/>solution distribution as a function of the trial mass M in  . <lb/>It is observed that the distribution has the largest gradi-<lb/>ent at the true mass.

Therefore, <lb/>by finding the peak, the true mass of the di-τ resonances <lb/>can be determined. <lb/>In Fig. 4, derivatives of the number-of-solution distri-<lb/>butions as a function of the trial mass are plotted for the <lb/>input mass of m H  = 200 GeV, 400 GeV and 600 GeV. <lb/> 0 <lb/> 200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/> Trial Mass [GeV] <lb/> 0 <lb/>100 <lb/>200 <lb/>300 <lb/>400 <lb/>500 <lb/> Derivative <lb/> Figure 4: Derivatives of the number-of-solution distributions as a <lb/>function of the trial mass for the event reconstruction in the 4τ events <lb/>at the LHC.

Summary <lb/> In this report, we have presented some selected top-<lb/>ics of tau leptons, such as decay modes, tau-jet tag-<lb/>ging, collinear approximation and the tau polarization, <lb/>in view of the high-energy collider experiments and the <lb/>Higgs-boson search. Because of that Yukawa couplings <lb/>are proprotional to the mass of the fermion, h → ττ de-<lb/>cay mode has significant branching ratio, thus τ could <lb/>be a critical probe of the SM Higgs-boson or scalars in <lb/>the model with the extended Higgs-sector. <lb/>We present the multi-τ signatures in the Type-X <lb/>THDM, and the kinematical reconstruction technique in <lb/>the 4τ event at the LHC and ILC. Furthermore, using the <lb/>polarization information of the τ from its decay energy <lb/>distribution and its correlation, spin and CP properties <lb/>of the parent particle can be studied. <lb/></body>
