			<body> Introduction <lb/> The genus g GW-potential of a compact symplectic manifold X is a generating <lb/>function for genus g Gromov-Witten invariants. It is a formal function <lb/> F <lb/> g <lb/> X  (t) := <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=0 <lb/> d∈H2(X) <lb/> q <lb/> d <lb/> n! <lb/> [X  g,n,d  ] <lb/> ev <lb/>  * <lb/> 1  (t) ∧ ... ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n  (t), <lb/>on the cohomology space H <lb/>  *  (X, Q{{q}}) over a suitable Novikov ring Q{{q}}. The <lb/>coefficients are defined by integration over virtual fundamental cycles in the moduli <lb/>spaces of degree d genus g stable pseudo-holomorphic curves with n marked points. <lb/>The cohomology classes ev <lb/>  * <lb/> i  (t) are pull-backs from X by the evaluation maps at <lb/>the marked points. <lb/>One may use the natural contraction maps ct : X  g,n,d  → M  g,n  to the Deligne <lb/>– Mumford moduli spaces of marked Riemann surfaces in order to define more <lb/>general potentials by integration over inverse images of boundary strata or of any <lb/>other cycles. <lb/>The potentials F <lb/> g <lb/>X  and their generalizations are expected to obey some univer-<lb/>sal constraints, yet unknown explicitly (see however [4, 12, 13, 22]), but encoded <lb/>implicitly in the topology of the Deligne-Mumford spaces M  g,n  . In a sense, the <lb/>implicit constraints, to be considered as axioms of 2-dimensional Topological Field <lb/>Theory, are the subject of our study in this paper. <lb/>In this paper, we will compute genus g ≥ 2 Gromov-Witten invariants and <lb/>their generalizations with gravitational descendents in the context of equivariant <lb/>Gromov-Witten theory of tori actions with isolated fixed points. Both formulas, <lb/>with and without descendents, are stated in a form applicable to the axiomatic <lb/>version of genus 0 Gromov – Witten theory, namely — to semisimple Frobenius <lb/>structures. Therefore the formulas can be considered as definitions extending the <lb/>genus 0 theory to higher genus in a way consistent — conjecturally — with the <lb/>implicit axioms mentioned above. In (non-equivariant) Gromov-Witten theory, the <lb/>formulas become conjectures expressing higher genus GW-invariants in terms of <lb/>genus 0 GW-invariants of symplectic manifolds with genericly semisimple quantum <lb/>cup-product. <lb/></body>

			<body> ALEXANDER B. GIVENTAL <lb/> 1. Definitions and examples <lb/> 1.1. Frobenius structures. The axiomatic structure of 2D TFT is understood <lb/>well in genus 0 due to R. Dijkgraaf – E. Witten [5], B. Dubrovin [6] and many <lb/>others (see [23]) as the theory of Frobenius manifolds. By definition, a Frobenius <lb/> structure on a manifold H consists of: <lb/>(i) a flat pseudo-Riemannian metric (·, ·), <lb/> (ii) a function F whose 3-rd covariant derivatives F  abc  are structure constants (a • <lb/> b, c) of a Frobenius algebra structure, i.e. associative commutative multiplication • <lb/> satisfying (a • b, c) = (a, b • c), on the tangent spaces T  t  H which depends smoothly <lb/>on t; <lb/> (iii) the vector field of unities 1 of the •-product which has to be covariantly constant <lb/>and preserve the multiplication and the metric. <lb/> Example 1. The genus 0 GW-potential F = F <lb/> 0 <lb/> X  defines a Frobenius structure on <lb/>the super-space H = H <lb/>  *  (X, Q) <lb/> 1  In this example, the metric and the unit vector <lb/>field are translation-invariant and defined by the Poincare intersection pairing and <lb/>by the cohomology class 1 respectively. <lb/> Example 2. Let f (x, t), t ∈ H, be a miniversal deformation (with respect to the <lb/>right equivalence) of the germ f (·, 0) : (C <lb/> m  , 0) → (C, 0) of a holomorphic function <lb/>at an isolated critical point. Then the tangent spaces T  t  H are canonically identified <lb/>with the algebras Q  t  := C{x}/(f  x  ) of functions on the critical schemes crit f (·, t) <lb/> and thus carry a natural multiplication • with unity 1. Let Ω be a holomorphic <lb/>volume form on C <lb/> m  possibly depending on t. The multiplication • is Frobenius <lb/>with respect to the residue pairing <lb/>(φ, ψ) := <lb/>1 <lb/>(2πi)  m <lb/> |fx  1  |=ε1 <lb/> ... <lb/> |fx  m  |=εm <lb/> φ(x)ψ(x) Ω <lb/> f  x1  ...f  xm <lb/> , <lb/> which is known to be non-degenerate on Q  t  (see [19]). According to the theory [25] <lb/>of primitive volume forms there exists a choice of Ω such that the corresponding <lb/>residue metric is flat and constitutes, together with the multiplication •, a Frobenius <lb/>structure on H (see also [3] for a new approach). <lb/>Frobenius manifolds of Examples 1 and 2 come equipped with one more ingredi-<lb/>ent — the Euler vector field E such that •, 1 and (·, ·) are eigenvectors of the Lie <lb/>derivative L  E  with the eigenvalues 0, −1 and 2 − D respectively. Such Frobenius <lb/>structures are called conformal, and D is called their dimension. In the Exam-<lb/>ple 1, D coincides with the complex dimension of the target manifold X, and the <lb/>grading imposed by E originates from grading in cohomology. In Example 2, the <lb/>Euler vector E(t) is given by the class of the function f (·, t) in the algebra Q  t  , <lb/>and D = 1 − 2/h where h is the so called Coxeter number of the singularity [1]. <lb/>Frobenius manifolds in the next example fall out of the conformal class. <lb/> Example 3. Let the Kähler manifold X be endowed with a Hamiltonian Killing <lb/>action of a compact group T . Then one can introduce equivariant GW-invariants <lb/> [15] using T -equivariant cohomology and intersection theory in the moduli spaces <lb/></body>

			<body> X  g,n,d  . The genus 0 equivariant GW-invariants define on H := H <lb/>  * <lb/> T  (X, Q) the struc-<lb/>ture of a Frobenius manifold over the ground ring H <lb/>  *  (BT, Q), the coefficient ring <lb/>of the equivariant cohomology theory. On the other hand, grading in equivariant <lb/>cohomology imposes homogeneity constraints on GW-potentials so that (·, ·), 1 and <lb/> • do have degrees 2 − dim X, −1 and 0 with respect to a suitable Euler vector field <lb/> E. Yet the Frobenius structure is not conformal since elements of the ground ring <lb/>may have non-zero degrees and therefore L  E  is a differentiation only over Q instead <lb/>of the ground ring of the Frobenius structure. <lb/>A Frobenius manifold is called semisimple if the algebras (T  t  H, •) are semisimple <lb/>at generic t. Frobenius structures of Example 1 are semisimple for, say, projective <lb/>spaces and flag manifolds, and are not semisimple for Calabi-Yau manifolds. Let us <lb/>assume now on that the group T in Example 3 is a torus acting on X with isolated <lb/>fixed points only. Then the cup-product in the equivariant cohomology H <lb/>  * <lb/> T  (X, Q) <lb/> is genericly semisimple, resulting in the corresponding Frobenius structure being <lb/>semisimple too. All Frobenius manifolds of Example 2 are semisimple. <lb/>1.2. The formula. Our expression for the higher genus potentials F <lb/> g  of a semisim-<lb/>ple Frobenius manifold H has the form <lb/> e <lb/> g≥2  <lb/> g−1  F <lb/> g  (t)  = <lb/>= [ e <lb/> 2 <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> k,l=0 <lb/> i,j  V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  ∆ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> i <lb/> ∆ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> j <lb/> ∂  Q i <lb/>k <lb/> ∂ <lb/> Q <lb/>j <lb/>l <lb/> j  τ (∆  j  ; Q <lb/> j <lb/> 0  , Q <lb/> j <lb/> 1  , ...) ]  Q  i <lb/>k  =T  i <lb/>k <lb/> , <lb/> (1) <lb/>where V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  , ∆  j  , T <lb/> i <lb/>k  are certain functions of t ∈ H defined at semisimple points, <lb/> i, j = 1, ..., dim H, k, l = 0, 1, 2, ..., and τ is the following Kontsevich – Witten <lb/>tau-function. <lb/> Let c <lb/> (1)  , ..., c <lb/> (n)  denote the 1-st Chern classes of the universal cotangent lines <lb/> over the Deligne – Mumford spaces M  g,n  , i.e. line bundles formed by cotangent <lb/>lines to the curves at the marked points. We put Q(c) = Q  0  +Q  1  c+Q  2  c <lb/> 2  +... where <lb/> Q  i  are formal variables, introduce the genus g descendent potential of X = pt <lb/> F <lb/> g <lb/> pt  (Q) = <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=0 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n! <lb/> M  g,n <lb/> Q(c <lb/> (1)  ) ∧ ... ∧ Q(c <lb/> (n)  ) <lb/>and define <lb/> τ (; Q) = exp{ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> g=0 <lb/> g−1  F <lb/> g <lb/> pt  (Q)}. <lb/>(2) <lb/>As it was proved by M. Kontsevich [20], τ (Q) provides an asymptotic expansion <lb/>of the matrix Airy function and (modulo some re-notation) coincides, as it was <lb/>conjectured by E. Witten [26], with the tau-function of the KdV-hierarchy satisfying <lb/>the string equation. <lb/>In order to define the functions V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  , ∆  i  , T <lb/> j <lb/>k  we have to review the structural <lb/>theory of semisimple Frobenius manifolds [6, 16, 23]. <lb/>1.3. Canonical coordinates, Hessians and stationary phase asymptotics. <lb/> Given a germ of a Frobenius manifold, we introduce coordinates {t <lb/> α  } flat with <lb/>respect to the metric (·, ·), denote {φ  α  } the corresponding frame in the tangent <lb/>bundle, put g  αβ  := (φ  α  , φ  β  ) and (g <lb/> αβ  ) := (g  αβ  ) <lb/> −1  . <lb/></body>

			<body> The associativity constraint of the •-product is expressed by the WDVV-identity <lb/> for the genus 0 potential (we use the summation convention if possible): <lb/> F  αβµ  g <lb/> µν  F  νγδ  = F  αγµ  g <lb/> µν  F  νβδ  = F  αδµ  g <lb/> µν  F  νβγ  . <lb/> It can also be interpreted as commutativity of the following connection operators <lb/> ∇  α  (z) := z∂  α  + φ  α  • on T H and respectively — the compatibility property of the <lb/>following linear PDE system on T <lb/>  *  H for any value of the parameter z  = 0: <lb/> z∂  α  S  β  = F  αβµ  g <lb/> µν  S  ν  . <lb/> (3) <lb/>The system plays an important role in the theory of Frobenius structures, and <lb/>we ought to start with some remarks about its solutions. A fundamental solution <lb/>to (3) can be found in the form of a power z <lb/> −1  -series 1 + z <lb/> −1  S  1  + z <lb/> −2  S  2  + ... <lb/> satisfying the unitary condition S <lb/>  *  (−1/z)S(1/z) = 1 (here &quot; <lb/>  *   &quot; means &quot; adjoint <lb/>relative to (·, ·) &quot; ). Such a solution S is unique up to right multiplication by a <lb/>constant matrix 1 + O(z <lb/> −1  ) satisfying the unitary condition. A choice of such a <lb/>solution is the starting point in Dubrovin&apos;s construction [6] of genus 0 gravitational <lb/>descendents of Frobenius structures. We will review this construction in the section <lb/>3 and respectively will make use of such a fundamental solution in our description <lb/>(22) of higher genus descendent potential. However, both higher genus formulas <lb/>(with or without descendents) require another, asymptorical form of solution to <lb/>the same system (3) which can be constructed for a semisimple Frobenius structure <lb/>as follows. <lb/>Let us assume that the Frobenius manifold is semisimple. In a neighborhood of <lb/>a semisimple point one introduces canonical coordinates {u <lb/> i  (t)} (see [6]). They are <lb/>characterized uniquely up to reordering and additive constants by the property of <lb/> ∂  i  := ∂/∂u <lb/> i  to form the basis of canonical idempotents of the •-product on T  t  H. <lb/> The flat metric (·, ·) is diagonal in canonical coordinates and is therefore determined <lb/>by the non-vanishing functions (∂  i  , ∂  i  ). We put ∆  i  := 1/(∂  i  , ∂  i  ). In singularity <lb/>theory, u  i  are critical values of the Morse functions f (·, t) at the critical points, and <lb/>∆  i  are the Hessians at these points computed in Ω-unimodular coordinate systems. <lb/>Let U denote the diagonal matrix of canonical coordinates diag(u  1  , ..., u  N  ), and <lb/>Ψ denote the transition matrix between the flat and normalized canonical bases: <lb/>∆ <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> i <lb/> du <lb/> i  = <lb/> β  Ψ <lb/> i <lb/>β  dt <lb/> β  . In particular, <lb/> i  Ψ <lb/> i <lb/>α  Ψ <lb/> i <lb/>β  = g  αβ  , Ψ <lb/> i <lb/>µ  g <lb/> µν  Ψ <lb/> j <lb/>ν  = δ  ij  . <lb/> Proposition (see [6, 16]). <lb/> (a) Near a semisimple point the system (3) has a fundamental solution in the <lb/>form of the matrix series : <lb/> S = Ψ(R  0  + zR  1  + z <lb/> 2  R  2  + ...) exp U/z <lb/> (4) <lb/> where R  k  = (R  k  ) <lb/> j <lb/>i  are matrix-functions of u, and R  0  = 1. <lb/> (b) The series solution S can be chosen to satisfy the unitary condition <lb/> (1 + zR  1  + z <lb/> 2  R  2  + ...)(1 − zR <lb/> t <lb/> 1  + z <lb/> 2  R <lb/> t <lb/> 2  − ...) = 1 <lb/>(5) <lb/> (c) The series R = 1 + zR  1  + z <lb/> 2  R  2  + ... in the solution S satisfying the unitary <lb/>condition is unique up to right multiplication by unitary diagonal matrices exp(a  1  z+ <lb/>a  2  z <lb/> 3  + a  3  z <lb/> 5  + ...) where a  k  = diag(a <lb/> 1 <lb/> k  , ..., a <lb/> N <lb/>k  ) are constant. <lb/>(d) In the case of conformal Frobenius structures the series R in a fundamental <lb/>solution S can be chosen homogeneous, and such R is unique and possesses the <lb/>unitary property automatically. <lb/></body>

			<body> Proof. A proof of (d) and (a) is given in [6] and [16]. We will remind below some <lb/>details from [16] in order to justify the additions (b) and (c) needed here. <lb/>Substitution of S = Ψ(1 + ...) exp(U/z) into (3) yields a chain of equations <lb/>(d + W ∧)R  k−1  = [dU, R  k  ], where W = Ψ <lb/> −1  dΨ = [dU, R  1  ], to be solved inductively <lb/>starting with R  0  = 1. First, off-diagonal entries of R  k  are expressed algebraically <lb/>via R  k−1  , then the diagonal terms of R  k  are found by integration from the next <lb/>equation using the fact that [dU, R  k+1  ] has zero diagonal entries. Compatibility <lb/>conditions needed in this procedure are verified in [16]. <lb/>In order to prove (b), let us introduce a temporary notation P  k  = R  k  R <lb/> t <lb/> 0  − <lb/> R  k−1  R <lb/> t <lb/> 1  + ...(−1) <lb/> k  R  0  R <lb/> t <lb/>k  for the z <lb/> k  -term in R(z)R <lb/> t  (−z) = 1 + P  1  z + P  2  z <lb/> 2  + .... A <lb/>short elementary computation shows that [dU, P  k  ] = dP  k−1  + [W, P  k−1  ]. Assuming <lb/>that P  k−1  = 0 (or 1 for k = 0), we conclude that off-diagonal entries of P  k  vanish. <lb/>This already implies P  k  = 0 for odd k since such P  k  are obviously anti-symmetric. <lb/>Now, taking in account that P  k  is diagonal and W = Ψ <lb/> −1  dΨ is anti-symmetric, <lb/>we conclude from the next equation dP  k  + [W, P  k  ] = [dU, P  k+1  ] that the diagonal <lb/>entries of P  k  are constant. For even k we have P  k  = R  k  + R <lb/> t <lb/>k  + ... and thus a unique <lb/>choice of integration constants in the above procedure for finding R  k  will make P  k <lb/> vanish. <lb/>Yet the integration constants for diagonal entries of R  2k−1  are totally ambiguous, <lb/>and it is immediate to see, by induction on k, that this ambiguity is correctly <lb/>accounted by the multiplication R → R exp(a  k  z <lb/> 2k−1  ) described in (c). <lb/>In the conformal case, let E = <lb/> u <lb/> i  ∂  i  denote the Euler field. The Euler formula <lb/> R  k  = −(i  E  dR  k  )/k shows how to recover diagonal entries of R  k  via their differentials <lb/>by an algebraic procedure. This implies existence of a homogeneous solution R. <lb/> Finally, the homogeneity condition leaves no freedom in the choice of the integration <lb/>constants, but it also guarantees that the constant diagonal entries in P  2k  are zeroes. <lb/>This proves (d). <lb/>Let S(z) be the unitary fundamental solution to (3) singled-out in the proposi-<lb/>tion. We introduce a new matrix-function <lb/>[V <lb/> ij  (z, w)] := (z + w) <lb/> −1  [S <lb/> i <lb/>µ  (z)] <lb/> t  [g <lb/> µν  ][S <lb/> j <lb/>ν  (w)]. <lb/>It expands as V <lb/> ij  (z, w) = <lb/> e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z+u <lb/> j  /w <lb/> z + w <lb/> s <lb/> R <lb/> i <lb/>s  (z)R <lb/> j <lb/>s  (w) =: e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z+u <lb/> j  /w  ( <lb/> δ <lb/> ij <lb/> z + w <lb/> + <lb/> ∞ <lb/> k,l=0 <lb/> (−1) <lb/> k+l  V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  z <lb/> k  w <lb/> l  ). <lb/>(6) <lb/>This defines V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  as functions on the Frobenius manifold in a neighborhood of a <lb/>semisimple point. <lb/>Next, in the semisimple Frobenius algebras (T  t  H, •) we have : <lb/>1 = <lb/> δ <lb/> µ  φ  µ  = <lb/> ∂  j  = <lb/> ∆ <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> j <lb/> (∆ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> j  ∂  j  ). <lb/>We expand &quot; the first row &quot; of S(z) <lb/> δ <lb/> µ  S <lb/> i <lb/>µ  (z) = ( <lb/> j <lb/> ∆ <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> j <lb/> R <lb/> i <lb/>j  (z))e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z  =: [1 − <lb/> ∞ <lb/> k=0 <lb/> T <lb/> i <lb/>k  (−z) <lb/> k−1  ] <lb/> e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z <lb/> √ <lb/> ∆  i <lb/> . <lb/> (7) <lb/>This defines T <lb/> i <lb/>k  . In particular, T <lb/> i <lb/> 0  = T <lb/> i <lb/> 1  = 0. <lb/></body>

			<body> Perhaps, the nature of these formulas, the asymptotical solution S(z) and the <lb/>relationship between the two forms of fundamental solutions to (3) will become <lb/>more transparent after the following two examples. <lb/> Example 4. In singularity theory, a fundamental solution matrix to the equation <lb/>(3) is given by complex oscillating integrals of suitable m-forms over suitable m-<lb/> cycles : <lb/> S <lb/> i <lb/> µ  = <lb/> Γ  i  ⊂C  m <lb/> e <lb/> f (x,t)/z  φ  µ  (x, t)Ω . <lb/> The cycles Γ <lb/> i  can be constructed as in Morse theory for the function Re{f (·, t)/z} <lb/> and thus correspond to critical points x <lb/> i  (t) of the function f (·, t). To construct 1/z-<lb/>expansion of the integrals, one first expands the integrals over the levels f = f  crit  −τ <lb/> near τ = ∞ and then describes the oscillating integrals via the Laplace transform. <lb/>Say, for weighted-homeogeneous singularities <lb/> γi <lb/> φ  µ  (x, t) <lb/> Ω <lb/> df (x, t) <lb/> = τ <lb/> dµ  ( <lb/> A <lb/> i <lb/>k,µ  (t)τ <lb/> −k  ), <lb/>where d  µ  is the weight of the form φ  µ  Ω/df . Respectively, <lb/> S <lb/> i <lb/>µ  = <lb/> A <lb/> i <lb/>k,µ <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> 0 <lb/> e <lb/> −τ /z  τ <lb/> dµ−k  dτ = z <lb/> dµ+1 <lb/> A <lb/> i <lb/>k,µ  (t)Γ(d  µ  + 1 − k)z <lb/> −k  . <lb/> Alternatively, one arrives to the expansion (4) via the stationary phase asymp-<lb/>totics of the oscillating integrals near non-degenerate critical points of Morse func-<lb/>tions f (·, t): <lb/> Γ  i <lb/> e <lb/> f (x,t)/z  φ  µ  (x, t) Ω ∼ e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z  ( <lb/> φ  µ  (x <lb/> i  , t) <lb/> √ <lb/> ∆  i <lb/> + ...) <lb/> where u <lb/> i  = f (x <lb/> i  , t) is the critical value and ∆  i  is the Ω-Hessian at the critical point. <lb/>In particular (7) is the stationary phase expansion <lb/> Γ  i <lb/> e <lb/> f /z  Ω ∼ <lb/> e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z <lb/> √ <lb/> ∆  i <lb/> [1 + T <lb/> i <lb/> 2  z − T <lb/> i <lb/> 3  z <lb/> 2  + ...] <lb/> Example 5. In Gromov-Witten theory, a 1/z-series solution to (3) satisfying the <lb/>unitary condition is given by the following matrix of gravitational descendents: <lb/> φ  β  , <lb/>φ  γ <lb/> z − c <lb/> := <lb/> n,d <lb/> q <lb/> d <lb/> n! <lb/> [X  0,2+n,d  ] <lb/> ev <lb/>  * <lb/> 0  (φ  β  ) ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> 1  (t) ∧ ... ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n  (t) ∧ <lb/> ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n+1  (φ  γ  ) <lb/> z − c  (n+1)  . <lb/> (8) <lb/>By definition, the constant g  αβ  is taken on the role of the ill-defined term with <lb/> d = 0, n = 0. This solution is related to the two-point descendent <lb/> φ  α <lb/> z − c <lb/>, <lb/>φ  β <lb/> w − c <lb/> := <lb/> n,d <lb/> q <lb/> d <lb/> n! <lb/> [X  0,2+n,d  ] <lb/> ev <lb/>  * <lb/> 0  (φ  α  ) <lb/> z − c  (0)  ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> 1  (t) ∧ ... ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n  (t) ∧ <lb/> ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n+1  (φ  β  ) <lb/> w − c  (n+1)  . <lb/> (9) <lb/>in the same way as S(z) is related to V (z, w): <lb/> φ  α <lb/> z − c <lb/>, <lb/>φ  β <lb/> w − c <lb/> = <lb/> µν <lb/> φ  α <lb/> z − c <lb/>, φ  µ  g <lb/> µν  φ  ν  , <lb/>φ  β <lb/> z − c <lb/> . <lb/> (10) <lb/>According to the mirror conjecture [14, 16] the descendents (8) can be identified <lb/>with oscillating integrals of the mirror partner.

			<body> ∆ <lb/> i  and T <lb/> i <lb/>k  can be extracted from the stationary phase asymptotics of the integrals. <lb/>In Section 2 (see also [16]), we will find that in the equivariant setting of Example <lb/>3 when the fixed points of the toris action are isolated and respectively the classical <lb/>equivariant cohomology algebra of the target space is semisimple, the series S(z) <lb/> and V (z, w) essentially coincide with the descendents (8) and (9). <lb/> Conjecture 1. With the notations (2,6,7) in force, the formula (1) repre-<lb/>sents higher genus GW-invariants of compact symplectic manifolds with generically <lb/>semisimple quantum cup-product. <lb/> The main reason to believe in the conjectural formula (1) is the theorem in the <lb/>next section and the miraculous coincidences which occur in the proof. We would <lb/>like to mention here one more bit of evidence in its favor. Namely, in the case of <lb/>conformal Frobenius manifolds of dimension N = 2 ( &quot; two primaries &quot; ) our formula <lb/>yields, after some computation, the following genus 2 potential: <lb/> d(3d − 1)(d − 1) <lb/> 2  (3d − 5)(d − 2) <lb/>2880 <lb/>∆  − <lb/> (u  +  − u  −  )  3  , <lb/> where d is the conformal dimension, and u <lb/> ±  are the canonical coordinates. This <lb/>answer coincides with the result found in [9]. <lb/>Note that the potential vanishes in the case d = 1/3 corresponding to the singu-<lb/>larity of type A  2  . This fact agrees with the general conjecture that our formula (1), <lb/>when applied to the Frobenius structures on the miniversal deformations of isolated <lb/>critical points, should give rise to higher genus potentials which extend analytically <lb/>through the bifurcation set (and therefore must vanish for A, D, E-singularities). <lb/> For no apparent reason, the above formula is symmetric about d = 1 (correspond-<lb/>ing to GW-invariants of CP <lb/> 1  ). It would be interesting to find out what is behind <lb/>this symmetry. <lb/>2. Computation in equivariant GW-theory <lb/> In this section, we formulate and prove Theorem 1 confirming the conjectural <lb/>formula (1) in the case of equivariant Gromov – Witten invariants of Hamiltonian <lb/>tori actions with isolated fixed points. Roughly speaking, we will compute the GW-<lb/>invariants using fixed point localization and will see how the formula (1) emerges <lb/>from the combinatorial formalism of summation over graphs. We will first discard <lb/>those factors in localization formulas which are due to the so called Hodge inter-<lb/>section numbers. This will lead us to a (wrong!) higher genus potential formula <lb/>based on a matrix series R(z) corresponding to some reference choice a <lb/> i <lb/>k  = 0 of <lb/>the integration constants of the part (c) of Proposition. Then we will point out a <lb/>new choice of the integration constants a <lb/> i <lb/>k  which compensates for the effect of the <lb/>Hodge integrals and yields a right formula for the higher genus potential. <lb/>2.1. Localization and materialization. Let the torus T act on X with isolated <lb/>fixed points only. Fixed points of the induced action of T on the moduli spaces <lb/> X  g,n,d  can be described as curves formed by legs — 1-dimensional orbits of T  C  in <lb/> X or their multiple covers, — which are connected at joints — nodes or DM-stable <lb/>curves mapped to fixed points X <lb/> T  . Due to multiplicative properties of the Euler <lb/>classes contributions of fixed points into localization formulas essentially factors <lb/>into contributions of legs and joints [21, 18]. (We are assuming for simplicity that <lb/>the 1-dimensional orbits are also isolated. Beyond this assumption, our arguments <lb/></body>

			<body> remain valid but the leg contributions are to be found by integration over suitable <lb/>orbit spaces.) Contributions of fixed point submanifolds can be arranged as the <lb/>sum over strata in Deligne – Mumford spaces in accordance with images of the <lb/>submanifolds under the contraction map ct : X <lb/> T <lb/> g,n,d  → M  g,0  . It is convenient <lb/>to name some elements of T -invariant curves depending on their fate under the <lb/>contraction map. We call vertices those joints of T -invariant curves in X which <lb/>contract to irreducible components of DM-stable (g, 0)-curves. The genus 0 trees <lb/>of legs and joints which contract to (self-)intersection points of these components <lb/>are called edges. The trees which contract to non-singular points are called tails. <lb/> Thinking of a T -invariant curve (may be disconnected) as a collection of vertices <lb/>(DM-stable curves mapped to the fixed points X <lb/> T  ) with arbitrary number of tails <lb/>attached and connected somehow by the edges, we arrive at the fixed point expres-<lb/>sion for the higher genus potential with the standard combinatorics (1) of Wick&apos;s <lb/>formula. Contributions of vertices will be expressible via intersection numbers (2) <lb/>in Deligne – Mumford spaces, while the edge factors and tail factors should be <lb/>extracted from genus 0 GW-invariants of X. <lb/> A key point is that the genus 0 data needed in the localization formulas can be <lb/>written in abstract terms of semisimple Frobenius structures, and vice versa. For <lb/>example, in the GW-theory of X, the sum <lb/> u <lb/> i  of canonical coordinates enumerates <lb/>elliptic curves with a fixed complex structure. Expressing the GW-invariant via the <lb/>sum over fixed point components we can single out the sub-sum where the elliptic <lb/>joint of the curve is mapped to the i-th fixed point in X. It turns out [15] that the <lb/>sub-sum equals u  i  . Another example: let {φ  α  } be the basis of δ-functions at the <lb/>fixed points in localization of H <lb/>  * <lb/> T  (X), so that g <lb/> αβ  = e  α  δ  αβ  where <lb/> e  α  φ  α  is the <lb/>equivariant Euler class of T X. In the fixed point sum for F <lb/> (0) <lb/> ααα  e <lb/> 3/2 <lb/> α  (no summation) <lb/>we single out contributions with the three distinguished marked points belonging <lb/>to the same joint of the curve. The sub-sum turns out to coincide with ∆ <lb/> 1/2 <lb/> α  . We <lb/>refer to [15, 16] for further details of this materialization phenomenon in the theory <lb/>of canonical coordinates. Our computation of higher genus potentials uses some of <lb/>these results along with the standard fixed point localization technique [21, 18] in <lb/>the moduli spaces of stable maps. <lb/>The edge factors mentioned earlier are identified with V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  . First, in the fixed <lb/>point expression for e  i  <lb/> φi <lb/>χ−c  , <lb/> φi <lb/>z−c  we single out contributions of those fixed point <lb/>where the first and the last marked points belong to the same joint of the curve. <lb/>The sum of such contributions turns out to coincide with e <lb/> u <lb/> i  (1/χ+1/z)  /(z + χ) (see <lb/>[16, 14]). Therefore this expression occurs in the localization formula for the one-<lb/>point descendent φ  α  , φ  i  /(z − c) as the factor responsible for the contributions of <lb/>the joints carrying the last marked point. The variable χ is to be replaced by the <lb/>character of the torus action on the leg approaching the joint from the direction of <lb/>the first marked point. Thus the dependence of the descendent on z is transparent <lb/>from the expansion of the factor: e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z  [ <lb/> e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /χ  (−z) <lb/> k  /χ <lb/> k+1  ]. We conclude that the <lb/>matrix [ φ  α  , <lb/> φj <lb/>z−c  <lb/>√ <lb/> e  j  ] (normalized this way) is a unitary solution S of the part (b) <lb/>of Proposition. It is one of the solutions described by the part (b) of Proposition. <lb/>Among the total class of solutions (see part (c)), it is characterized by the property <lb/>that the series R(z) turns into 1 in the limit of classical equivariant cohomology, <lb/>that is when contributions of all non-constant stable maps are neglected. Eventually <lb/>we will have to change this normalization of the solution S in order to compensate <lb/>the effect of Hodge integrals in localization formulas. <lb/></body>

			<body> Processing similarly contributions of the joints carrying the first and last marked <lb/>points in localization formulas for the two-point descendent (9), we extract the edge <lb/>factors mentioned above: <lb/> φ  i <lb/> z − c <lb/>, <lb/>φ  j <lb/> w − c <lb/>√ <lb/> e  i  e  j  = e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z+u <lb/> j  /w  [ <lb/> δ  ij <lb/> z + w <lb/> + <lb/> (−z) <lb/> k  (−w) <lb/> l  (edge factor) <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  ]. <lb/>(11) <lb/>Taking into account (6) and (10) we conclude that the edge factors are identified <lb/>with the coefficients V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  corresponding to the solution S. Note that the weights <lb/> e <lb/> u <lb/> j  /χ  are incorporated into the edge factors. <lb/>Computing contributions of vertices, denote by χ <lb/> i <lb/>r  , r = 1, ..., dim  C  X, the char-<lb/>acters of the torus action on the tangent space to X at the fixed point with the <lb/>index i. The localization formulas require the following intersection numbers in the <lb/>Deligne-Mumford spaces: <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=0 <lb/> e <lb/> −1 <lb/> i <lb/> n! <lb/> Mg,m+n <lb/>  g <lb/>s=1 <lb/> r  (χ <lb/> i <lb/>r  − ρ  s  ) <lb/>(x  1  − c  (1)  )...(x  m  − c  (m)  ) <lb/> ∧ Q(c <lb/> (m+1)  ) ∧ ... ∧ Q(c <lb/> (m+n)  ). <lb/>(12) <lb/>Here ρ  1  , ..., ρ  g  are Chern roots of the Hodge bundle with the fiber H <lb/> 1  (Σ, O  Σ  ) <lb/>  *  , and <lb/> x  1  , ..., x  m  are formal variables. In localization formulas, these variables are replaced <lb/>by some χ <lb/> i <lb/>r  (or their fractions), the characters of the torus action on the m edges <lb/>adjacent to the vertex. The formula (1) accounts for this substitution by matching <lb/>the factors c <lb/> k  x <lb/> −k−1  in (12) with the corresponding edge factors V <lb/> i... <lb/>k...  in (11). <lb/>The series Q(c) = Q <lb/> i <lb/> 0  + Q <lb/> i <lb/> 1  c + ... is to be substituted in the localization formulas <lb/>by the localization factor of the tail approaching the i-th fixed point, and the <lb/>next task is to interpret the factor in terms of abstract Frobenius structures. For <lb/>this, we notice that the same series Q(c) occurs — in the same role — in fixed <lb/>point localization of genus 0 invariants. In particular, the one-point descendent <lb/> φi <lb/>z−c  = z1, <lb/> φi <lb/>z−c  is written as <lb/> z <lb/>e  i <lb/> + <lb/> Q(−z) − Q(0) <lb/>e  i <lb/> + <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=2 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n! <lb/> M0,1+n <lb/> Q(c <lb/> (1)  ) ∧ ... ∧ Q(c <lb/> (n)  ) ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n+1 <lb/> φ  i <lb/> z − c <lb/>. <lb/> When Q <lb/> i <lb/> 0  = 0, it coincides with (z + Q(−z))/e  i  . This can be achieved by moving <lb/>the series Q by the string flow, and the time needed in order to make Q <lb/> i <lb/> 0  = 0 is <lb/>exactly −u  i  (see [15], Section 12, or [16]). Furthermore, both the descendent and <lb/>the potential (12) are eigenfunctions of the string operator ∂/∂Q  0  − <lb/> Q  k+1  ∂/∂Q  k <lb/> (with the eigenvalues 1/z and 1/x  1  +...+1/x  m  ) and of the dilaton operator ∂/∂Q  1  − <lb/> Q  k  ∂/∂Q  k  (with the eigenvalues −1 and 2g − 2 + m respectively). Thus, moving <lb/>along the string flow during the time interval −u <lb/> i  and then along the dilaton flow <lb/>during the time interval ln <lb/> √ <lb/> ∆  i  we make Q <lb/> i <lb/> 0  and Q <lb/> i <lb/> 1  vanish and find the final values <lb/> Q <lb/> i <lb/>k  = T <lb/> i <lb/>k  from (7). The toll to pay consists of the factor ∆ <lb/> g−1+m/2 <lb/>i <lb/> distributed in <lb/>(1) among vertices and edges and the weights exp u <lb/> i  /χ <lb/> i <lb/>r  already incorporated, as <lb/>we remarked earlier, into V <lb/> i... <lb/>k...  . <lb/>2.2. Compensating constants. Yet, with our current definition of V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  and T <lb/> i <lb/>k <lb/> the formula (1) would represent correctly the fixed point localization of higher <lb/>genus potentials only if the Hodge factors in (12) were replaced with the factor <lb/> s,r  χ <lb/> i <lb/>r  = e <lb/> g <lb/>i  (which cancels with other occurrences of e  i  here and there). The <lb/>Hodge factors should be digested as follows. Let N  k  denote Newton symmetric <lb/></body>

In equivariant Gromov – Witten theory for Hamiltonian tori ac-<lb/>tions with isolated fixed points, we obtain the higher genus potential in the form (1) <lb/>by taking <lb/> new  S on the role of the fundamental solution S in (6) and (7). <lb/>Remark. According to the Proposition, the unitary solution <lb/> new  S is charachter-<lb/>ized by the condition that the corresponding series <lb/> new  R(z) turns into the diagonal <lb/>matrix of the compensating constants exp[− <lb/> z <lb/> 2k−1 N  2k−1  (1/χ <lb/> i  ) <lb/>2k−1 <lb/> B  2k <lb/> 2k  ] in the limit of <lb/> classical equivariant cohomology. Thus Theorem 1, under its hypotheses, coin-<lb/>cides with Conjecture 1 where the solution S defined on the basis of Proposition is <lb/>normalized in this particular way. <lb/> Example 6. In genus 1, the differential of the GW-potential was computed by <lb/>fixed point localization in [16]. In our current notation <lb/> dF <lb/> 1 <lb/> X  = <lb/> i <lb/> [ <lb/> V <lb/> ii <lb/> 00 <lb/> 2 <lb/> du <lb/> i  − <lb/> N  1  (1/χ <lb/> i  ) <lb/>24 <lb/> du <lb/> i  + <lb/> d∆  i <lb/> 48∆  i <lb/> ]. <lb/>The first summand represents contributions of cycles of rational curves, that is <lb/>of graphs with one vertex (of type (g, m) = (0, 3)) and one edge. The other two <lb/>summands come from (12) with (g, m) = (1, 1). The middle term is due to the <lb/>Hodge integral <lb/> M  1,1 <lb/>  ρ  s  = 1/24. It can be interpreted as contributions of cycles <lb/>of rational curves shrinking to a point and is incorporated into the first term as <lb/> new  V <lb/> ii <lb/> 00  = V <lb/> ii <lb/> 00  − N  1  (1/χ <lb/> i  )/12. This change of notation agrees with the theorem <lb/>since B  2  /2 = 1/12. We arrive at the conjecture [16] making sense for arbitrary <lb/>semisimple Frobenius manifolds: <lb/> dF <lb/> 1  = <lb/> i <lb/> [ <lb/> V <lb/> ii <lb/> 00 <lb/> 2 <lb/> du <lb/> i  + <lb/> d∆  i <lb/> 48∆  i <lb/> ]. <lb/>In the case of conformal Frobenius structures the conjecture was proved in [7] <lb/>by showing that this is the only homogeneous formula that agrees with Getzler&apos;s <lb/>equation [12]. <lb/>2.3. Hodge intersection numbers. We have already explained why the formula <lb/>(1) for higher genus potentials would arise if the Hodge factors in the vertex con-<lb/>tributions (12) were neglected.

			<body> this, let us introduce the generating function for Hodge intersection numbers: <lb/> λ(; Q; s  1  , s  2  , ...) = exp{ <lb/> ∞ <lb/> g=0 <lb/> g−1  H <lb/> g,n <lb/>pt  (Q, s  1  , s  2  , ...)} <lb/> (13) <lb/>where <lb/> H <lb/> g,n <lb/>pt  := <lb/> ∞ <lb/> n=0 <lb/> 1 <lb/> n! <lb/> Mg,n <lb/> Q(c <lb/> (1)  ) ∧ ... ∧ Q(c <lb/> (n)  ) ∧ e <lb/> s  k  N  2k−1  (ρ)/(2k−1)!  . <lb/> We can introduce a family of fake higher genus potentials depending on the pa-<lb/>rameters {s <lb/> i <lb/>k  } by replacing the factors τ (∆  i  ; Q <lb/> i  ) in (1) with λ(∆  i  ; Q <lb/> i  ; s <lb/> i <lb/> 1  , s <lb/> i <lb/> 2  , ...). <lb/> The actual higher genus potential corresponds to s <lb/> i <lb/>k  = −(2k − 2)! N  2k−1  (1/χ <lb/> i  ). We <lb/>claim that the s-parametric deformation of (1) is identified with the a-parametric <lb/> deformation of the fundamental solution S described in the part (c) of Proposition <lb/>by taking a <lb/> i <lb/>k  = B  2k  s <lb/> i <lb/>k  /(2k)! This obviously implies the Theorem. <lb/>Following (6) and (7) with scalar R(z) = exp(a  1  z + a  2  z <lb/> 3  + ...) and ∆ = 1, we <lb/>introduce the operator P (a  1  , a  2  , ...) = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/>  v  kl  (a)∂  ˜ <lb/> Q  k <lb/> ∂  ˜ <lb/> Q  l <lb/> where <lb/>1 <lb/> z + w <lb/> + <lb/> v  kl  (a  1  , a  2  , ...) (−z) <lb/> k  (−w) <lb/> l  := <lb/>exp{ <lb/> a  k  (z <lb/> 2k−1  + w <lb/> 2k−1  )} <lb/> z + w <lb/> (14) <lb/>and define a substitutioñ <lb/> Q(Q, s) by <lb/> z + ˜ <lb/> Q(−z) := [z + Q(−z)] exp[ <lb/> a  k  z <lb/> 2k−1  ]. <lb/>(15) <lb/> Lemma. <lb/> λ(; Q; s  1  , s  2  , ...) = [e <lb/> P ( <lb/> B 2 <lb/>2!  s1, <lb/> B 4 <lb/>4!  s2,...)  τ (; ˜ <lb/> Q)]  ˜ <lb/> Q=  <lb/> (Q, <lb/> B 2 <lb/>2!  s1, <lb/> B 4 <lb/>4!  s2,...) <lb/> Our claim follows formally from Lemma. Indeed, the a-parametric modification <lb/> new  S = S exp( <lb/> a  k  z <lb/> 2k−1  ) of the fundamental solution affects the values Q <lb/> i <lb/>k  = T <lb/> i <lb/>k <lb/> by some linear transformation and also changes coefficients V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  of the differential <lb/>operator in the exponent of (1). Instead of changing the values T <lb/> i <lb/>k  one can make <lb/>the change of the variables Q <lb/> i  → ˜ <lb/> Q <lb/> i  and leave the values Q <lb/> i <lb/>k  = T <lb/> i <lb/>k  unchanged. <lb/>The change of variables coincides with (15). The same change of variables in the <lb/>differential operator accounts for the most of the change in the coefficients V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  . <lb/>The only remaining discrepancy comes from the term δ  ij  /(z + w) in (6) and is <lb/>determined by (14) as <lb/> new  V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  = V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  + δ  ij  v  kl  (a <lb/> i <lb/> 1  , a <lb/> i <lb/> 2  , ...). Thus <lb/> i  ∆  i  P (a <lb/> i  ) is <lb/>added to the differential operator in the exponent of (1). According to Lemma <lb/>the modification is equivalent to using λ(; Q; s)&apos;s (instead of τ (; Q) in (1)) when <lb/> a <lb/> i <lb/>k  = B  2k  s <lb/> i <lb/>k  /(2k)! <lb/> Proof of the lemma. It is known [10], at least in principle, how to compute λ <lb/> in terms of τ using Mumford&apos;s Grothendieck -Riemann -Roch formula [24] for <lb/>the Chern character − <lb/> N  2k−1  (ρ)/(2k − 1)! of the Hodge bundle. Moreover, the <lb/>formula is interpreted in [11] as the PDE-system <lb/> ∂ <lb/>∂s  m <lb/> λ = <lb/> B  2m <lb/> (2m)! <lb/>(D  m  + L  m  )λ, m = 1, 2, ... <lb/> (16) <lb/>where D  m  := <lb/> 1 <lb/>2 <lb/> k+l=2m−2  (−1) <lb/> k  ∂  Q  k  ∂  Q  l  and L  m  := ∂  Q2m  − <lb/>  ∞ <lb/> k=0  Q  k  ∂  Q  k+2m−1  . <lb/>The operators D  m  + L  m  commute pairwise. The vector fields L  m  on the space of <lb/>power series Q(c) = Q  0  + Q  1  c + ... are linear with respect to the origin shifted to <lb/> c.

Generalization to gravitational descendents <lb/> The genus g descendent GW-potential of X is a formal function on the space of <lb/>curves t = t  0  + t  1  c + t  2  c <lb/> 2  + ... in H defined by <lb/> F <lb/> g <lb/>X  (t) := <lb/> n,d <lb/> q <lb/> d <lb/> n! <lb/> [X  g,n,d  ] <lb/> ev <lb/>  * <lb/> 1  t(c <lb/> (1)  ) ∧ ... ∧ ev <lb/>  * <lb/> n  t(c <lb/> (n)  ). <lb/>(17) <lb/>Here c <lb/> (i)  is the 1-st Chern class of the universal cotangent line over X  g,n,d  at the <lb/> i-th marked point, and ev <lb/>  * <lb/> i  acts on coefficients t  m  of the series t. We present <lb/>here a conjectural formula for higher genus descendent potentials that makes sense <lb/>for arbitrary semisimple Frobenius structures. For this, we have to review the <lb/>construction [6] of genus 0 descendents of Frobenius manifolds. <lb/>3.1. Descendents in genus 0. One starts with a fundamental solution 1+z <lb/> −1  S  1  + <lb/> z <lb/> −2  S  2  + ... to the system (3) satisfying the unitary condition and takes it on the <lb/>role of the one-point descendent (8): <lb/>(φ  α  , φ  µ  /(z − c)g <lb/> µβ  ) := 1 + <lb/> k&gt;0 <lb/> z <lb/> −k  (φ  α  , φ  µ  c <lb/> k−1  <lb/> ′  g <lb/> µβ  ) := 1 + <lb/> k&gt;0 <lb/> z <lb/> −k  S  k  . <lb/> We emphasize that the 1/z-series solution is considered disjoint from the asymp-<lb/>totical solution S = ΨR(z) exp(U/z) of the Proposition. In particular, in equivari-<lb/>ant GW-theory the one-point descendent correlators, defined intrinsicly, form the <lb/>fundamental solution series in question, and this definition is not affected by the <lb/>modification R → <lb/> new  R of integration constants in the series R. <lb/> Next, one introduces the 2-point descendent (9) using (10): <lb/> φ  α <lb/> z − c <lb/>, <lb/>φ  β <lb/> w − c <lb/> = <lb/> g  αβ <lb/> z + w <lb/> + <lb/> φ  α  c <lb/> m  , φ  β  c <lb/> l  <lb/> ′ <lb/> z  m+1  w  l+1  := φ  µ  , <lb/>φ  α <lb/> z − c <lb/> g <lb/> µν <lb/> z + w <lb/> φ  ν  , <lb/>φ  β <lb/> w − c <lb/> . <lb/> (18) <lb/>The singular term is present to make the sum satisfy the string equation but it <lb/>makes the symbol ·, · not entirely bilinear. We use here the notation ·, · <lb/> ′  for the <lb/>honest bilinear 2-point descendents. <lb/>Furthermore, one considers the map <lb/> t → t(t) = crit t(c) − c, 1(t) <lb/>(19) <lb/>from the curve space to the Frobenius manifold defined by taking the critical point <lb/>of the function t(c) − c, 1 := (t  0  , t) + t(c) − c, 1 <lb/> ′  of t ∈ H depending linearly on <lb/>the parameter t = t  0  + t  1  c+ .... One can show that the equation of the critical point <lb/>takes on the form t <lb/> α  = t <lb/> α <lb/> 0  + g <lb/> αµ  φ  µ  , (t(c) − t(0))/c(t) and thus admits a unique <lb/>formal solution which turns into t = t  0  when t  1  = t  2  = ... = 0. Finally one puts <lb/> F <lb/> 0  (t) = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> t(c) − c, t(c) − c <lb/> ′  (t(t)) <lb/>(20) <lb/>As it is shown in [6], the formula (20) agrees with the string equation and the genus <lb/>0 topological recursion relation and is the only deformation of F <lb/> 0  |  t1=t2=...=0  = <lb/></body>

Descendents in higher genus. Our proposal for higher genus descendent <lb/>potential has the same form as (1): <lb/> e <lb/> g≥2  <lb/> g−1  F <lb/> g  (t)  = [ e <lb/> 2 <lb/> V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl <lb/> √ <lb/> DiDj ∂  Q i <lb/>k <lb/> ∂ <lb/> Q <lb/>j <lb/>l <lb/> j <lb/> τ (D  j  ; Q <lb/> j  ) ]  Q  i <lb/>k  =T  i <lb/>k <lb/> . <lb/> (22) <lb/>The functions V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  , D  i  , T <lb/> i <lb/>k  on the curve space are defined near a semisimple point <lb/> t(0) in terms of genus 0 descendents. The definitions are motivated by computation <lb/>of higher genus descendent potentials in equivariant GW-theory in the presence of <lb/>the torus acting on the target space with isolated fixed points. The result of the <lb/>computation is stated in Theorem 2 below. The proof of Theorem 2 follows is <lb/>identical to the proof of Theorem 1 given in Section 2, with one deviation which is <lb/>discussed presently. In the part of the text preceeding the formulation of Theorem <lb/>2 we assume that the reader is familiar with the details of Section 2. <lb/>Let us remind from Section 2 that the formula (22) with the combinatorial <lb/>structure of a graph sum originates from the technique of fixed point localization in <lb/>moduli spaces of stable maps, and that the edge and tail factors are to be extracted <lb/>from the genus 0 descendents. In particular the edge factors in localization formulas <lb/>are extracted from the expansion (11) for 2-point correlators on the curve space. <lb/>Due to (21) all such 2-point correlators coincide with the corresponding 2-point <lb/>descendents on H lifted to the curve space by the change of variables (19). This <lb/>also applies to u <lb/> i  = u <lb/> i  (t(t)) (which can be described via 2-point correlators, see <lb/>[15, 16]) and therefore — to the edge factors: <lb/> V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  (t) = V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  (t(t)) where t(t) is defined by (19). <lb/>(23) <lb/>We stress that in the present context of fixed point localization the edge factors <lb/> V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  will eventually have to be the same as in Theorem 1 (i. e. based on the solution <lb/> new  S modified by the Bernoulli constants) in order to compensate the effect of <lb/>Hodge integrals. <lb/>Similarly, the functions D  i  and T <lb/> i <lb/>k  in the localization formulas are found from <lb/>the expansion of the 1-point correlator on the curve space: <lb/> √ <lb/> e  i  <lb/> φ  i <lb/> z − c <lb/> (t) = <lb/> e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z <lb/> √ <lb/> D  i <lb/> (z + <lb/> T <lb/> i <lb/>k  (−z) <lb/> k  ). <lb/>However — and this is the point that makes the difference — <lb/> φi <lb/>z−c  no longer <lb/>coincides with the 2-point correlator z1, <lb/> φi <lb/>z−c  and respectively D  i  and T <lb/> i <lb/>k  are <lb/>not obtained from ∆  i  and T <lb/> i <lb/>k  by the substitution t(t). We need (18–21) in order <lb/>to interpret them in terms of abstract Frobenius structures. Let us recall that <lb/>the asymptotical solution S <lb/> i <lb/>µ  (z) in the context of fixed point localization actually <lb/>coincides with φ  µ  , <lb/> φi <lb/>z−c  <lb/>√ e  i  . We have <lb/> √ e  i  <lb/> φ  i <lb/> z − c <lb/> = <lb/> S <lb/> i <lb/>µ  (z)g <lb/> µν <lb/> φ  ν  , <lb/>φ  α <lb/> w − c <lb/> (t <lb/> α  (w) − δ <lb/> α  w) <lb/> 2πi(z + w) <lb/>dw. <lb/></body>

Here the notation S <lb/> i <lb/>µ  (z) = e <lb/> u <lb/> i  /z  ( <lb/> (R  k  ) <lb/> i <lb/>j  z <lb/> k  )Ψ <lb/> j <lb/>µ  in the <lb/>context of localization formulas should eventually refer to <lb/> new  S, the fundamental <lb/>solution matrix modified by the Bernoulli constants. <lb/> We take (23) and (24) on the role of definitions for V <lb/> ij <lb/>kl  , T <lb/> i <lb/>k  and D  i  in the <lb/>formula (22). <lb/> By definition T <lb/> i <lb/> 1  = 0 while T <lb/> i <lb/> 0  = 0 follows from the criticality condition in (19). <lb/>It is straightforward to check that the definition reduces to (6,7) when t  1  = t  2  = <lb/> ... = 0. With these definitions in force, and the compensating constants in R(z) in <lb/>place, we arrive at the following theorem. <lb/> Theorem 2. The formula (22) for higher genus descendent potentials holds true <lb/>in equivariant GW-theory of Hamiltonian tori actions with isolated fixed points. <lb/>Example 7. We compute from (24) that <lb/> D <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> i <lb/> (t) = ∆ <lb/> −1/2 <lb/> i <lb/> [ <lb/> ∂u <lb/> i <lb/> ∂t  µ  g <lb/> µν  φ  ν  , 1, 1, c − t(c)](t(t)). <lb/> Along the lines of Example 6 we get dF <lb/> 1  = <lb/>= <lb/> ( <lb/> V <lb/> ii <lb/> 00 <lb/> 2 <lb/> du  i  + <lb/> dD  i <lb/> 48D  i <lb/> ) = d{F <lb/> 1  (t(t)) − <lb/> 1 <lb/>24 <lb/>ln[ <lb/> i <lb/> ∂u <lb/> i <lb/> ∂t  µ  g <lb/> µν  φ  ν  , 1, 1, c − t(c)]}. <lb/> This answer actually coincides with the well-known result [5] <lb/> F <lb/> 1  (t) = F <lb/> 1  (t(t)) + <lb/>1 <lb/>24 <lb/>ln det[ <lb/> ∂t <lb/> µ <lb/> ∂t  ν <lb/> 0 <lb/> ]. <lb/>Indeed, differentiating the criticality condition φ  δ  , 1, c − t(c) = 0 in (19) we find <lb/>that g <lb/> αε  φ  ε  , φ  β  , 1, c − t(c)(t(t)) form the matrix inverse to [∂t <lb/> µ  /∂t <lb/> ν <lb/> 0  ]. On the other <lb/>hand, the genus 0 topological recursion relation (or WDVV-equation) implies <lb/> g <lb/> αε  φ  ε  , φ  β  , 1, c − t(c) = g <lb/> αε  φ  ε  , φ  β  , φ  µ  g <lb/> µν  φ  ν  , 1, 1, c − t(c). <lb/> In other words, [∂t/∂t  0  ] <lb/> −1  coincides with the linear combination with coefficients <lb/> g <lb/> µν  φ  ν  , 1, 1, c−t(c) of the commuting matrices [g <lb/> αε  F <lb/> 0 <lb/> εµβ  ] of quantum multiplication <lb/>operators φ  µ  •. Thus the eigenvalues of the matrix are the linear combinations <lb/>(∂u <lb/> i  /∂t <lb/> µ  )g <lb/> µν  φ  ν  , 1, 1, c − t(c), and the determinant is their product. <lb/> Example 8. Consider GW-theory with the target space X = pt. Then u = t, <lb/> 1, 1/(z − c) = exp(t/z) and respectively ∆ = 1 and V  kl  = 0. We find the RHS <lb/>in (22) equal to τ (D; T) with D and T  k  computed as follows. We have f (t; t) := <lb/> 1, 1, t(c) − c(t) = <lb/> t  k  t <lb/> k  /k! − t. The relation (19) turns into f (t(t); t) = 0, while <lb/> D <lb/> −1/2  = −f <lb/> ′  (t(t); t), and <lb/> T  1  − 1 = f <lb/> ′  (t(t); t) <lb/> √ <lb/> D, T  2  = f <lb/> ′′  (t(t), t) <lb/> √ <lb/> D, T  3  = f <lb/> ′′′  (t(t); t) <lb/> √ <lb/> D, ... <lb/> Note that (t  k  − δ  k,1  ) → ∂ <lb/> k  f (t; t)/∂t <lb/> k  is the string flow on the curve space so that <lb/> T is obtained from t by applying the string flow until t  0  = 0 and then applying <lb/>the dilaton flow until t  1  = 0. The potentials F <lb/> g <lb/>pt  (t) with g = 0, 1 vanish when <lb/> t  0  = t  1  = 0, and for g ≥ 2 are preserved by the string flow and are homogeneous of <lb/></body>

			<body> degree 2 − 2g with respect to the dilaton flow. We conclude that indeed τ (D; T) <lb/> coincides with exp <lb/> g≥2  <lb/> g−1  F <lb/> g <lb/>pt  (t). <lb/>Finally, the formulas (22–24) agree with our Lemma about Hodge intersection <lb/>numbers in the following sense: the Lemma follows formally from our claim that, <lb/>in the current setting with descendents as well, the s-deformation (13) of (2) is <lb/>compensated by the modification exp(u/z) → exp(u/z + B  2  s  1  z/2! + B  4  s  2  z <lb/> 3  /4! + ...) <lb/> described in the part (c) of Proposition. <lb/> Conjecture 2. With the notations (2,23,24) in force, the formula (22) repre-<lb/>sents higher genus gravitational descendents of compact symplectic manifolds with <lb/>generically semisimple quantum cup-product. <lb/>Remark. Generally speaking, the task of deriving Conjectures 1 and 2 from <lb/>Theorems 1 and 2 by passing to the non-equivariant limit is open and non-trivial. <lb/>We will show in [17] how to do this in the case of complex projective spaces and <lb/>their products. <lb/>3.3. Concluding remarks. The proposal (1,22) should be exposed to further <lb/>tests. We expect it to be consistent with any relations in cohomology of Deligne– <lb/>Mumford spaces (see [12, 13] for some such ralations found in genus 0 and 2). In <lb/>fact we hope that our Theorems 1 and 2 on equivariant GW-potentials impose some <lb/>constraints on topology of Deligne–Mumford spaces so tight that the corresponding <lb/>results in abstract semisimple GW-theory would follow. Respectively, it should be <lb/>interesting to make such constraints as explicit as possible and to understand better <lb/>the geometrical structure on Frobenius manifolds encrypted by (1) and (22). To this <lb/>end, we should say that the formulas (1,22) can be rewritten differently. Using the <lb/>Fourier transform they can be given a form of path integrals. Substituting matrix <lb/>Airy integrals for the Kontsevich – Witten function (2) we can relate the formulas <lb/>to multi-matrix models. Perhaps, the most useful is the representation-theoretic <lb/>formulation [17], which automatically restores the (descendent) potentials of genus <lb/>0 and 1 and yields a formula for the complete tau-function exp[ <lb/> g≥0  h <lb/> g−1  F <lb/> g  ]. It <lb/>enables us to show (see [17]) that the proposal agrees with the Virasoro constraints <lb/>[8] and to derive the &quot; Virasoro conjecture &quot; for GW-invariants of complex projective <lb/>spaces and their products. We also expect the formula for the tau-function to be <lb/>helpful in the construction of the bihamiltonian structure of the KdV-like integrable <lb/>hierarchy whose approximations are studied in [6, 7, 8, 9]. <lb/> Acknowledgments <lb/> The author would like to thank the National Science Foundation for financial <lb/>support.
