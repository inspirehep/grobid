The observational capabilities are mainly limited by the geometrical dimensions and the mass of <lb/>the calorimeter. Since deployable mass depends on the design of the detector and the total mass of the <lb/>payload, it is important to optimize the geometrical acceptance of the calorimeter for rare events, its <lb/>granularity for particle identification, and its absorption depth for the measurement of the particle <lb/>energy. A design of a calorimeter that could simultaneously optimize these characteristics assuming a <lb/>mass limit of about 1.6 t has been studied. As a result, a homogeneous calorimeter instrumented with <lb/>cesium iodide (CsI) crystals was chosen as the best compromise given the total mass constraint. The most <lb/>suitable geometry found is cubic and isotropic, so as to detect particles arriving from every direction in <lb/>space, thus maximizing the acceptance; granularity is obtained by filling the cubic volume with small <lb/>cubic CsI crystals. The total radiation length in any direction is very large, and allows for optimal <lb/>electromagnetic particle identification and energy measurement, while the interaction length is at least <lb/>sufficient to allow a precise reconstruction of hadronic showers. Optimal values for the size of the <lb/>crystals and spacing among them have been studied. Two prototypes have been constructed and <lb/>preliminary tests with high energy ion and muon beams are reported. <lb/> &amp; 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. <lb/></front>

			<body> 1. Introduction <lb/> The all-particle cosmic-ray energy spectrum – extending from a <lb/>few tens of GeV up to the highest detected energies of roughly <lb/>10 <lb/> 20 eV – follows a power law broken around the PeV range. In this <lb/>region a softening of the spectrum is observed (the so-called <lb/> &quot; knee &quot; ), which carries information about the physics of acceleration <lb/>and propagation of cosmic rays. In particular, the origin of the knee, <lb/>albeit still debated, is believed to be due to intrinsic energy limits of <lb/>the acceleration process (mainly supernovae explosions) or to the <lb/>particle leakage from our Galaxy or to a combination of both [1]. <lb/>Given the rapidly decreasing intensity of the flux with energy, until <lb/>now observations around the region of the knee have been carried <lb/>out by ground-based experiments. These experiments rely on the <lb/>observation of the fluorescence and Cherenkov light produced by <lb/>air showers initiated by the interactions of primary cosmic rays <lb/>with the top of the atmosphere, as well as the detection of the <lb/>penetrating particle component of the showers [2–4]. Despite the <lb/>advantage of a very large exposure, these techniques rely on MC <lb/>simulations for energy reconstruction and particle identification. On <lb/>the other hand, direct-detection experiments can identify the <lb/>particle species by means of several techniques including ionization <lb/>measurements; however, balloon-borne [5–7] and space-based <lb/>[8–10] experiments suffer from limited exposure time and a small <lb/>geometrical factor. An experimental breakthrough would therefore <lb/>require a large acceptance, long-duration, space-based experiment <lb/>to collect a statistically significant amount of data in the knee <lb/>region. According to the poly-gonato model [11], one can expect ∼4 <lb/> protons and 8 helium nuclei above 4 PeV for a 1 m <lb/> 2 sr acceptance <lb/>and a 10 years exposure. In order to observe the knee, a calorimeter <lb/>with a geometric factor of at least a few m <lb/> 2 sr with an energy <lb/>resolution for hadrons of ∼40% or better is therefore mandatory <lb/>[12]. Such a device could also obtain significant results for the <lb/>observation of the electron+positron component. Signals from new <lb/>physics like dark matter annihilation/decay [13,14] or nearby <lb/>astrophysical sources [15] might show up in this observational <lb/>channel. Recent measurements show some spectral features in the <lb/>electron/positron components [16,17], although not all of them are <lb/></body>

			<body> confirmed by other independent measurements[18]. A large <lb/>acceptance device with an energy resolution of 1%–2% for <lb/>electrons would allow precise spectral studies also at energies <lb/>above 1 TeV, where the electron+positron spectrum shows a sharp <lb/>softening [19]. A 1 m <lb/> 2 sr device is capable of detecting ∼220 <lb/> electrons/positrons above 4 TeV in 10 years. <lb/>Space missions, however, pose severe constraints on deployable <lb/>mass and power budget. An innovative design for a space-based <lb/>detector which tries to maximize acceptance and energy resolution <lb/>within a given mass envelope is described in the next section. <lb/> 2. A homogeneous and isotropic calorimeter <lb/> Particle detectors used in cosmic-ray experiments usually <lb/>accept particles only from the top side, i.e. they detect only <lb/>particles coming from the zenith. However, the cosmic-ray flux <lb/> is isotropic up to very high energies, so particles cross the detector <lb/>also from side to side. A detector that could collect particles from <lb/>any direction would therefore be able to observe a much larger <lb/>solid angle, increasing its geometrical factor while keeping dimen-<lb/>sions and mass unchanged. A cubic device, for example, could <lb/>accept particles from 5 of its 6 sides (the bottom one would be <lb/>sacrificed for mechanical support and instrumentation), resulting <lb/>in a five-fold increase of the single-face acceptance. <lb/>According to these principles an isotropic and homogeneous <lb/>calorimeter, designed as a 3D mesh of small cubic scintillating <lb/>crystals, is proposed. The cubes are separated by a small gap which <lb/>has two purposes: to increase the dimensions of the device (thus <lb/>increasing the acceptance) and to accommodate support struc-<lb/>tures and photosensors (see Fig. 1). <lb/>The choice for the scintillating material is tallium-doped <lb/>cesium iodide (CsI(Tl)): this material is the best compromise in <lb/>terms of density (a relatively light material which allows to <lb/>maximize geometric dimensions for a given mass) and radiation <lb/>and interaction lengths (a large depth allows for good shower <lb/>containment and thus good energy resolution). By assuming a <lb/>mass budget of ∼1:6 t, a crystal size of ∼1 Molière radius and a <lb/>0.3 cm gap between crystals, the resulting design is a mesh of <lb/>20 Â 20 Â 20 crystals of 78 Â 78 Â 78 cm <lb/> 3 . <lb/>The calorimeter is very deep in terms of both radiation and <lb/>interaction lengths (for a space project), and features a planar <lb/>geometric factor of (1.91n5) ¼9.55 m <lb/> 2 sr. <lb/>Monte Carlo simulations show that up to 10% of a particle&apos;s <lb/>energy can be deposited in a single crystal during shower devel-<lb/>opment. The resulting required dynamic range to be covered by <lb/>the single crystals varies from 0.5 MIP (to be able to detect <lb/>non-interacting protons) to 10 <lb/> 7 MIPs. To cover such a huge range, <lb/>the proposed readout scheme consists of two photodiodes coupled <lb/>to each crystal: a large area photodiode (∼9:2 Â 9:2 mm <lb/> 2 ) for small <lb/>signals and a small area one (∼0:5 Â 0:5 mm <lb/> 2 ) for large signals, <lb/>each one read out by a high and a low gain amplification circuit, <lb/>for a total of 4 channels per cube. Signals are extracted by means of <lb/>kapton cables (see Fig. 1). The performance of the design described <lb/>above has been studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations; <lb/>results are described in the next section. <lb/> 3. Monte Carlo studies <lb/> A FLUKA-based simulation has been set up for the calorimeter. <lb/>The full geometry has been implemented, including readout <lb/>photodiodes and carbon fibre support structure filling the gap <lb/>between cubes. Isotropic fluxes of electrons and protons have been <lb/>simulated on the top surface (the results are of course valid also <lb/>for the other 4 faces) at different energies from 100 GeV to <lb/>100 TeV. Statistics is lower at higher energies due to increasing <lb/>computational time (Table 1). <lb/>A light yield value of 54,000 photons/MeV for CsI(Tl) has been <lb/>used; the photon collection efficiency has been estimated at 0.8 <lb/>(from a Geant4 optical photon simulation), while the light-<lb/>collection geometric factor due to the partial coverage of the <lb/>crystal face by the 9.2 Â 9.2 mm <lb/> 2 photodiode is 0:92 <lb/> 2  =3:6 <lb/> 2  ¼ 0:065. <lb/>A quantum efficiency of 0.68 has been assumed. Putting every-<lb/>thing together, one obtains a conversion factor from deposited <lb/>energy to electrons of 1.9 Â 10 <lb/> 6 e <lb/> −  /GeV (the small photodiode has <lb/> Fig. 1.

			<body> not been simulated). Electron/hole pairs are also produced by the <lb/>passage of the shower&apos;s charged particles (mostly MIP equivalent) <lb/>through the depletion zone of the photodiode: this produces a <lb/>signal which adds up to the one generated by the scintillation <lb/>light. Assuming an ionization energy in silicon of 3.6 eV, 2.8 Â 10 <lb/> 8 <lb/> pairs are produced for a 1 GeV ionization energy deposit. These <lb/>factors have been used to convert the raw energy deposits from <lb/>the FLUKA simulation to the total number of electrons produced <lb/>by the photodiode. <lb/>Selection criteria have been imposed on simulated events; in <lb/>particular, shower containment has been requested in order to <lb/>have reliable energy measurements for electrons. The selection <lb/>efficiency ϵ defines the effective geometric factor for the particle <lb/>selection: <lb/>GF eff  ¼ ϵ Ã GF singleface  Ã 5 ¼ ϵ Ã 9:55 m <lb/> 2 sr: <lb/> 3.1. Electrons <lb/> The energy resolution for electrons is shown in Fig. 2. The resulting <lb/>value is 2% up to 1 TeV. The effect of ionization on the photodiodes is <lb/>also shown: the energy distribution is shifted towards higher values <lb/>by 1.7%, while the RMS value is only marginally affected. <lb/>The containment criteria for electrons require the impact point <lb/>to be at least 2 crystals away from the border of the calorimeter <lb/>and the shower length (defined as the distance between the <lb/>shower starting point and the exit point of the fitted shower axis <lb/>from the calorimeter) to be at least 21 X 0 . The efficiency of the <lb/>selection is 36%, which gives an overall effective geometric factor <lb/>GF eff  ¼ 3:4 m <lb/> 2 sr. <lb/> 3.2.

			<body> energy deposit greater than 50 MIPs; no shower containment <lb/>criteria have been used. Instead, the signal over real-energy ratio <lb/>has been estimated as a function of the shower length inside the <lb/>calorimeter (see Fig. 3). The initial particle energy can be derived <lb/>from the function fitted in Fig. 3, which correlates shower length <lb/>and signal. <lb/>The resolution at various energies of the primary proton is <lb/>reported in Fig. 4. The typical value of the RMS is around 30%–40%, <lb/>which allows the detection of a slope change in the spectrum. <lb/>Hardware and software compensation techniques are currently <lb/>under investigation in order to improve the energy resolution, in <lb/>particular, the possibility to compensate hadronic showers by <lb/>reading out the Cherenkov light emitted by shower particles <lb/>together with the scintillation light [20]. The selection efficiency <lb/>for protons varies from 35% at 100 GeV to 47% at 10 TeV (the <lb/>increase is due to the requirement on the single-crystal energy <lb/>deposit, while the generally higher values with respect to elec-<lb/>trons are due to the absence of shower containment criteria); the <lb/>effective geometric factor varies accordingly from 3.3 m <lb/> 2 sr to <lb/>4.5 m <lb/> 2 sr. <lb/> 4. Preliminary test beam results <lb/> Two small-scale prototypes of the proposed detector have been <lb/>built and tested at the CERN SPS accelerator facility: a smaller, so-<lb/>called  &quot; pre-prototype &quot; , and a larger one properly called  &quot; proto-<lb/> type &quot; . The pre-prototype is made of 12 CsI(Tl) crystals of 2.5 cm <lb/>side length, arranged in 4 layers of 3 crystals each; the prototype <lb/>has 126 CsI(Tl) crystals of 3.6 cm side length, arranged in 14 layers <lb/>of 9 cubes (Fig. 5). <lb/>For both prototypes, one 9.2 Â 9.2 mm <lb/> 2 Excelitas VTH2090 <lb/>photodiode per crystal has been used (no small photodiode was <lb/>present). Signal readout has been done by means of a CASIS chip <lb/>[21], a double-gain charge sensitive amplifier with real-time <lb/>automatic gain selection. The two calorimeters were tested in <lb/>October 2012 and February 2013, respectively. A muon beam of <lb/>150 GeV/c has been used for the pre-prototype; the signal of MIPs <lb/>is clearly visible with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.5 (Fig. 6). Ions <lb/>with A/Z¼2 at 30 GeV/n and 12.8 GeV/n have been used for the <lb/>prototype. As Fig. 7 shows, the peaks of <lb/> 2 H and <lb/> 4 He are very well <lb/>resolved in layer 1, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 14 for the <lb/>deuterium peak. Data analysis is currently ongoing; the results will <lb/>be the subject of a future publication. <lb/> 5. Conclusions <lb/> Direct cosmic-ray measurements at high energies (PeV for <lb/>nuclei, TeV for electrons) are needed to understand the funda-<lb/>mental processes of acceleration and propagation, as well as to <lb/> Fig. 5.
