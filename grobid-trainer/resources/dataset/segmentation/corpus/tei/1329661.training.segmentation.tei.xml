			<body> INTRODUCTION <lb/> The UVX storage ring, the actual light source from <lb/>LNLS, the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory, have <lb/>always been suffering from longitudinal Coupled Bunch <lb/>Mode Instabilities (CBMI&apos;s) since its RF System <lb/>commissioning. The adoption of the RF phase modulation <lb/>keeps the instabilities under control [1] for most of the <lb/>experiments. The bunch lengthening caused by the RF <lb/>phase modulation does not affect the users. The initial <lb/>purpose of implementing a longitudinal feedback system <lb/>was using the present light source as a bench test for <lb/>Sirius, the next Brazilian 3rd generation synchrotron light <lb/>source. More recently some drawbacks of the RF phase <lb/>modulation appeared: <lb/>  During the commissioning of the fast orbit feedback <lb/>(FOFB) [2] the negative effect of the huge <lb/>synchrotron oscillations was clearly observed; <lb/>aliasing of the synchrotron sidebands produced low <lb/>frequency noise in the BPM readings. A fine tuning <lb/>of the FOFB clock signals had to be done in order to <lb/>reduce the noise produced by the aliasing. The <lb/>tuning system needs to be applied in every event that <lb/>provokes a change in the amplitude or frequency of <lb/>the synchrotron oscillations; <lb/>  The studies for implementing a low-emittance optics <lb/>in the LNLS UVX storage ring also highlighted the <lb/>need of bunch-by-bunch (BBB) feedback systems. <lb/>Large vertical instabilities showed up during the <lb/>tests limiting the beam size reduction. The tests with <lb/>beam indicated that huge longitudinal instabilities <lb/>can prevent the transverse feedback systems of <lb/>working properly. This may be the main reason for <lb/>implementing a longitudinal BBB feedback system. <lb/>This paper presents the evolution of the performance <lb/>parameters achieved during the electromagnetic design of <lb/>a longitudinal kicker for the UVX storage ring. The <lb/>presented design is based on the worldwide reproduced <lb/>waveguide overloaded cavity kicker developed originally <lb/>at DAΦNE in 1995 [3] and improved at Pohang Light <lb/>source (PLS) [4]. Three different geometries are <lb/>compared along this document aiming to propose a good <lb/>compromise between the longitudinal shunt impedance <lb/>and HOM&apos;s content. <lb/> BASIC LNLS UVX RING PARAMETERS <lb/> The UVX ring is not equipped with a full-energy booster. <lb/>Every 12 hours the ring is ramped down, refilled to 250 mA, <lb/>and ramped back up. The energy ramp goes from 490 to <lb/>1370 MeV in about 40 s. The main LNLS storage ring <lb/>parameters are presented in Table 1. <lb/>Table 1: Main UVX Parameters at High Energy <lb/> Parameter <lb/>Value <lb/>Unit <lb/> Nominal Energy, E 0 <lb/> 1.37 <lb/>GeV <lb/>Circulating current, I av <lb/> 250 <lb/>mA <lb/>Circumference, C <lb/>93.2 <lb/>m <lb/>RF frequency, F RF <lb/> 476.066 <lb/>MHz <lb/>Harmonic number, M <lb/>148 <lb/>--<lb/>Bunch length, σ  S <lb/> 11 <lb/>mm <lb/>Horizontal tune, ν  x <lb/> 5.27 <lb/>--<lb/>Vertical tune, ν  s <lb/> 4.17 <lb/>--<lb/>Synchrotron frequency, ω  s <lb/> 25*2π <lb/>krad/s <lb/>Momentum compaction,  <lb/> 0.0083 <lb/>--<lb/>Energy spread, ΔE/E <lb/> 0.281 <lb/>% <lb/>Horizontal damping time <lb/>7.8 <lb/>ms <lb/>Vertical damping time <lb/>7.5 <lb/>ms <lb/>Synchrotron damping time <lb/>3.7 <lb/>ms <lb/> ELECTROMAGNETIC PROJECT <lb/> The LNLS longitudinal BBB feedback system is <lb/>equipped to modulate the correction signal at 2.5*F RF . <lb/>Based on this, as well as on CBMI&apos;s theory, the nearest <lb/>possible center frequency for the longitudinal kicker can <lb/>be 2.25 and 2.75 multiples of RF frequency, i.e., with the <lb/>fundamental mode centered at these frequencies, all <lb/>possible CBMI&apos;s can be covered within a ½ F RF <lb/> (238 MHz) bandwidth (BW). The shunt impedance <lb/>increases with F c and our decision is to take F c = 2.75*F RF <lb/> (1.31 GHz). The initial goal was to achieve the higher <lb/>shunt impedance as possible with several geometry <lb/>parameter sweeps. The HOM&apos;s analysis was made <lb/>together with CBMI&apos;s growth rate (GR) calculations to <lb/>achieve a conservative GR, under 10% of UVX storage <lb/></body>

The entire design process <lb/>of the longitudinal kicker for UVX can be divided into <lb/>stages that can be represented by three different <lb/>geometries, whose parameters are shown in Table 3. As <lb/>will be presented in the next sections, Geometry 3, <lb/>depicted in Fig. 1, was chosen as the final geometry since <lb/>it satisfies the requirements presented in Table 2. <lb/>Figure 1: Geometry sketch of the longitudinal kicker [4]. <lb/>a) Axial-cut view. b) Side-cut view. <lb/>Such cavity can be represented as a pillbox cavity with <lb/>4 ridged waveguides (see Fig. 1a) on each side. Each <lb/>ridge waveguide has one attached feedthrough. One side <lb/>of the kicker receives the correction signal from the <lb/>amplifiers, which is dissipated on external dummy loads <lb/>attached to each waveguide output from the opposite side <lb/>of the cavity. The BW of the fundamental TM 010 mode <lb/>increases significantly with the number of waveguides in <lb/>the cavity. The downstream Four Waveguides Assembly <lb/>is is rotated around the longitudinal axis by 45º relative to <lb/>the four upstream ones. <lb/>Table 3: Geometric Parameters for the Three Kicker <lb/>Models Considered for the UVX Storage Ring <lb/> Geometric Parameters (mm or rad) <lb/>Parameter <lb/>Geom. 1 <lb/>Geom. 2 <lb/>Geom. 3 <lb/> R2 <lb/>84 <lb/>82 <lb/>84.7 <lb/>R3 <lb/>79 <lb/>77 <lb/>79.7 <lb/>  <lb/> 0.42 <lb/>0.42 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>  <lb/> 0.25 <lb/>0.25 <lb/>0.39 <lb/>d <lb/>74 <lb/>67 <lb/>52.8 <lb/>  <lb/> 50.2 <lb/>55 <lb/>42 <lb/>b <lb/>52.3 <lb/>52.3 <lb/>25 <lb/> Design Process <lb/> The procedure for designing the overloaded cavity <lb/>which would attend UVX requirements was based on <lb/>initially rescaling PLS design to our vacuum chamber <lb/>diameter and desired center frequency.

			<body> No concerns have appeared for any of the 3 geometries <lb/>that for the results obtained by the transverse analysis. <lb/>Figure 2: The electric field pattern of TM 01 mode <lb/>calculated with CST. <lb/>The CBMI&apos;s GR has been calculated according to the <lb/>Wang formalism [6], resulting in the Eq. 3 below for the <lb/>longitudinal case, at zero chromaticity: <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> ) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>Re <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>/ <lb/>( <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>) <lb/>Im( <lb/> 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>|| <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>2 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>0 <lb/> 2 <lb/>2 <lb/> s <lb/> s <lb/>R <lb/>pM <lb/>p <lb/>p <lb/>s <lb/>B <lb/> pM <lb/>pM <lb/>Z <lb/>e <lb/>pM <lb/>e <lb/>E <lb/>M <lb/>I <lb/> s <lb/>s <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> (3) <lb/>for the dipole mode a = 1 and for Gaussian bunches with <lb/>uniform filling. The related parameters follow Table 1 <lb/>notation. Additionally, I B = I av /M is the average bunch <lb/>current, ω  0 = 2πF RF /M is the revolution frequency and <lb/>R = C/2π is the average ring radius. <lb/>If the designed cavity did not attend an acceptable GR <lb/>value, solutions that implied changes in geometry <lb/>parameters were tried. Since modifications in geometry <lb/>also change the shunt impedance curve, all design loop of <lb/>this subsection, described up to this point, must be <lb/>redone, until all requirements are reached. <lb/> Geometries Optimization can be illustrated by Fig. 3, <lb/>which shows the longitudinal beam impedance for the <lb/>three geometries. The process has started with Geometry <lb/>1 being the one that came up from rescaling and adapting <lb/>PLS design. However, from Eq. 3, its CBMI&apos;s GR was <lb/>found to be 20% of synchrotron DR. The own <lb/>fundamental mode was exciting the fastest CBM. From <lb/>Geometry 1 F c = 1.31 GHz, we found that if we apply a <lb/>40 MHz center frequency shift on the fundamental mode, <lb/>the CBMI&apos;s requirements would be reached. This shift was <lb/>then applied onto Geometry 2 with the changes listed in <lb/>Table 3, leading to wider bandwidth and lower coupling <lb/>impedance, generating higher growth rates though (~25% <lb/>of DR). In this case, the longitudinal mode L3 at frequency <lb/>3.32 GHz is trapped and excites the fastest CBM. <lb/>Therefore we started working with the possibility of <lb/>damping L3, which later led to Geometry 3. The calculated <lb/>fastest CBM excited by this final geometry has its GR in <lb/>the order of 9.7% of the synchrotron DR. <lb/>Comparing blue and orange lines from Fig. 3, we can see <lb/>how strongly the L3 mode was damped. For doing this, we <lb/>considered three options: a) introducing ferrite; b) inserting <lb/>loop antennas; c) or performing a fine optimization of the <lb/>ridged waveguide, as presented at next subsection. <lb/>Figure 3: The longitudinal coupling impedance for the <lb/>three different geometries. <lb/> Ridged Waveguide Optimization <lb/> The ridged waveguide model (vacuum profile) used on <lb/>the optimization process can be seen in Fig. 4. <lb/>Figure 4: Vacuum profile of the ridged waveguide. <lb/>a) Perspective view. b) Port 1 and port 2 assignment. <lb/>The simulated S-parameters are compared for the three <lb/>geometries, which are discussed in this document. The <lb/>transmission coefficient (S2,1) is shown in Fig. 5. As can <lb/>be seen by the markers 2 and 3, the cutoff frequency of <lb/>the ridged waveguide for Geometry 3 has been reduced <lb/>by 216 MHz to allow the trapped longitudinal mode L3 <lb/>be coupled through the coaxial feedthrough. One can also <lb/>see why this mode grew stronger from the first to the <lb/>second kicker design, when markers 1 and 2 are <lb/>compared. The cutoff frequency has increased by <lb/>22 MHz. <lb/>After waveguide optimization, its geometric parameters <lb/>were kept fixed and the remaining parameters of the <lb/>global kicker structure were readjusted in order to have a <lb/>700 Ω shunt impedance, 1.35 GHz center frequency and a <lb/>300 MHz BW. The BW was set larger than requirements <lb/>in order to compensate the +40 MHz center frequency <lb/>shift. <lb/>Figure 5: Ridged waveguide – S2,1 for all 3 geometries. <lb/> </body>

			<body> EM CHARACTERIZATION <lb/> Geometry 3 was later sent to engineering design and <lb/>machined at our local Machine Shop. Fig. 6 shows the <lb/>resulting structure. <lb/>Figure 6: Machined UVX kicker cavity. a) Disassembled: <lb/>one side of the cavity (left) with 4 waveguides and the <lb/>cavity chamber (right). b) Assembled structure. <lb/>After assembling the waveguides with the chamber and <lb/>attaching all feedthroughs, the microwave measurement <lb/>setup was set, just as shown in Fig. 7. The <lb/>characterization process was focused on comparing the <lb/>measured S-parameters and the shunt impedance curve <lb/>with the simulation results [7]. <lb/>Figure 7: Microwave measurement setup: loaded kicker, <lb/>network analyzer and sliding platform. <lb/>S1,1 parameters were not only calculated by <lb/>simulations but also measured by simultaneous excitation <lb/>of four feedthroughs on the same side. During the <lb/>simulations it can be easily done by taking advantage of <lb/>quarter symmetry. For the measurements, Port 1 of the <lb/>network analyzer was connected to a 4-way splitter that <lb/>feeds the downstream ports. The upstream ports were <lb/>matched with 50 Ω loads. <lb/>Fig. 8 highlights the <lb/>comparison between simulation and measurements data. <lb/>We can observe 8.2 MHz difference between center <lb/>frequencies and 30 MHz difference on BW&apos;s. <lb/>Figure 8: Measured (blue) and simulated (red) S1,1 <lb/>parameters. <lb/>One important point to that needs to be highlighted here <lb/>is the difference between the parameters obtained from <lb/>R sh and S1,1 curves on simulation: later gives a <lb/>BW = 320 MHz <lb/>and <lb/>F c = 1.36 <lb/>GHz, <lb/>against <lb/>BW = 300 MHz and F c = 1.35 GHz from the former (as <lb/>already mentioned on previous section). Therefore, in <lb/>order to calculate the shunt impedance using the <lb/>measured data, a 330 MHz BW was considered. <lb/>The bead-pull method was applied for shunt impedance <lb/>measurement. It was set-up with a sliding platform which <lb/>moves with the rotation of a threaded axis attached to a <lb/>step motor (Fig. 7). The platform movement was <lb/>measured by an encoder attached to it. A nylon string, <lb/>which was holding a 6 mm radius metallic bead, was <lb/>centered by a pulley system and had one end tied to the <lb/>platform and other to a load. For each platform movement <lb/>step, the center frequency was tracked due to S1,1. The <lb/>measured R sh is 700.7 Ω, for a 330 MHz BW. <lb/> CONCLUSIONS <lb/> The LNLS longitudinal kicker geometry has been <lb/>modified during the optimization process. To be more <lb/>specific, the ridged waveguide geometry has been <lb/>optimized from reflection and transmission coefficients <lb/>point of view in order to improve the kicker coupling <lb/>impedance by damping L3 mode. The overloaded cavity <lb/>is already installed in the storage ring and the BBB <lb/>longitudinal feedback system is in commissioning phase. <lb/> </body>
