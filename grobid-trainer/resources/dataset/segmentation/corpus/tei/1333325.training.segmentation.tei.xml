			<front> Encoded Universality for Generalized Anisotropic Exchange Hamiltonians <lb/> Jiri Vala and K. Birgitta Whaley <lb/> Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 <lb/> We derive an encoded universality representation for a generalized anisotropic exchange Hamil-<lb/>tonian that contains cross-product terms in addition to the usual two-particle exchange terms. The <lb/>recently developed algebraic approach is used to show that the minimal universality-generating en-<lb/>codings of one logical qubit are based on three physical qubits.

The timing of the operations is seen to be crucial <lb/>in allowing simplification of the gate sequences for the generalized Hamiltonian to forms similar <lb/>to that derived previously for the symmetric (XY) anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian. The total <lb/>number of operations needed for a controlled-Z gate up to local transformations is five. A scalable <lb/>architecture is proposed. <lb/></front>

			<body> I. INTRODUCTION <lb/> Quantum computation [1, 2] is known to be universal as long as arbitrary single-qubit and non-local (entangling) <lb/>two-qubit unitary operations can be applied in an arbitrarily structured sequence (a quantum circuit) [3, 4]. These <lb/>operations are generated by Hamiltonian control fields, which may be either directly related to interactions intrinsic <lb/>to the physical system of qubits, or may be imposed as additional, external, fields. Universality is thus determined <lb/>fundamentally by the physical structure of the qubit implementation and by control of this. Early studies of uni-<lb/>versality sought on the one hand to establish specific examples of universal gate sets [5], and on the other hand <lb/>to determine whether there were any restrictions on the underlying interactions. This was nicely summarized by <lb/>the pleasing result that &quot; almost any &quot; , i.e., a generic two-body interaction could provide universal operations [6, 7]. <lb/>Now that experimental efforts to implement quantum computation are being undertaken, the question of just which <lb/>interactions to use in a particular physical implementation becomes relevant. In particular, there is often a significant <lb/>distinction between controlling an interaction that is intrinsic to the system, and introducing a new interaction with <lb/>an external control field. In many of the physical implementations that have been suggested to date, the inherent <lb/>physical interactions do not suffice to generate the universal set of quantum computing operations over physical qubits <lb/>and must be supplemented by such additional, external Hamiltonian terms. This may introduce demanding nanoscale <lb/>engineering constraints as well as additional unwanted sources of decoherence. Consequently, the question of whether <lb/>and how we can use a particular physical system containing some very specific, non-generic interactions, for universal <lb/>quantum computation has become very relevant, now that experimental efforts to implement small scale quantum <lb/>logic are underway. <lb/>Recently, Whaley and coworkers [8, 9, 10, 11] have established a new paradigm of &quot; encoded universality &quot; , within <lb/>which the limitations of non-generic intrinsic physical interactions can be overcome by a suitable encoding of the states <lb/>to be used for quantum logic into a subspace of the system Hilbert space that is derived from two or more physical <lb/>qubits. This is achieved with a general algebraic approach that allows the appropriate encoding to be determined <lb/>from analysis of the properties of Lie algebras that are generated by the interaction Hamilitonian. To date, this <lb/>general algebraic encoded universality approach has successfully been applied to two kinds of interactions, both of <lb/>which are variants of the two-particle exchange interaction. The isotropic (Heisenberg) exchange interaction, i.e., <lb/> J <lb/> x  = J <lb/> y  = J <lb/> z  ≡ J (for meaning of the symbols J, see (3)), was proved universal on encodings of three physical qubits <lb/>and higher [10, 11]. Efficient solutions were found for the smallest encoding, when the logical qubit is encoded into three <lb/>physical qubits and the interaction can be implemented between any pair of neighboring physical qubits (arranged <lb/>in a chain or two-dimensional lattice) [12]. More recently, the symmetric anisotropic exchange, J <lb/> x  = J <lb/> y  = J <lb/> z  = 0 <lb/>has also been demonstrated to be universal [8, 9]. Like the Heisenberg case, the smallest encoding here is also three <lb/>physical qubits. In the case of the symmetric anisotropic exchange, it was shown that this could be used to form <lb/>either an encoded qubit or an encoded qutrit [13]. <lb/>These instances of encoded universality derived from a single physical interaction are to be distinguished from related <lb/>results of Levy [14] and of Wu and Lidar [15, 16, 17] for exchange interactions that are necessarily supplemented by an <lb/>additional single-qubit energy spectrum, σ <lb/> z  . With this additional interaction, whether imposed statically or coupled <lb/>to an external control field as in the earlier paradigm of controllable one-and two-qubit interactions, Wu and Lidar <lb/>found a two-qubit encoding that was universal. These authors have applied this approach incorporating the additional <lb/> σ <lb/> z  interaction to more general situations described by Hamiltonians containing exchange interactions with coupling <lb/>coefficients J <lb/> α <lb/>ij  having different values [18]). <lb/>The significance of these encoded universality schemes for quantum computation lies in the fact that they require <lb/></body>

			<body> active manipulation only of two-particle exchange interactions, and hence can be generically referred to &quot; exchange-<lb/>only computation &quot; . They are closely related to numerous proposals for quantum computation in solid state systems <lb/>in which the exchange interaction is a common feature. These can be summarized as follows. (I) The case of isotropic <lb/>exchange, J <lb/> α  = J for α = x, y, z, is represented by spin-coupled quantum dots [19, 20, 21] and by donor atom <lb/>nuclear/electron spins [22]. (II) The symmetric anisotropic exchange, J <lb/> α  = J for α = x, y, includes quantum dots in <lb/>cavities [23], atoms in cavities [24], exciton coupled quantum dots [25] and quantum Hall systems [26]. (III) A more <lb/>general anisotropic exchange, J <lb/> α  = J  = J <lb/> z  = 0 for α = x, y, is represented by the proposal to use electrons on helium <lb/>as qubits [27]. While the general two-body exchange Hamiltonian H  ij  = <lb/> α  J <lb/> α <lb/>ij  <lb/> α <lb/>i  ˆ <lb/> σ <lb/> α <lb/>j  , where α = x, y and z and σ <lb/> α <lb/> are the Pauli matrices, is applicable to these theoretical solid state proposals, we note that this exchange Hamiltonian <lb/>does not contain any cross product terms <lb/> α <lb/>i  ˆ <lb/> σ <lb/> β <lb/>j  , α  = β which may result for instance from the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya <lb/>term of the spin-orbit interaction [28, 29]. <lb/>In this paper we develop the encoded universality representation for the generalized anisotropic interaction that <lb/>results from allowing asymmetry in the exchange tensor, i.e., J  z  = 0, J <lb/> x  = J <lb/> y  , and that also incorporates additional <lb/>cross-terms, ˆ <lb/> σ <lb/> α <lb/>i  ˆ <lb/> σ <lb/> β <lb/>j  , α  = β, in the Hamiltonian. This interaction becomes relevant to some of the recent proposals <lb/>for solid state implementation of quantum computation when additional physical effects such as symmetry breaking <lb/>perturbations [17], originating e.g., from surface and interface effects, spin-orbit coupling [28, 29], dipole-dipole <lb/>coupling in the spin-spin interaction, and anisotropy in exciton exchange interaction in quantum dots [30, 31, 32] are <lb/>taken into account. The asymmetric anisotropic interaction including these cross-terms is also part of a more general <lb/>model considered by Terhal and DiVincenzo [33] in the framework of fermionic quantum computation [34, 35]. <lb/>The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In Sections II and III we use the algebraic approach <lb/>developed by Kempe et al. [8, 9, 11], to establish code spaces for universal encoding of the generalized anisotropic <lb/>exchange interaction. These are found to be two four-dimensional subspaces of the original Hilbert space for three <lb/>physical qubits, characterized by the parity of the bit string (even or odd number of logical values 1). A logical qubit <lb/>can be formed within any of these four-dimensional code spaces. In Section IV we consider how to perform single-qubit <lb/>operations on these encoded qubits. It is shown that the asymmetry of the anisotropic interaction is removed via the <lb/>commutation relations of two-body interaction Hamiltonians within this subspace. The ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  operation is performed on <lb/>the logical qubits via the commutation relations, while the interaction Hamiltonian generates the encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> x  , sufficing <lb/>to generate the entire logical qubit su(2) algebra. In Section V we show how to construct logical two-qubit gates, <lb/>using the example of the controlled-Z gate (often referred to simply as C(Z)), by making use of a relation between the <lb/>commutation relations and conjugation. We find that the resulting conjugating sequences are -up to the duration <lb/>of conjugating operations -equivalent to that obtained previously for the symmetric anisotropic exchange [13], and <lb/>that these results are not affected by the presence of cross-terms in the generalized exchange interaction. Section VI <lb/>discusses implementation issues, including analysis of the efficiency of the resulting gate sequences, and architectural <lb/>possibilities. We conclude with a brief summary in Section VIII. <lb/> II. GENERALIZED ANISOTROPIC EXCHANGE INTERACTION <lb/>A. Asymmetric Anisotropic Exchange Interaction <lb/> The anisotropic exchange interaction between two physical qubits, i and j, is described by the following Hamiltonian <lb/>operator, <lb/> ˆ <lb/> H  ij  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> α=x,y <lb/> J <lb/> α <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> α <lb/>i  σ <lb/> α <lb/>j  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>(J <lb/> x <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  + J <lb/> y <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  ), <lb/>(1) <lb/>where J <lb/> α <lb/>ij  is the coupling strength between the qubits, the upper index α corresponds to either the xx or yy term of <lb/>the exchange interaction, and σ <lb/> α  are the Pauli matrices. If both coupling strengths are identical, the Hamiltonian <lb/>describes the symmetric anisotropic interaction often referred to as the XY model. The encoded universality [8, 11, 12] <lb/>for this case was studied by Kempe et al. [8, 9, 13]. The asymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction is defined when <lb/> J <lb/> x <lb/>ij  = J <lb/> y <lb/>ij  . This can be reexpressed as a sum of symmetric (s) and antisymmetric (a) terms, <lb/> ˆ <lb/>H  ij  = ˆ <lb/>H <lb/> s <lb/>ij  + ˆ <lb/>H <lb/> a <lb/>ij  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>[J <lb/> s <lb/>ij  (σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  + σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  ) + J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  (σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  − σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  )], <lb/>(2) <lb/>where J <lb/> s <lb/>ij  = <lb/> 1 <lb/> 2  (J <lb/> x <lb/>ij  + J <lb/> y <lb/>ij  ) and J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (J <lb/> x <lb/>ij  − J <lb/> y <lb/>ij  ). This asymmetric anisotropic Hamiltonian can be seen to split <lb/>into two distinct parts that act on orthogonal two-dimensional sectors of the four-dimensional Hilbert space if the <lb/></body>

			<body> symmetric term is reexpressed as proportional to (σ <lb/> + <lb/> i  σ <lb/> − <lb/> j  + σ <lb/> − <lb/> i  σ <lb/> + <lb/> j  ), and the antisymmetric component as proportional <lb/>to (σ <lb/> + <lb/> i  σ <lb/> + <lb/> j  + σ <lb/> − <lb/> i  σ <lb/> − <lb/> j  ), where σ <lb/> +  = (σ <lb/> x  + iσ <lb/> y  )/2 and σ <lb/> −  = (σ <lb/> x  − iσ <lb/> y  )/2 are raising and lowering operators of the system. <lb/>These sectors are characterized by the parity of the bit string which refers to even or odd occupation number defined <lb/>as the number of 1&apos;s in the bit string In particular, the symmetric term  <lb/> s <lb/>ij  operates in the subspace spanned by <lb/> {|01, |10}, and the antisymmetric term  <lb/> a <lb/>ij  in the subspace spanned by {|00, |11}. We explicitly point out that <lb/>the symmetric term preserves the occupation number, while the antisymmetric changes this occupation number by <lb/>two. If these pairs of two-particle states are taken to form logical qubit states, then it is easily verified that both  <lb/> s <lb/>ij <lb/> and  <lb/> a <lb/>ij  act as σ <lb/> x  on these pairs of two-qubit states. <lb/>The origin of the asymmetry in the anisotropic interaction can be understood as a consequence of energy non-<lb/>conserving terms in the system Hamiltonian. Since the antisymmetric term is proportional to (σ <lb/> + <lb/> i  σ <lb/> + <lb/> j  + σ <lb/> − <lb/> i  σ <lb/> − <lb/> j  ), it <lb/>represents an energy non-conserving process similar to the anti-rotating wave terms arising in the interaction of a <lb/>two-level system with semiclasical radiation, but happening now in a correlated way on both coupled physical qubits. <lb/>We may assume that asymmetry in the anisotropic exchange interaction between physical systems is a consequence <lb/>of the system complexity when numerous mechanisms of mutual coupling take place simultaneously. An example <lb/>of similar symmetry breaking in the case of the isotropic (Heisenberg) exchange interaction between quantum dots <lb/>derives from the spin-orbit or a, usually weaker, dipole-dipole coupling. <lb/> B. Cross-Product Terms <lb/> In general, it has been recognized recently that anisotropy in the exchange interaction may be accompanied by <lb/>cross-product terms in the two-body Hamiltonian [33]. These can arise, for instance, from spin-orbit coupling [36] as <lb/>noted above. The total interaction can then be described as follows, <lb/> ˆ <lb/>H  ij  = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> α=x,y <lb/> J <lb/> α <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> α <lb/>i  σ <lb/> α <lb/>j  + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/> α =β=x,y <lb/> J <lb/> αβ <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> α <lb/>i  σ <lb/> β <lb/>j <lb/> (3) <lb/>This Hamiltonian can be reexpressed in a form that emphasizes the effect of its various terms on subspaces of <lb/>different parity (the upper index s for odd and a for even): <lb/> ˆ <lb/>H  ij  = ˆ <lb/>H <lb/> s <lb/>ij  + ˆ <lb/>H <lb/> a <lb/>ij  + ˆ <lb/>h <lb/> s <lb/>ij  + ˆ <lb/>h <lb/> a <lb/>ij <lb/> = <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>[J <lb/> s <lb/>ij  (σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  + σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  ) + J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  (σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  − σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  )] + <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>[K <lb/> s <lb/>ij  (σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  − σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  ) + K <lb/> a <lb/>ij  (σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  + σ <lb/> y <lb/>i  σ <lb/> x <lb/>j  )], <lb/>(4) <lb/>where K <lb/> s <lb/>ij  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (J <lb/> xy <lb/>ij  + J <lb/> yx <lb/>ij  ) and K <lb/> a <lb/>ij  = <lb/> 1 <lb/>2  (J <lb/> xy <lb/>ij  − J <lb/> yx <lb/>ij  ). We note that the cross-product terms  <lb/> s <lb/>ij  and  <lb/> a <lb/>ij  act on the <lb/>subspace spanned by the basis states {|01, |10} and {|00, |11}, respectively. Both terms are seen to act as a σ <lb/> y <lb/> operation on these states. <lb/>These subspaces are seen to be spanned by basis sets characterized by the bit-string parity B <lb/> s  = {|01, |10} and <lb/> B <lb/> a  = {|00, |11}. The action of the total Hamiltonian is simultaneous in both subspaces. In particular, the symmetric <lb/>component of the interaction (indexed s) acts only in B <lb/> s  , and the antisymmetric part (indexed a) only in B <lb/> a  . In each <lb/>of the two subspaces the interaction is characterized by the expression J <lb/> k <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> x <lb/> B  k  + K <lb/> k <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> y <lb/> B  k  , where k is either s or a. This <lb/>can be reformulated as <lb/> k <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> + <lb/> B  k  + ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> k * <lb/>ij  σ <lb/> − <lb/>B  k  , where the effective coupling now becomes a complex number, <lb/>˜ <lb/> J <lb/> k <lb/>ij  = J <lb/> k <lb/>ij  − iK <lb/> k <lb/>ij  . <lb/> (5) <lb/>The operators σ <lb/> x <lb/> B  k  , σ <lb/> y <lb/> B  k  , σ <lb/> + <lb/> B  k  and σ <lb/> − <lb/>B  k  now apply to the pairs of states within any of the two-dimensional subspaces B <lb/> s <lb/> or B <lb/> a  . <lb/> III. ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF THE INTERACTION <lb/> The set of asymmetric anisotropic exchange Hamiltonians between neighboring physical qubits, given by (2), <lb/> { ˆ <lb/>H  ij  , 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n}, generates the Lie algebra L, where n is the total number of physical qubits. We consider <lb/>first the Hamiltonian without cross terms. The effect of the cross-product terms will be considered below. We follow <lb/></body>

			<body> here the algebraic approach due to Kempe et al. [8, 9, 11] and first study the properties of the algebra commutant L <lb/> ′  . <lb/>Our goal is to identify suitable encoding of quantum information and so we do not here exploit the potential of the <lb/>algebraic approach in providing a constructive proof for such encodings for general n. Since the symmetric anisotropic <lb/>interaction has been proved to be universal over three-qubit and higher encodings [8, 9, 13], we shall examine here <lb/>only the minimal case where n = 3 to see whether analogous results hold for asymmetric anisotropic exchange. <lb/>We identify two operators as the elements of the commutant: <lb/> ˆ <lb/> Z = <lb/> n <lb/> k=1 <lb/> σ <lb/> z <lb/>k  , ˆ <lb/>X = <lb/> n <lb/> k=1 <lb/> σ <lb/> x <lb/>k  . <lb/> (6) <lb/>Both of these operators commute for even n, and anticommute for odd n. We remark that  <lb/> is a parity operator. This <lb/>commutes with the generalized anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian which preserves the parity. We point out that in the <lb/>case of the symmetric anisotropic (XY) interaction, the commutant becomes larger, represented now by the operators <lb/> and  <lb/>  z  = <lb/>  n <lb/>k=1  σ <lb/> z <lb/>k  [8]. In the case of the isotropic exchange interaction these are further expanded toô <lb/>S  x  and <lb/>  z  [9]. In the present work we focus on the universality properties and do not address the decoherence-free aspects <lb/>of the encoding. Also, we note that including the cross-product terms into the Hamiltonian operator changes the <lb/>commutant structure, sinceê <lb/>X is no longer an element of the resulting commutant. We show explicitly in Section IV <lb/>that the proposed codes derived from the algebraic analysis without cross terms are nevertheless also universal for <lb/>the general case including the cross-product terms. The remainder of this Section will therefore continue to deal with <lb/>the algebraic analysis for (2) alone. <lb/>We assume that the algebra M generated from these operators by linear combination and multiplication is identical <lb/>to the commutant L <lb/> ′  . Then, the splitting of M into the irreducible representations J ∈ J , <lb/> L <lb/> ′  = M = <lb/> J∈J <lb/> I  nJ  ⊗ M (C <lb/> dJ  ) <lb/>(7) <lb/>translates into the structure of the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonian oper-<lb/>ators <lb/> L ∼ = <lb/> J∈J <lb/> L  J  (n  J  ) ⊗ I  dJ <lb/> (8) <lb/>over the Hilbert space <lb/> H ∼ <lb/> J∈J <lb/> C <lb/> nJ  ⊗ C <lb/> dJ  , <lb/> (9) <lb/>where n  J  and d  J  are the dimension and degeneracy of irreducible representation J, respectively. <lb/>For the case of three physical qubits, n = 3 (note that N = 2 <lb/> n  ), the operators  <lb/> and  <lb/> are 8x8 and possess a block <lb/>diagonal structure of four 2x2 blocks <lb/>  B  = <lb/> N/2 <lb/> k=1 <lb/> σ <lb/> x <lb/>k <lb/> ˆ <lb/>Z  B  = <lb/> N/2 <lb/> k=1 <lb/> σ <lb/> z <lb/>k  , <lb/> (10) <lb/>when expressed in the basis set B obtained by a suitable permutation of the standard basis: <lb/> B = {|000, |111, |110, |001, |101, |010, |011, |100}. <lb/> (11) <lb/>The commutation relation taken over these two operators generates  <lb/>  B  = <lb/>  N/2 <lb/>k=1  σ <lb/> y <lb/>k  , and hence the complete su(2) <lb/>algebra over the 2x2 blocks. <lb/>The algebra M is now expressed as the tensor product I  4  ⊗ M (C <lb/> 2  ). Consequently, its commutant M <lb/> ′  -associated <lb/>with the Lie algebra L by our assumption that M is identical to the Lie algebra commutant L <lb/> ′  -splits as M (C <lb/> 4  ) ⊗ I  2  . <lb/>The Hilbert space of this system splits accordingly into two four dimensional subspaces, H <lb/> 8  = H <lb/> 4  ⊕ H <lb/> 4  , which <lb/></body>

			<body> are characterized by different bit-string parities. As expected, these subspaces are not mixed by the interaction <lb/>Hamiltonian (2), which preserves the bit-string parity. The four-dimensional subspaces thus define two independent <lb/>codes that are spanned by the following two sets of code words: <lb/>(I) {|000, |110, |101, |011} <lb/> (II) {|111, |001, |010, |100} <lb/> (12) <lb/>These states are used as convenient basis sets for representing (2). In the following they will be referred to the order <lb/>above, i.e. states 1, 2, 3, and 4 reading from left to right. Before we define the qubit encoding onto these subspaces, <lb/>we first examine the effect of the asymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction Hamiltonian on the code words. <lb/> IV. SINGLE-QUBIT OPERATIONS <lb/>A. Asymmetric Anisotropic Exchange <lb/> As shown above, the symmetric and antisymmetric component of the exchange Hamiltonian (2) act simultaneously <lb/>on two orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces spanned respectively by B <lb/> s  = {|01, |10} and B <lb/> a  = {|00, |11}. <lb/> We now apply this Hamiltonian to the pairs of physical qubits 1-2,1-3, and 2-3, in the three qubit codes given by <lb/>(12). We emphasize that the effect of this interaction is the same for both codes, i.e., for (I) and for (II). In fact, the <lb/>Hamiltonian acts simultaneously and identically on both subspaces H <lb/> 4  , without mixing them, and it can therefore be <lb/>expressed as a direct sum of two 4x4 matrices in the basis of the codes (I) and (II). We now analyze the action of <lb/>the Hamiltonian on these codes. In the code basis (12), the effect of the asymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction, <lb/>schematically summarized in Figure 1, applied to any pair of these qubits possess the following forms: <lb/> H  12  = <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 0 J <lb/> a  0 0 <lb/> J <lb/> a  0 0 0 <lb/>0 0 0 J <lb/> s <lb/> 0 0 J <lb/> s  0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> , H  13  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 0 J <lb/> a  0 <lb/>0 0 0 J <lb/> s <lb/> J <lb/> a  0 0 0 <lb/>0 J <lb/> s  0 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> , H  23  = <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 0 0 J <lb/> a <lb/> 0 0 J <lb/> s  0 <lb/>0 J <lb/> s  0 0 <lb/> J <lb/> a  0 0 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> . <lb/> (13) <lb/>Here the lower index indicates between which physical qubits, i and j, the interaction is turned on, and J <lb/> s  = J <lb/> s <lb/>ij  /2, <lb/>J <lb/> a  = J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  /2 are the coupling strengths for the symmetric and antisymmetric parts respectively of (2), for physical <lb/>qubits i and j. For instance, for a triangular arrangement (shown in Figure 3 bellow) the coupling strengths J <lb/> s  and <lb/> J <lb/> a  are the same in each of the Hamiltonian matrices (13), since they are derived from equivalent nearest neighbor <lb/>interactions. This is necessary for the elimination of the antisymmetric component that is accomplished below via use <lb/>of commutation relations, and it therefore affects the architecture of a potential qubit array. This aspect is discussed <lb/>further in Section VII below. In order to clarify the notation, we provide an example, noting that, e.g., the matrix <lb/> H  12  represents the coupling between the physical qubits 1 and 2 which simultaneously transforms the logical qubits <lb/>1 and 2 (in each of the code spaces (I) or (II)) via the antisymmetric component of the Hamiltonian (J <lb/> a  ), and the <lb/>logical qubits 3 and 4 through its symmetric component (J <lb/> s  ). <lb/>Let us now consider the action of these three matrices and of their commutators. We start with H  12  = (J <lb/> a  σ <lb/> x  ) ⊕ <lb/> (J <lb/> s  σ <lb/> x  ). From (13) it is evident that the symmetric component of H  12  , i.e., the lower right 2x2 block, acts as a σ <lb/> x <lb/> 34 <lb/> operation over the code words 3 and 4 from (12), i.e., the states |101 and |011 from (I), with coupling strength <lb/> J <lb/> s  . It has the same effect over the states |010 and |100 from (II), i.e. it acts as encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> x  on the states in both <lb/>(I) and (II). The antisymmetric component of H  12  , which is the top left 2x2 block of this matrix, acts on the other <lb/>two orthogonal states from the code, namely on |000 and |110 from (I), or on |111 and |001 from (II). This also <lb/>results in an encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> x  operation but with coupling strength J <lb/> a  . This is the first element required for an encoded <lb/>SU(2) operation. The effect of these interactions is summarized schematically in Figure 1. <lb/>The second element is an encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  operation. These operations are generated through the commutator of a pair <lb/>of Hamiltonian operators from (13). For instance, taking the commutator of interactions between physical qubits 1-3 <lb/>and qubits 2-3 yields [H  13  , H  23  ] = i[(J <lb/> a  ) <lb/> 2  − (J <lb/> s  ) <lb/> 2  ]σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  , where σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  acts exclusively on the states |101 and |011. Since <lb/>all other elements of the resulting 4x4 matrix are equal to zero, this commutation relation results exclusively in an <lb/>encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  operator between the code words 3 and 4, i.e., <lb/> [H  13  , H  23  ] = i <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 <lb/>0 0 <lb/>0 <lb/> i[(J <lb/> a  ) <lb/> 2  − (J <lb/> s  ) <lb/> 2  ] <lb/>0 0 −i[(J <lb/> a  ) <lb/> 2  − (J <lb/> s  ) <lb/> 2  ] <lb/>0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> , <lb/> (14) <lb/></body>

			<body> The third and last element required for an encoded SU(2) operation is encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  . It can be easily verified that <lb/>these operations are now obtainable from a second level commutator, namely of the Hamiltonian (13) with the encoded <lb/>¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  operations. For example, [H  12  , σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  ] = i2J <lb/> s  σ <lb/> z <lb/> 34  . <lb/>Together, these three encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> x  , ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  , and ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  operations ensure that any arbitrary SU(2) operation may be per-<lb/>formed on the encoded qubits. The interactions underlying these operations and the combinations just described are <lb/>summarized schematically in Figure 2. We note that the Hamiltonian matrices always act simultaneously on both <lb/> sets of orthogonal subspaces (I) and (II). We can use the encoded operations described above to generate additional <lb/>encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> x  operations that do not simultaneously act on the orthogonal subspaces from the code, by forming the <lb/>commutator between the ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  and ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  operators. <lb/>Analogous sets of operators can be defined starting from the other two exchange Hamiltonians, i.e., H  13  and H  23  . <lb/>The connections resulting from all of Hamiltonian interactions and their commutators are equivalent in each case to <lb/>those illustrated in Figure 1. In total therefore, we have three distinct ways of defining the logical qubit from each of <lb/>the subspaces (I) and (II), with arbitrary SU(2) operations possible on any of these six possible sets of qubits. From <lb/>the subspaces (I) the possible encodings are {|110, |011}, or {|110, |101}, or {|101, |011}. From the subspace (II) <lb/>the possible qubit encodings are {|001, |100}, and {|001, |010}, and {|010, |100}. <lb/> Examination of the commutators derived from each of the three different starting exchange Hamiltonians shows <lb/>that the resulting encoded operations, e.g. (14), are in each case characterized by zeros in the corresponding locations <lb/>where the antisymmetric terms appear in (13). This means that by making use of the commutation relations defined <lb/>by the interactions of two-physical qubits from the three qubit codes, we have completely eliminated the effect of <lb/>that part of the interaction which, as noted before, changes the occupation number of the code by two, and which <lb/>corresponds to the antisymmetric component of the Hamiltonian, J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  (see (2)). Up to a numerical factor given by the <lb/>product of coupling strengths that are accumulated in the course of applying the commutation relations, the problem <lb/>then reduces to that of the symmetric anisotropic exchange solved previously in [9]. We note that in the limit <lb/> J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  → 0, the results of Kempe and Whaley obtained for encoding into three physical qubits [9, 13] are reconstructed. <lb/>The corresponding three-qubit codes, spanned by {|110, |101, |011} or {|001, |010, |100}, define a logical qutrit, <lb/>and the Hamiltonian operators over the code become 3x3 matrices generating the complete su(3) Lie algebra [9]. The <lb/>fact that SU(2) is a subgroup of SU(3) then further implies existence of the truncated qubit representation within <lb/>the three-qubit code that was established in [13]. In the truncated qubit representation, one of the physical qubits is <lb/>kept constant, and is used merely as an auxiliary element for generation of the necessary commutation relations. <lb/>We also remark that the spin-orbit generated anisotropy can be alternatively eliminated to the first order in the <lb/>spin-orbit coupling by suitable shaping of the pulsed interaction between physical qubits as recently proposed [36, 37]. <lb/> B. Cross-Product Terms <lb/> The inclusion of the cross-product terms transforms the Hamiltonian operators given by (13)) into hermitian <lb/>matrices of the same structure whose coupling coefficients <lb/> a  = ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  /2 and <lb/> s  = ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> s <lb/>ij  /2 are now complex (see (5). <lb/>In fact, the situation captured in the Hamiltonian of (4) is the most general anisotropic exchange form containing <lb/>asymmetry in all terms including the cross-products. It provides a generalization of the usual symmetric anisotropic <lb/>exchange referred to as an XY model. <lb/>Under these circumstances, application of the commutation relations between the Hamiltonian matrices (13) is <lb/>still capable of generating the su(2) algebra for single qubit operations. The result of the commutation relation is <lb/>again proportional to the ¯ <lb/> σ  y  operation. For instance, [ ˜ <lb/> H  13  , ˜ <lb/> H  23  ] = i(| ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> a  | <lb/> 2  − | ˜ <lb/> J <lb/> s  | <lb/> 2  )σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  . On the other hand, elementary <lb/>matrix algebra shows that now only two of three possible commutation relations between pairs of complex Hamiltonian <lb/>matrices (13) of the three-qubit code can eliminate the coupling between states of different occupation number and <lb/>thereby generate this encoded ¯ <lb/> σ  y  . The commutation relation which does not generate this transformation is [ ˜ <lb/> H  12  , ˜ <lb/> H  23  ]. <lb/>This fact limits which two of three possible logical qubit encodings should be considered as universal out of the codes <lb/>listed in (12). If only the antisymmetric cross-product term, ˆ <lb/> h <lb/> a <lb/>ij  , in (4) is considered (i.e. K <lb/> s <lb/>ij  = 0) this limitation <lb/>is removed and all three commutation relations can result in cancellation of the antisymmetric component of the <lb/>interaction. The other relations generating encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  and ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> x  hold accordingly. <lb/>In conclusion, the commutation relations suffice to completely remove asymmetry in the most general anisotropic <lb/>interaction, including the cross-product terms σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  . The encodings proposed here provide a direct route to elimination <lb/>of these terms. In Section VI we show how to implement the commutation relations efficiently. <lb/></body>

			<body> V. TWO-QUBIT OPERATIONS <lb/> An entangling two-qubit gate -namely the controlled-Z (C(Z)) operation -is obtained via the following sequence <lb/>of encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  operations: <lb/> ˆ <lb/> U  C(Z)  = e <lb/> i¯ σ <lb/> z <lb/> 1  π/4  e <lb/> i¯ σ <lb/> z <lb/> 2  π/4  e <lb/> −i(¯ σ <lb/> z <lb/> 1  ⊗¯ σ <lb/> z <lb/> 2  )π/4  . <lb/> (15) <lb/>The crucial element of this sequence is the last term on the right hand side. This is enacted by applying the encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z <lb/> operation onto the triplet of physical qubits 2-3-4 that connects two logical qubits within the triangular architecture <lb/>(see Figure 3). To illustrate this C(Z) sequence, we focus on an example with the following encoding of logical qubit: <lb/> |0  L  = |110, |1  L  = |011. The logical two-qubit configurations are then given as <lb/> |0  L  0  L  = |1 10110 <lb/> |0  L  1  L  = |1 10011 <lb/> |1  L  0  L  = |0 11110 <lb/> |1  L  1  L  = |0 11011, <lb/> (16) <lb/>where the boxes indicate those physical qubits which are &apos;bridging&apos; two logical qubits. Via commutation relations <lb/>of the exchange Hamiltonians between the physical qubits 2-4 and 3-4 within the triangular architecture (Figure 3) <lb/>we generate the σ <lb/> y <lb/> 2,3  operation which, when commuted further with the exchange interaction between the qubits 2 <lb/>and 3, results in the corresponding σ <lb/> z  operation. Turning this σ <lb/> z  operation on for the duration t = π/2 results <lb/>in a phase transformation of the states, such that |0  L  0  L  = |1 10110 → e <lb/> −iπ/2  |0  L  0  L  and |0  L  1  L  = |1 10011 → <lb/> e <lb/> iπ/2  |0  L  1  L  . The other two states are not addressed by the encoded operation and remain intact. The resulting <lb/>diagonal transformation over the logical two-qubit states, characterized by diagonal elements {−i, i, 1, 1}, has provided <lb/>the desired entanglement between the logical qubits. We emphasize that we needed one double commutator to obtain <lb/>this transformation. In order to illustrate that this suffices to generate the controlled-Z operation, we first apply an <lb/>encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  onto the second logical qubit for duration t = π/4. This further transforms the relative phase relations <lb/>between the states of two logical qubits to {−i, 1, 1, −i} (up to an overall phase e <lb/> iπ/4  ). This result is equivalent to the <lb/>unitary transformation e <lb/> −i(¯ σ <lb/> z <lb/> 1  ⊗¯ σ <lb/> z <lb/> 2  )π/4  in (15). This transformation, when supplemented by the encoded single qubit <lb/>¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  rotations on both logical qubits, results in the desired controlled-Z operation, C(Z) [2]. <lb/> VI. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES <lb/> We now turn our attention to practical aspects of implementation of universal quantum computation with gen-<lb/>eralized anisotropic exchange interactions. Our goal is now to translate the theoretical development of encoded <lb/>universality with this class of Hamiltonians into an appropriate quantum circuit. So far, we have employed the com-<lb/>mutation relations between the interaction Hamiltonians (13 ) to generate an su(2) algebra over a suitably selected <lb/>qubit from one of the code subspaces (12). A practical question is how to implement the commutation relations. In <lb/>principle, this can always be carried out via the Baker-Hausdorff-Campbell operator expansion [9]. However this does <lb/>not necessarily provide the efficiency required in practical implementation. A useful approach in the present context <lb/>is based on conjugation by unitary operations considered previously by Kempe et al. [8, 11] and by Lidar and Wu [17]. <lb/>Conjugation was recently applied to the case of symmetric anisotropic exchange interactions by Kempe and Whaley <lb/>[13]. The key observation here was that in the three-qubit encoding of a logical qutrit, the complete SU(3) Lie group <lb/>can be obtained through conjugating the evolution operators generated by the symmetric anisotropic Hamiltonians <lb/>over the physical qubits. <lb/>A general feature of conjugation operations that we would like to stress in the present context, is that they can <lb/>provide the same effect over the encoded qubit as exponentiated commutation relations. The goal is therefore to <lb/>find a conjugating condition under which this equivalence holds. In the present case, the antisymmetric term in <lb/>the Hamiltonian (4) complicates the situation, since the conjugating sequence of the unitary evolutions in general <lb/>mixes different states of the code space, and may also result in leakage of the encoded qubit population into the <lb/>orthogonal part of the code subspace. We note however that the mixing effect of the symmetric and antisymmetric <lb/>term of the Hamiltonian (2) can be eliminated by choosing a suitable duration of the exchange interaction. Since <lb/>[ ˆ <lb/>H <lb/> s <lb/>ij  , ˆ <lb/>H <lb/> a <lb/>ij  ] = 0 for any i and j, the unitary evolution operator generated by the Hamiltonian (2) splits into a product <lb/> U (τ ) = exp(−iî <lb/>H <lb/> s <lb/>ij  τ )exp(−iî <lb/>H <lb/> a <lb/>ij  τ ). For a suitably chosen time duration, one of the terms can always be made to <lb/></body>

			<body> generate the identity from the interaction Lie group, if J <lb/> s <lb/> ij  = J <lb/> a <lb/>ij  . At the same time, the effect of the other term can <lb/>be tuned to provide desired transformation. <lb/> A. Single qubit operations <lb/> We now illustrate this possibility of turning off the mixing effect of the antisymmetric terms in the evolution <lb/>operator by judicious choice of conjugation operations, with a specific example. For instance, the unitary evolution <lb/>generated by the σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  operator, resulting from the commutation relation [H  13  , H  23  ], can be obtained from the following <lb/>conjugation: <lb/> ˆ <lb/> U(σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  , φ) = e <lb/> −iσ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  φ  = e <lb/> iH13θ  e <lb/> iH23φ <lb/> ′  e <lb/> −iH13θ  , <lb/> (17) <lb/>where φ <lb/> ′  = φ/J <lb/> s  , and θ is the time duration satisfying simultaneously the two conjugation conditions <lb/> θ = 0(mod π)/J <lb/> a  = <lb/> π <lb/> 2 <lb/>(mod π)/J <lb/> s  . <lb/> (18) <lb/>Due to the asymmetry of the exchange coupling terms (J <lb/> s  = J <lb/> a  ) and to the unitarity of the quantum evolution, this <lb/>condition can easily be fulfilled, as long as the ratio of J <lb/> s  and J <lb/> a  is not a rational number. We note that rational <lb/>numbers create a subset of measure zero within the set of real numbers, and hence it is very unlike that we would <lb/>meet such a situation in experimental implementations. <lb/>In order to further elucidate the effect of conjugation operations, we focus on analysis of the conjugating sequence <lb/>expressed by (17). The timing condition (18) sets the unitary conjugation operator into the following matrix form in <lb/>the code basis (12): <lb/> ˆ <lb/>U(H  13  , θ) = e <lb/> iH13θ  = <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> 1 0 0 0 <lb/>0 0 0 i <lb/> 0 0 1 0 <lb/>0 i 0 0 <lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> = <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>0 i <lb/> ⊕ <lb/> 1 0 <lb/>0 i <lb/> ˆ <lb/>P  24  = ( ˆ <lb/>S ⊕ ˆ <lb/>S) ˆ <lb/>P  24  . <lb/> (19) <lb/>Hereê <lb/>P  24  is the permutation matrix exchanging the basis states |110 and |011 of the code (I), or |001 and |100 of <lb/>the code (II). The operator  <lb/> is an operator inducing the shift of the relative phase by i [2]. We emphasize that the <lb/>antisymmetric term of the Hamiltonian H  13  results in identity, while the symmetric term results in exchange between <lb/>two code words that are phase-shifted by i. <lb/> The identity  <lb/>e <lb/> −iî <lb/> Hτ  <lb/>  †  = e <lb/> −iî <lb/>U ˆ <lb/>H ˆ <lb/>U <lb/>  †  τ  allows us to reduce the act of conjugation of the unitary operation to the <lb/>conjugation of its generator. Since the Hamiltonian matrices, (13), express interactions between different pairs of <lb/>physical qubits within three qubit codewords, they are related to each other by permutation operations. For instance, <lb/>the matrix H  12  = (J <lb/> a  σ <lb/> x  ) ⊕ (J <lb/> s  σ <lb/> x  ) can be expressed as  <lb/>  24  H  23  <lb/>  24  . We can now express the desired conjugation in <lb/>the following form, <lb/> e <lb/> iH13θ  H  23  e <lb/> −iH13θ  = ( ˆ <lb/>S ⊕ ˆ <lb/>S) ˆ <lb/>P  24  H  23  <lb/>  24  ( ˆ <lb/>S <lb/>  †  ⊕ ˆ <lb/>S <lb/>  †  ) <lb/>= (J <lb/> a  ˆ <lb/>Sσ <lb/> x  ˆ <lb/>S <lb/>  †  ) ⊕ (J <lb/> s  ˆ <lb/>Sσ <lb/> x  ˆ <lb/>S <lb/>  †  ) <lb/>= (J <lb/> a  σ <lb/> y  ) ⊕ (J <lb/> s  σ <lb/> y  ), <lb/>(20) <lb/>Via conjugation, we have now obtained the 2x2 block diagonal matrix whose blocks are now proportional to the <lb/>Pauli matrix σ <lb/> y  . This procedure provides a generalization of the well-known conjugation of the Pauli matrices: <lb/> e <lb/> iσz π/2  e <lb/> iσxφ  e <lb/> −iσz π/2  = e <lb/> iσy φ  . It allows us to generate the full su(2) algebra in each block, via conjugation with the <lb/>Hamiltonian H  12  . The block-diagonal structure ensures that the antisymmetric component of the interaction does not <lb/>mixes with the symmetric one. In contrast to the effect of commutation relations between the Hamiltonian matrices <lb/>(13), which eliminate the coupling between states of different occupation number within the codes (12), each block <lb/>in (20) can now be used for single qubit operations over the corresponding code states. For the sake of simplicity, <lb/>we choose the same qubit encodings as emerged from the commutation relations in Section IV. The conjugation can <lb/>alternatively be formulated to generate the σ <lb/> y  transformations corresponding to the other two Hamiltonian operators <lb/>in (13). <lb/>Development of a conjugating procedure for the case of the general Hamiltonian (4), containing the cross-product <lb/>terms, is possible within the same framework. However the relevant timing conditions have to reflect that the <lb/></body>

			<body> coupling coefficients <lb/> a  and <lb/> s  may now be complex numbers. Just as in the previous case, the goal is to generate the <lb/>desired conjugating unitary transformation by exponentiating the appropriate general Hamiltonian operator, where <lb/>the symmetric part of the interaction leads to exchange between the two coupled code words phase-shifted by i, and <lb/>the antisymmetric term results in identity (see (19)). We first illustrate new timing conditions derived from focusing <lb/>only on the antisymmetric term in the generalized anisotropic exchange. <lb/>The antisymmetric coupling acts on the state with even bit-string parity, B <lb/> a  = {|00, |11}. It can be reformulated <lb/>as the sum J <lb/> a  σ <lb/> x <lb/> B  a  + K <lb/> a  σ <lb/> y <lb/> B  a  where σ <lb/> x <lb/> B  a  and σ <lb/> y <lb/> B  a  refer only to the even parity states. In order to establish the <lb/>conjugating condition, this operator is exponentiated and factorized into the product of three unitary operators <lb/> e <lb/> −iJ <lb/> a  σ <lb/> x  Θ  e <lb/> −iK <lb/> a  σ <lb/> y  Θ  e <lb/> iJ <lb/> a  K <lb/> a  σ <lb/> z  Θ/2  . The condition for attaining the identity is then: <lb/>Θ = 0(mod π)/J <lb/> a  = 0(mod π)/K <lb/> a  = 0(mod π)/(J <lb/> a  K <lb/> a  /2). <lb/> (21) <lb/>Considering now in addition that the coupling coefficient J <lb/> s  is complex and its imaginary part is also to be eliminated, <lb/>an analogous timing condition can easily be formulated. <lb/>The second conjugation needed for ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  operations, implementing the double commutator (Section IV), is carried <lb/>out in a similar fashion: <lb/> ˆ <lb/> U(σ <lb/> z <lb/> 34  , φ) = e <lb/> −iσ <lb/> z <lb/> 34  φ  = e <lb/> iH12θ  <lb/>(σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  , φ)e <lb/> −iH12θ  , <lb/> (22) <lb/>Hereê <lb/>U(σ <lb/> y <lb/> 34  , φ) is the result of the first conjugation given by (17). In our example, the condition for the time duration <lb/>of the second conjugating operation generated by H  12  reads as θ = 0(mod π)/J <lb/> a  = <lb/> π <lb/> 4  (mod π)/J <lb/> s  . <lb/> B. Two qubit operations <lb/> We now focus on specific aspects of implementation of the two-qubit gates via conjugation. The entangling part <lb/>of the controlled-Z gate, described in Section V above, is obtained as a conditional effect of the σ <lb/> z  operation on the <lb/>physical qubits of both logical qubits (on the &apos;bridging&apos; qubits). The conjugation however complicates the situation, <lb/>due to its antisymmetric component which affects also the states |1  L  0  L  = |0 11110 and |1  L  1  L  = |0 11011. However, <lb/>the effect of the antisymmetric term in the interaction can be completely eliminated by imposing an additional timing <lb/>condition for the conjugated operation. In our specific example, this operation was generated by H  23  , and the timing <lb/>condition is then given as follows: <lb/> φ <lb/> ′  = 0(mod 2π)/J <lb/> a  = φ(mod 2π)/J <lb/> s  . <lb/> (23) <lb/>We emphasize that this condition has to be satisfied only up to an arbitrary global phase. <lb/> C. Efficiency <lb/> The present approach based on conjugation is much more effective than application of the Baker-Hausdorff-Campbell <lb/>formula <lb/> e <lb/> i[ ˆ <lb/> A, ˆ <lb/>B]  = lim <lb/> n→∞ <lb/> e <lb/> −iî <lb/>A/ <lb/> √ <lb/> n  e <lb/> i ˆ <lb/>B/ <lb/> √ <lb/> n  e <lb/> i ˆ <lb/>A/ <lb/> √ <lb/> n  e <lb/> −iî <lb/>B/ <lb/> √ <lb/> n <lb/> (24) <lb/>whose asymptotic character translates into a sequence of a large number of elemetary operations. In contrast, the <lb/>conjugation requires only three gates for implementation of the encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  operation, emulating a single commutation <lb/>relation, and five gates for encoded ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  , corresponding to a double commutator. The entangling two-qubit operation, <lb/> i.e. the controlled-Z up to the local transformations, is based on generating ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> z  , and hence requires also just five <lb/>discrete gates. This is the same as in the case of the symmetric anisotropic interaction studied previously [13]. <lb/>The timing conditions, expressed in number of gates (18) and (21), translate into a prolonged transformation of the <lb/>conjugating unitaries. It should be pointed out that the duration of the conjugating operation, given by the ratio of <lb/>the coupling coefficients J <lb/> a  and J <lb/> s  in (18) for instance, does not change if larger number of logical qubits defined <lb/>with this three-qubit encoding are addressed with these gate sequences. Therefore this approach scales well with size, <lb/>having only a linear cost in terms of computational complexity as the number of encoded qubits increases. <lb/>An alternative to the present analytical approach based on conjugation is a numerical optimization of gate sequences <lb/>in order to generate the desired quantum computing operations [12]. <lb/></body>

			<body> VII. ARCHITECTURE <lb/> Since the ¯ <lb/> σ <lb/> y  interactions for a given Hamiltonian are defined through the commutation relations with the other two <lb/>available couplings among three physical qubits, the most suitable architecture is triangular. This is summarized in <lb/>Figure 2. An equilateral triangular architecture then ensures that J <lb/> s  and J <lb/> a  are the same within any pair of physical <lb/>qubits taken from a three qubit code. To additionally accomodate also two-qubit logical operations, it is convenient <lb/>to arrange triangles of physical qubits into a linear chain with alternating triangle orientations. This layout is shown <lb/>in Figure 3. Other layouts, such as a hexagonal lattice, may also be employed. <lb/>The implementation of commutation relations between exchange Hamiltonains via unitary conjugation allows for <lb/>a number of other architecture structures than equilateral triangle. The change in the coupling strengths between <lb/>physical qubits, which may result from other architectures, would be reflected in the timing conditions for conjugating <lb/>operations discussed above. In fact, this flexibility is an important aspect of the implementation of the Lie algebra <lb/>of the generalized anisotropic exchange via unitary conjugation, because it allows one to relax the requirement of an <lb/>equilateral triangular architecture, to a lattice of a rectangular or any other structure in order to accomodate physical <lb/>and experimental requirements. <lb/> VIII. CONCLUSION <lb/> In the present work we have demonstrated that encoded universality may be achieved for generalizations of the <lb/>anisotropic exchange interaction that remove the symmetry between exchange components acting in the x and y <lb/> directions, and that also incorporate cross-product terms in the Hamiltonian. Using the algebraic approach due to <lb/>Kempe et al. [8, 9, 10, 11], we find that the Lie algebra generated by asymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction <lb/>within encoding into three physical qubits splits into two irreducible representations that act correspondingly on two <lb/>invariant four-dimensional subspaces of the Hilbert space. Their basis sets are used to define two sets of four code <lb/>words each. Analysis of actions of generalized exchange interactions and their commutation relations within three <lb/>physical qubits results in generation of the full su(2) algebra over a single logical qubit. The most suitable architecture, <lb/>capturing both the physical properties of the code and the interactions among its elements, is a chain of equilateral <lb/>triangles of alternating orientations. Application of encoded operations within physical qubits connecting two logical <lb/>qubits is shown to result in an entangling two-qubit operation, namely the controlled-Z. <lb/>Implementation issues, related to the efficient implementation of the commutation relations among exchange inter-<lb/>actions, were studied in connection with the properties of unitary conjugation. It was shown that the effect of the <lb/>commutation relation between a pair of physical interactions is perfectly mimicked by suitably timed conjugation of <lb/>the unitary operations that are generated by these Hamiltonians. The timing conditions, explicitly formulated here, <lb/>result in significant improvement of implementation efficiency, compared to both the asymptotic approach based on <lb/>the Baker-Hausdorff-Campbell formula and to recent numerically optimized gate sequences for exchange Hamilto-<lb/>nian [12]. The results were found to be valid also in the presence of cross-product terms σ <lb/> x <lb/>i  σ <lb/> y <lb/>j  in the generalized <lb/>Hamiltonian. Within the implementation of unitary operations via unitary conjugation, proposed here, the proposed <lb/>equilateral triangular architecture may be relaxed according to the experimental situation. <lb/></body>
