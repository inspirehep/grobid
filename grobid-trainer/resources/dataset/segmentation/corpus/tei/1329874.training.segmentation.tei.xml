			<body> 1 Introduction <lb/> The Seiberg-Witten monopole equations are formulated for four dimensional compact <lb/> Spin  c  -manifolds. There are some analogues of these equations in higher dimensions (see <lb/>[1, 9, 12, 13]). All of the higher dimensional equations are stated for even dimensional <lb/>manifolds. The Seiberg-Witten monopole equations consist of two equations. The first <lb/>equation is the harmonicity condition on the spinors; this condition is linear and can be <lb/>stated for Spin  c  -manifolds in any dimension. The second equation couples the self-dual <lb/>part of the curvature 2-form with a spinor field and is non-linear. There is no natural <lb/>generalization of the second equation to higher dimensions because self-duality of 2-forms <lb/>in the sense of Hodge is meaningless if dimension  = 4. Still, there are various definitions <lb/>of self-duality in dimensions &gt; 4 (see [2, 5, 6]). <lb/>Recently 7-dimensional manifolds with G  2  -structure have become popular due to the <lb/>works of Bryant, Joyce and Cleyton-Ivanov (see [3, 4, 7, 10]). In this work we also deal <lb/>with 7-dimensional manifolds with G  2  -structure. If M has a G  2  -structure, then M is a <lb/> Spin-manifold (see [11]). As a Spin-manifold, M is then automatically a Spin  c  -manifold. <lb/>The existence of a G  2  -structure on M leads to a decompositions of the space of k-forms <lb/> on M . The decomposition of 2-forms is especially crucial because it enables us to define <lb/>an analog of self-duality of 2-forms on M . <lb/>Using this approach to self-duality and the standard spinor machinery, we suggest an <lb/>analog of the Seiberg-Witten-like equations on 7-manifolds with G  2  -structure and we show <lb/>that these Seiberg-Witten-like equations possess non-trivial solutions. <lb/></body>

			<body> N Deˇ irmenci and N ¨ <lb/>Ozdemir <lb/> 2 Preliminaries <lb/> Let us consider R  7  with a basis e  1  , . . . , e  7  . Endow R  7  with a metric for which the basis <lb/> e  1  , . . . , e  7  is orthonormal and choose the orientation given by [e  1  , . . . , e  7  ]. Set <lb/>Φ = dx  124  + dx  235  + dx  346  + dx  457  + dx  156  + dx  267  + dx  137  , <lb/> (2.1) <lb/>where dx  ijk  = dx  i  ∧ dx  j  ∧ dx  k  . The subgroup of Gl(7, R) fixing Φ is the exceptional Lie <lb/>group G  2  ; it is a compact, connected and simply-connected Lie subgroup of SO(7) of <lb/>dimension 14 (see [3, 4]). <lb/> A G  2  -structure on a 7−manifold M is a reduction of the structure group SO(7) to G  2  . <lb/> Let M be a 7-manifold with a G  2  -structure. The action of G  2  on the tangent bundle <lb/>induces an action of G  2  on ∧  k  (M ). This action gives the following orthogonal decompo-<lb/>sitions of ∧  k  (M ): <lb/> ∧ <lb/> 1  (M ) = ∧ <lb/> 1 <lb/>7  , <lb/> ∧ <lb/> 2  (M ) = ∧ <lb/> 2 <lb/>7  ⊕ ∧ <lb/> 2 <lb/>14  , <lb/> ∧ <lb/> 3  (M ) = ∧ <lb/> 3 <lb/>1  ⊕ ∧ <lb/> 3 <lb/>7  ⊕ ∧ <lb/> 3 <lb/>27 <lb/> where <lb/> ∧  2 <lb/>7 <lb/> = <lb/> α ∈ ∧  2  (M ) :  *  (α ∧ Φ) = −2α <lb/> , <lb/> ∧  2 <lb/>14  = <lb/> α ∈ ∧  2  (M ) :  *  (α ∧ Φ) = α <lb/> , <lb/> ∧  3 <lb/>1 <lb/> = {tΦ : t ∈ R} , <lb/> ∧  3 <lb/>7 <lb/> = <lb/> *  (β ∧ Φ) : β ∈ ∧  1  (M ) <lb/> , <lb/> ∧  3 <lb/>27  = <lb/> γ ∈ ∧  3  (M ) : γ ∧ Φ = 0, γ ∧ * Φ = 0 <lb/> and ∧  k <lb/>l  denotes an l-dimensional G  2  -irreducible subspace of ∧  k  (M ). <lb/>Recall that Spin(7) is the double cover of SO(7) and a 7-dimensional manifold is called <lb/>a Spin one if the structure group SO(7) of M (in the sense of G-structures) can be lifted <lb/>to Spin(7) (see [8, 11]). <lb/>Recall also that Spin  c  (7) = Spin(7) × S  1  /Z  2  with projection <lb/> Spin  c  (7) → <lb/> SO(7) <lb/> [g, z] <lb/> −→ λg <lb/> where λ : Spin(7) → SO(7) is the covering map. A 7-dimensional manifold is called a <lb/> Spin  c  (7) one if the structure group SO(7) of M can be lifted to Spin  c  (7) (see [8, 11]). <lb/>Let M be a Spin  c  -manifold of dimension n. By a complex spinor bundle for M we <lb/>mean a complex vector bundle S associated to a representation of Spin  c  (n) by Clifford <lb/>multiplication, i.e., <lb/> S = P  Spin  c  (n)  ×  κ  ∆  n <lb/> where ∆  n  ∼ = C  2  n  and κ : Spin  c  (n) −→ End (∆  n  ) is given by restriction of the Cl  n  -<lb/>representation to Spin  c  (n) ⊂ Cl  n  . These spinor bundles are bundles of complex modules <lb/>over the Clifford algebra bundle Cl(M ). When n is even the spinor bundle S splits into a <lb/>direct sum <lb/> S = S <lb/> +  ⊕ S <lb/> − <lb/></body>

If the <lb/>dimension n is even, the Dirac operator decomposes into the sum of two operators, D <lb/> ± <lb/> A  : <lb/>Γ (S  ±  ) −→ Γ (S  ∓  ), since Clifford multiplication by vectors interchanges these summands <lb/>(see [8, 11]). <lb/> 3 Seiberg-Witten-like Equations in dimension 7 <lb/> 3.1 The Seiberg-Witten Equations in dimension 4 <lb/> Let M be an oriented, compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold.

The Seiberg-Witten monopole equations on M are <lb/> D  A  ψ = 0, <lb/>Ω <lb/> + <lb/> A  = σ (ψ) <lb/>for ψ ∈ Γ (S  +  ), where S  +  is the positive spinor bundle (see [8, 11]), and <lb/> σ : Γ (S  +  ) → ∧  2,+  M <lb/>ψ <lb/> → − <lb/> 1 <lb/>4 <lb/> i&lt;j <lb/> e  i  e  j  ψ, ψ e  i  ∧ e  j <lb/> and Ω <lb/> + <lb/> A  is the self dual part of the curvature 2-form Ω  A  .

			<body> 3.2 Seiberg-Witten-like Equations in dimension 7 <lb/> Note that the first of Seiberg-Witten equations, D  A  ψ = 0, is linear and meaningful for <lb/>any Spin  c  -manifolds whereas the second equation is non-linear and there is no natural <lb/>generalization to higher dimensions, because self-duality of 2-forms in the Hodge sense is <lb/>meaningful only for 4-manifolds. Our aim is to write similar equations on 7-dimensional <lb/>manifolds with G  2  -structure. Since such manifolds are Spin and thus Spin  c  ones, this <lb/>enables us to construct the spinor bundle and Dirac operator on it. The G  2  -structure also <lb/>provides us with a decomposition ∧  2 <lb/>7  ⊕ ∧  2 <lb/>14  of the space of 2−forms ∧  2  (M ). <lb/>Let M be a 7-dimensional manifold with a G  2  -structure and A the 1-form of a connec-<lb/>tion in the principal U (1)-bundle P  1  associated to the Spin  c  structure on M ; let S be the <lb/>spinor bundle. Then we can define the Dirac operator D  A  : Γ (S) −→ Γ (S). <lb/>Note that, in this case, S does not split into positive and negative parts unlike the <lb/>even-dimensional case. The 7-dimensional version of the first of Seiberg-Witten equations <lb/>is <lb/> D  A  ψ = 0 for ψ ∈ Γ (S). <lb/>For the second equation we need a kind of self-duality of 2-forms — the decomposition <lb/> ∧  2  (M ) = ∧  2 <lb/>7  ⊕ ∧  2 <lb/>14  . Let π  7  : ∧  2  (M ) → ∧  2 <lb/>7  be the orthogonal projection. For η ∈ ∧  2  (M ), <lb/>the self-dual part of η is, by definition, π  7  (η). If π  7  (η) = η, then η is called self-dual. <lb/> First, we define a quadratic map σ : Γ (S) −→ ∧  2 <lb/>7  by setting <lb/> σ (ψ) = <lb/> 7 <lb/> i=1 <lb/> f  i  ψ, ψ <lb/> f  i  , f  i  <lb/> f  i  , <lb/>where f  1  , . . . , f  7  is a basis of ∧  2 <lb/>7  associated to an orthonormal frame e  1  , . . . , e  7  of T  m  M at <lb/>any point m ∈ M . Then the 7-dimensional version of the second Seiberg-Witten equation <lb/>is <lb/> π  7  (Ω  A  ) = σ (ψ) . <lb/> Hence the Seiberg-Witten-like equations in 7-dimensions are <lb/> D  A  ψ = 0, <lb/> π  7  (Ω  A  ) = σ (ψ) <lb/>(3.1) <lb/>where A is the 1-form of the iR-valued connection on P  1  and ψ ∈ Γ (S). <lb/>These equations admit non-trivial solutions. Consider, for example, the flat case M = <lb/> R  7  with the G  2  -structure given by (2.1). Then the spinor bundle is R  7  × C  8  . We use <lb/>the spin representation emerging from the isomorphism Cl  7  ∼ = End(C  8  ) ⊕ End(C  8  ), where <lb/> Cl  7  is the complex Clifford algebra with 7 generators and End(C  8  ) denotes the space of <lb/>8 × 8 complex matrices. A direct verification shows that ψ = (ψ  1  , iψ  1  , 0, 0, iψ  1  , ψ  1  , 0, 0) <lb/>with ψ  1  (x  1  , x  2  , . . . , x  7  ) = e <lb/> − <lb/> i <lb/> 4 <lb/> x  2 <lb/>1  x  2  and A(x  1  , x  2  , . . . , x  7  ) = (ix  1  x  2  )dx  1  + ( <lb/> i <lb/> 2  x  2 <lb/>1  )dx  2  satisfy <lb/>our Seiberg-Witten-like equations (3.1). <lb/></body>
