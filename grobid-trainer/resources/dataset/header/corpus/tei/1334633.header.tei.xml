	<div type="abstract">Abstract The dark energy problem is analyzed from the viewpoint of the time-varying cosmological term. It is demon-<lb/>strated that, at least within the scope of the holographic principle, an experimental value of the vacuum energy density may be<lb/> derived and may be tested quite well with a new small parameter arising in a quantum theory with the fundamental length on<lb/> the order of Planck&apos;s length. Besides, within a theory proclaiming the existence of such fundamental length a high-energy<lb/> deformation of the General Relativity for the space with horizon has been constructed. The obtained results have been applied<lb/> to solving of the dark energy problem, making it possible to frame the following hypothesis: a dynamic cosmological term is<lb/> a measure of deviation from a thermodynamic identity (the first law of thermodynamics) of the high-energy (Planck&apos;s) de-<lb/>formation of Einstein equations for horizon spaces in their thermodynamic interpretation.<lb/></div>
