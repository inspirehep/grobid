	<div type="abstract">We present a general procedure for constructing lattices of qubits with a Hamiltonian composed<lb/> of nearest-neighbour two-body interactions such that the ground state encodes a cluster state. We<lb/> give specific details for lattices in one-, two-, and three-dimensions, investigating both periodic and<lb/> fixed boundary conditions, as well as present a proof for the applicability of this procedure to any<lb/> graph. We determine the energy gap of these systems, which is shown to be independent of the<lb/> size of the lattice but dependent on the type of lattice (in particular, the coordination number),<lb/> and investigate the scaling of this gap in terms of the coupling constants of the Hamiltonian. We<lb/> provide a comparative analysis of the different lattice types with respect to their usefulness for<lb/> measurement-based quantum computation.<lb/></div>
