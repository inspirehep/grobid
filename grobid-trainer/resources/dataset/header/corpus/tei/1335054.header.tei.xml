	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> We study the supersymmetric Wilson loops in the four-dimensional N = 4 super<lb/> Yang-Mills theory in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the gauge<lb/> theory side, it is known that the expectation value of the Wilson loops of circular<lb/> shape with winding number k, W k (C), is calculable by using a Gaussian matrix model.<lb/> In the gravity side, the expectation value of the loop is conjectured to be given by<lb/> the classical value of the action SD3 for a probe D3-brane with k electric fluxes as<lb/> ⟨W k (C)⟩ = e<lb/> −S D3 . However, according to the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence,<lb/> in principle we have to perform the path integral for the D3-brane action in the<lb/> AdS5×S<lb/> 5 under appropriate boundary conditions which should be given in terms<lb/> of data of the Wilson loop at the AdS boundary. We clarify what kind of boundary<lb/> conditions are imposed on the D3-brane from the Wilson loop. As an application, our<lb/> boundary conditions provide a natural interpretation of a position of an eigenvalue<lb/> in the Gaussian matrix model as an integrated flux on the D3-brane.<lb/></div>
