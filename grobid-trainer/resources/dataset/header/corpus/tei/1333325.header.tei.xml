	<div type="abstract">We derive an encoded universality representation for a generalized anisotropic exchange Hamil-<lb/>tonian that contains cross-product terms in addition to the usual two-particle exchange terms. The<lb/> recently developed algebraic approach is used to show that the minimal universality-generating en-<lb/>codings of one logical qubit are based on three physical qubits. We show how to generate both<lb/> single-and two-qubit operations on the logical qubits, using suitably timed conjugating operations<lb/> derived from analysis of the commutator algebra. The timing of the operations is seen to be crucial<lb/> in allowing simplification of the gate sequences for the generalized Hamiltonian to forms similar<lb/> to that derived previously for the symmetric (XY) anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian. The total<lb/> number of operations needed for a controlled-Z gate up to local transformations is five. A scalable<lb/> architecture is proposed.<lb/></div>
