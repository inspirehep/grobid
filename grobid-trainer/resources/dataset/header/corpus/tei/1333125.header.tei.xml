	<div type="abstract">a b s t r a c t<lb/> In this note, we first give a quick presentation of the supergeometry underlying<lb/> supergravity theories, using an intrinsic differential geometric language. For this, we adopt<lb/> the point of view of Cartan geometries, and rely as well on the work of John Lott, who has<lb/> found a unified geometrical interpretation of the torsion constraints for many supergravity<lb/> theories, based on the use of H-structures. In this framework, the constraints amount to<lb/> requiring first-order integrability of H-structures, for a specific supergroup H.<lb/> The supergroup H used by Lott is not the usual diagonal representation of the Lorentz<lb/> group on superspace, but an extension of the latter. This extension appears to be natural<lb/> and it can be related to the super-Poincaré group. We also observe that the constraints<lb/> arising from the requirement of first-order integrability have basically the same form, in<lb/> any spacetime dimension.<lb/> Looking at supergravity from an affine viewpoint (i.e. as a gauge theory for the<lb/> super-Poincaré group), we show that requiring first-order integrability amounts to<lb/> requiring the equivalence, up to gauge transformations, between infinitesimal gauge<lb/> supertranslations acting on the supervielbein and infinitesimal superdiffeomorphisms<lb/> acting on the supervielbein.<lb/> The latter action is performed through a covariant Lie derivative, whose expression<lb/> involves naturally the supertorsion tensor. We use this expression to show that the term<lb/> added to the spin connection, in the supercovariant derivative of d = 11 supergravity, has<lb/> a natural superspace origin. In particular, the 4-form field strength is related to a specific<lb/> component of the supertorsion tensor.<lb/> We conclude by some general remarks concerning Killing spinors in geometry and<lb/> supergravity, discussing their possible interpretations, as Killing vector fields on a specific<lb/> supermanifold on one hand, and as parallel spinors for an appropriate connection on the<lb/> other hand. We show that this last interpretation is very natural from the point of view of<lb/> Klein and Cartan geometries.<lb/></div>
