	<div type="abstract">The asymptotic behavior of the Weyl tensor and metric tensor is investigated for probably all<lb/> as~~ptotically flat solutions of the empty space Einstein field equations. The systematic investigation<lb/> utilizes a set of first order differential equations which are equivalent to the empty space Einstein<lb/> equations. These are solved asymptotically, subject to a condition imposed on a tetrad component<lb/> of the Riemann tensor \[fo which ensures the approach to flatness at spatial infinity of the space-time.<lb/> If \[fo. is assumed to be an analytic function of a suitably defined radial coordinate, uniqueness of the<lb/> s?lutlOns can be proved. However, this paper makes considerable progress toward establishing a<lb/> ngorous proof of uniqueness in the nonanalytic case. A brief discussion of the remaining coordinate<lb/> freedom, with certain topological aspects, is also included.<lb/></div>
