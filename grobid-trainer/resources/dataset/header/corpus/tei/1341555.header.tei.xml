	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Hurwitz numbers, which count certain covers of the projective<lb/> line (or, equivalently, factorizations of permutations into transpositions), have<lb/> been extensively studied for over a century. The Gromov-Witten potential F<lb/> of a point, the generating series for Hodge integrals on the moduli space of<lb/> curves, has been a central object of study in Gromov-Witten theory. We define<lb/> a slightly enriched Gromov-Witten potential G (including integrals involving<lb/> one &quot; Î»-class &quot; ), and show that after a non-trivial change of variables, G = H<lb/> in positive genus, where H is a generating series for Hurwitz numbers. We<lb/> prove a conjecture of Goulden and Jackson on higher genus Hurwitz numbers,<lb/> which turns out to be an analogue of a genus expansion ansatz of Itzykson and<lb/> Zuber. As consequences, we have new combinatorial constraints on F , and a<lb/> much more direct proof of the ansatz of Itzykson and Zuber.<lb/> We can produce recursions and explicit formulas for Hurwitz numbers; the<lb/> algorithm presented should prove &quot; all &quot; such recursions. Furthermore, there are<lb/> many more recursions than previously suspected from geometry (and indeed<lb/> they should exist in all genera); as examples we present surprisingly simple<lb/> new recursions in genus up to 3 that are geometrically mysterious.<lb/> As we expect this paper also to be of interest to combinatorialists, we<lb/> have tried to make it as self-contained as possible, including reviewing some<lb/> results and definitions well known in algebraic and symplectic geometry, and<lb/> mathematical physics.<lb/></div>
