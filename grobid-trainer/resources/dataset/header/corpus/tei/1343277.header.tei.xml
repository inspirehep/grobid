	<div type="abstract">Abstract: One of the guaranteed fluxes under study by the IceCube neutrino telescope are neutrinos originating from<lb/> cosmic ray induced air showers. These neutrinos come from the decay of Ï€ and K mesons (the conventional flux) and<lb/> from the decay of charmed mesons (the prompt flux). Although several flux predictions exist, the electron neutrino flux<lb/> has been measured only up to GeV energies. At TeV energies, where atmospheric neutrinos are an inevitable source<lb/> of background events for astrophysical neutrino searches, the prompt flux becomes important and the flux predictions<lb/> vary greatly. The detection of electromagnetic and hadronic particle showers, which are not only produced by electron<lb/> neutrinos but which can be found in the final states of charged and neutral current interactions of all neutrino flavours,<lb/> remains challenging. Given the sensitivity to all neutrino flavours, the good energy resolution that will be possible with<lb/> fully contained shower events and the possibility to isolate the prompt from the conventional flux, the prospects of this<lb/> detection channel are very promising. This poster will present an analysis done on a data sample collected with IceCube<lb/> in its 40 string configuration as it was running from 2008 to 2009. The development of the event selection on a small part<lb/> of the sample will be discussed.<lb/></div>
