	<div type="abstract">Abstract. The peculiarity of the Eckart potential problem on H<lb/> 2<lb/> + (the upper sheet of the<lb/> two-sheeted two-dimensional hyperboloid), to preserve the (2l + 1)-fold degeneracy of the<lb/> states typical for the geodesic motion there, is usually explained in casting the respective<lb/> Hamiltonian in terms of the Casimir invariant of an so(2,1) algebra, referred to as potential<lb/> algebra. In general, there are many possible similarity transformations of the symmetry<lb/> algebras of the free motions on curved surfaces towards potential algebras, which are not<lb/> all necessarily unitary. In the literature, a transformation of the symmetry algebra of the<lb/> geodesic motion on H<lb/> 2<lb/> + towards the potential algebra of Eckart&apos;s Hamiltonian has been<lb/> constructed for the prime purpose to prove that the Eckart interaction belongs to the class<lb/> of Natanzon potentials. We here take a different path and search for a transformation<lb/> which connects the (2l +1) dimensional representation space of the pseudo-rotational so(2,1)<lb/> algebra, spanned by the rank-l pseudo-spherical harmonics, to the representation space of<lb/> equal dimension of the potential algebra and find a transformation of the scaling type. Our<lb/> case is that in so doing one is producing a deformed isometry copy to H<lb/> 2<lb/> + such that the<lb/> free motion on the copy is equivalent to a motion on H<lb/> 2<lb/> + , perturbed by a coth interaction.<lb/> In this way, we link the so(2,1) potential algebra concept of the Eckart Hamiltonian to<lb/> a subtle type of pseudo-rotational symmetry breaking through H<lb/> 2<lb/> + metric deformation.<lb/> From a technical point of view, the results reported here are obtained by virtue of certain<lb/> nonlinear finite expansions of Jacobi polynomials into pseudo-spherical harmonics. In due<lb/> places, the pseudo-rotational case is paralleled by its so(3) compact analogue, the cotangent<lb/> perturbed motion on S<lb/> 2 . We expect awareness of different so(2,1)/so(3) isometry copies to<lb/> benefit simulation studies on curved manifolds of many-body systems.<lb/></div>
