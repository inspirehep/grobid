	<div type="abstract">Abstract. In [BBK10] it was shown how so-called wonderful compactifica-<lb/>tions can be used for renormalization in the position space formulation of<lb/> quantum field theory. This article aims to continue this idea, using a slightly<lb/> different approach; instead of the subspaces in the arrangement of divergent<lb/> loci, we use the poset of divergent subgraphs as the main tool to describe the<lb/> whole renormalization process. This is based on [Fei05] where wonderful mod-<lb/>els were studied from a purely combinatorial viewpoint. The main motivation<lb/> for this approach is the fact that both, renormalization and the model con-<lb/>struction, are governed by the combinatorics of this poset. Not only simplifies<lb/> this the exposition considerably, but also allows to study the renormalization<lb/> operators in more detail. Moreover, we explore the renormalization group in<lb/> this setting by studying how the renormalized distributions behave under a<lb/> change of renormalization points.<lb/></div>
