	<div type="abstract">Recently the connection between Majorana fermions bound to defects in arbitrary dimensions,<lb/> and complex momentum roots of the the vanishing determinant of the corresponding bulk BdG<lb/> Hamiltonian, has been established (arXiv:1503.03839). Based on this understanding, a formula has<lb/> been proposed to count the number (n) of the zero energy Majorana bound states, which is related<lb/> to the topological phase of the system. In this paper, we apply this formula to a variety of 1d and<lb/> 2d models belonging to the classes BDI, DIII and D. We show that we can successfully chart out<lb/> the topological phase diagrams. Studying these examples also enables us to explicitly observe the<lb/> correspondence between these complex momentum solutions in the Fourier space, and the localized<lb/> Majorana fermion wavefunctions in the position space. Finally, we corroborate the fact that for<lb/> systems with a chiral symmetry, these solutions are the so-called &quot; Exceptional Points &quot; , where two<lb/> or more eigenvalues of the complexified Hamiltonian coalesce.<lb/></div>
