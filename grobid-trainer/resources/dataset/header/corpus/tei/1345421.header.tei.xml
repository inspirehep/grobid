	<div type="abstract">Abstract. An evaluation of data obtained with the (n, n<lb/> ′ γ) technique revealed in near<lb/> spherical nuclei strong M1 components in transitions connecting higher-lying 3<lb/> −<lb/> i states with the<lb/> 3<lb/> −<lb/> 1 state. The ⟨3<lb/> −<lb/> 1 |M 1|3<lb/> −<lb/> i ⟩ matrix elements of these transitions are in the order of 1 µN . In the<lb/> quadrupole sector strong ⟨2<lb/> +<lb/> 1 |M 1|2<lb/> +<lb/> ms ⟩ matrix elements serve as fingerprints for the identification<lb/> of low-lying 2<lb/> +<lb/> ms isovector states, which are commonly referred to as mixed-symmetry states.<lb/> The ratio of the two matrix elements scales for most candidates to unity indicating similar<lb/> physics. Additional evidence for the assignment of the 3<lb/> −<lb/> i states as low-lying octupole isovector<lb/> states is provided by particle-scattering experiments, e.g. (e, e<lb/> ′ ) or (p, p<lb/> ′ ). The octupole states<lb/> under investigation exhibit enhanced scattering cross sections. This observation is in accordance<lb/> with the assignment of a one-phonon nature to these octupole excitations.<lb/></div>
