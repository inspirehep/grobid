	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> At the present time a theory of gravity is subdivided into two ab-<lb/>solutely different parts: low-energy theory represented by the Gen-<lb/>eral Relativity (GR) and hypothetical high-energy theory – Quan-<lb/>tum Gravity (QG) – that is still unresolved. In this way there is<lb/> a certain dichotomy in gravity considered as a unified theory. This<lb/> paper is an effort to reveal the main causes for such a dichotomy;<lb/> the means for departure from this dichotomy are proposed. By one<lb/> of the approaches gravity is considered at low and at high ener-<lb/>gies as a single whole dependent on the same parameters, which are<lb/> discrete for the fundamental length if present.There are grounds to<lb/> believe that in this case the mathematical formalism must be modi-<lb/>fied – all infinitesimal space-time quantities must be replaced by the<lb/> corresponding finite quantities dependent on the existent energies.<lb/> Possible approaches to this problem are proposed with the proper<lb/> illustrations.<lb/></div>
