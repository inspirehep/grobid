	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> We consider special series in ratios of the Schur functions which are defined by integers f ≥ 0<lb/> and e ≤ 2, and also by the set of 3k parameters ni, qi, ti, i = 1, . . . , k. These series may be presented<lb/> in form of matrix integrals. In case k = 0 these series generates Hurwitz numbers for the d-fold<lb/> branched covering of connected surfaces with a given Euler characteristic e and arbitrary profiles at<lb/> f ramification points. If k &gt; 0 they generate weighted sums of the Hurwitz numbers with additional<lb/> ramification points which are distributed between color groups indexed by i = 1, . . . , k, the weights<lb/> being written in terms of parameters ni, qi, ti. By specifying the parameters we get sums of all<lb/> Hurwitz numbers with f arbitrary fixed profiles and the additional profiles provided the following<lb/> condition: both, the sum of profile lengths and the number of ramification points in each color group<lb/> are given numbers. In case e = f = 1, 2 the series may be identified with BKP tau functions of Kac<lb/> and van de Leur of a special type called hypergeometric tau functions. Sums of Hurwitz numbers for<lb/> d-fold branched coverings of RP<lb/> 2 are related to the one-component BKP hierarchy. We also present<lb/> links between sums of Hurwitz numbers and one-matrix model of the fat graphs.<lb/></div>
